Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in information or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. The floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 16, 2021. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy. As we all know, we're still experiencing hard times in many regions, as COVID cases continue and new variants of the virus emerge. But I hope you share my optimism that with progress in vaccinations and continued adherence to safety protocols, better days are ahead. The year 2020 will be remembered for COVID-19, but for Zoetis it also reaffirms the resilience of our business, the essential nature of animal health and the agility and dedication of our colleagues in the face of industry and personal challenges. Throughout the year, we successfully ensured colleagues' safety and maintained reliable supply for our customers. We kept driving innovation and strengthening our diverse portfolio of 13 blockbusters and more than 300 product lines across eight species and seven major product categories. We successfully launched our triple combination parasiticide Simparica Trio. We also achieved approvals for the first ever long acting monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, with Librela\u2019s authorization for dogs in the European Union and several other markets, and Solensia\u2019s first authorization for cats in Switzerland. We also continue to build on our vaccine portfolio in livestock with the approval of our CircoMax [Myco] [ph] swine vaccine in the European Union. And in poultry, we continued advancing our recombinant vector vaccine with the approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT-IBD in the U.S. Meanwhile, in diagnostics, we successfully launched Vetscan Imagyst, our breakthrough platform using cloud-based artificial intelligence for veterinary clinics. We were able to do all this while staying anchored to our purpose, and advancing the five long-term priorities that I set out at the beginning of the year, including sustainability, where we made important progress in our ESG programs and metrics reporting. We look forward to sharing our long-term ESG goals in the coming weeks. And finally, we delivered financial results for 2020 that were in line with the guidance we provided last February before the impact of the global pandemic was known. For the full year, we generated 9% operational growth in revenue, primarily based on new products in our companion animal business, the continued strength of our key dermatology portfolio and growth in China. And as part of our long-term value proposition, we once again grew revenues faster than the anticipated growth for 2020 and faster than the historical industry rates of 4% to 6%. As part of our value proposition, we also delivered on growing our adjusted net income faster than revenue. For the full year, we delivered operational growth of 10% in adjusted net income while adapting our operations within pandemic, and continuing investments in our pipeline and new product launches. We generated strong fourth quarter results, which Glenn will discuss in a minute. And these performance trends give us confidence in our growth drivers and strong momentum for 2021. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in 2021, driven by ongoing strength in pet care, continued expansion in markets outside the U.S., most notably China, and acceleration of our diagnostics portfolio penetration. We are guiding to operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue for full year 2021. Growth expectations for the companion animal market are in the mid single digits. And we expect [indiscernible] to grow significantly faster than that based on the continued uptake of Simparica Trio, the strength of our key dermatology portfolio and the launch of monoclonal antibodies in markets outside the U.S. Positive pet care trends during the pandemic based on increased adoptions and people spending more time with their pets should continue driving market growth in the near-term. Data in the U.S. shows visits to veterinary clinics have rebounded and the average revenue per visit has continued to increase. Over the long-term, we see these trends moderating as adoption rates normalize and people eventually returned to the workplace. The specialty care regimen and chronic care treatment that began in the pandemic should continue, and our innovative portfolio across dermatology, parasiticide, pain, vaccines and diagnostics have us well positioned for continued growth [impacting] [ph] share as we shift the curve. In terms of livestock market, we expect low single digit market growth in 2021, as the impact from COVID-19 will still be felt as a number of products experienced loss of exclusivity. We expect the [indiscernible] to grow in line with the market, even as we face increased headwinds from generic competition for Draxxin, our leading anti-infective product. We are confident we can leverage our lifecycle innovation strategies together with the overall diversity of our livestock portfolio, including swine product sales in China, to help us address the loss of exclusivity for Draxxin and maintain livestock growth that will support our 2021 guidance. Longer-term, we will continue to invest in livestock innovations and data-driven animal agricultural solutions. As we continue through 2021, we will be building on the progress against our five priorities; driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high-performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. Our investment plans and focus on growth for 2021 include continuing the successful launch of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and other markets, as well as the ongoing adoption of other new parasiticide, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12. Driving growth in dermatology through increased use of direct-to-consumer advertising and disease awareness campaigns in the U.S. and globally. Our focus remains on growing this market and increasing customer loyalty to our innovative treatments, which we expect to help us top $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. As noted earlier, we'll be investing in the launch of the first monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in Europe in the first half of 2021, and advancing the regulatory process in the U.S. and other markets. While we remain confident in the eventual U.S. approval of these products based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted, at this point, we believe it is unlikely we will receive approvals for Solensia or Librela in the U.S. in 2021. We continue to work through regulatory reviews and manufacturing inspections with the FDA, and we will continue to keep you updated on this process on future calls. And finally, we're continuing our development of digital and data solutions that will support more individualized animal care and more efficient and sustainable operations for producers. In conclusion, I'm incredibly proud of what our people accomplished in the face of such uncertainty during 2020, and it gives me great confidence in our continued success and full year guidance for 2021. As we navigate through recovery from the global pandemic and capitalize on the growth opportunities we see ahead, but optimism comes from what drove us over the last year. The resilience and essential nature of the animal health industry, the diversity, innovation, and market leadership of our portfolio, and the agility and passion of our colleagues to face any challenge. Now, let me hand it off to Glenn, who will speak more about our fourth quarter results and guidance for the full year 2021.\nGlenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.7 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, both exceeding the high-end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 9% operationally and 7% on a reported basis, with adjusted net income increasing 10% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. Going deeper into the numbers, price contributed 2% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 7%. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions with other in line products flat for the year. We again saw broad-based revenue growth with U.S. growing 11% and international growing 7%, operationally. The innovation we brought to the market and the diversity of our portfolio was key to our strong performance, as companion animal grew 17% while livestock was flat on a year-over-year basis. Performance from companion animal was led by our parasiticide portfolio bolstered by the launch of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $170 million. This added approximately $150 million of incremental revenue and exceeded our expectations set prior to the pandemic. Sales of Simparica also grew double digits for the year with operational revenue growth of 16%. Our key dermatology portfolio demonstrated continued strength in 2020, growing 23% operationally, generating revenue of $925 million and increasing more than $170 million versus prior year. The COVID-19 pandemic created a difficult market environment for livestock. However, we are encouraged by the resiliency displayed in 2020. We remain optimistic that global livestock will return to modest growth in 2021 as the recovery from African swine fever in China continues and consumption patterns normalize. Operational growth and adjusted net income of 10% was driven mainly by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Now moving on to our Q4 financial results, where we posted another strong quarter with revenue of $1.8 billion, representing an increase of 9% operationally and 8% reported. Adjusted net income of $438 million is an increase of 3% operationally and flat on a report basis. Operational revenue grew 9% with 2% from price and 7% from volume. Volume growth of 7% consisted of 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 1% from other in line products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 25% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal parasiticide grew 52% in the quarter, gaining market share in the U.S. of more than 7% in the flea, tick and heartworm segment versus the same period in the prior year. This includes the continued adoption of Simparica Trio which generated sales of $60 million in Q4. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint again had significant global growth in the quarter with $257 million of revenue, representing 27% operational growth versus an extremely difficult comparative period in which key derm grew 29% for the fourth quarter of last year. Our diagnostics portfolio again made positive contributions to revenue with reference lab expansion and double-digit growth in consumable and instrument revenue. The recovery in wellness visits continues to be a catalyst for growth following the slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. As we noted on our previous earnings call, the early fall cattle run hold a portion of fourth quarter sales into the third quarter, leading to a weaker quarter in cattle than we would typically expect. This was the primary driver of the 5% operational decline in livestock for the fourth quarter. For the remainder of the livestock portfolio, swine posted a second consecutive quarter of growth. With the herd rebuild continue in key accounts as the market recovers from African Swine Fever in China. Our aquaculture business grew high-single digits in the quarter and along with swine partially offset the decline in cattle and poultry. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment in the quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% with companion animal products growing 30% and livestock sales declining by 15%. For companion animal, the positive trends at the vet clinic continued in Q4 with patient visits up 2% and revenue per visit increasing by 13%. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of our Simparica franchise, as well as key dermatology products. We maintained an increase investment in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas and continue to see a good return on that investment. Simparica Trio performed well again in the quarter, with sales of $56 million. We remain extremely encouraged for the future growth of our product and the growth of the overall market segment as a material portion of Trio sales came from new patients to the category. Key dermatology sales were $176 million for the quarter, growing 32% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics. Companion animal diagnostics sales increased 22% in the quarter as a result of reconciled expansion and growth in point of care instruments and consumables. U.S. livestock declined 15% in the quarter driven primarily by cattle, which had a portion of Q4 sales pulled into the third quarter as a result of the earlier movement from pasture to feedlot. The remaining species declined as well with COVID-19 and pricing pressure negatively impacting our swine business. Poultry declines are largely attributed to product rotation and less producer profitability, leading to reduced usage of our premium products. To summarize U.S. performance innovation and return on investment, once again drove exceptionally strong growth in companion animal, while livestock was down in the quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. Revenue in our international segment grew 7% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and key dermatology products. Parasiticide growth in the quarter was again driven by comparative franchise with further adoption of Simparica Trio. In Q4 we observed a series of favorable market trends, such as increased pet ownership and medicalization rates in Asia. Overall companion animal grew in every major market except Italy and the UK, which had arguably the strictest lockdown protocols. Companion animal diagnostics grew 16% in the quarter led by an increase in point of care consumable usage. Swine revenue grew 14% operationally, posting a third consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Swine sales in China grew in excess of a 100% for the second straight quarter. Key accounts expanded their use of vaccines and other products as they continue to rebuild herds from smaller farms to large scale operations. China, total products grew 45% operationally in the quarter and 34% operationally for 2020. Brazil was also a significant contributor to international growth in the quarter, growing 18% operationally. For the fourth quarter and full year 2020, Brazil delivered double digit growth in all species except poultry, which modestly declined. Overall, our International segment delivered strong results despite the challenges presented by COVID-19. Our diversity across products and geographies enabled our International segment to again be a significant driver of growth. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, adjusted gross margin of 67.7%, fell 80 basis points in a reported basis compared to the prior year resulting from other manufacturing costs, inventory charges, recent acquisitions and elevated freight expense. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 10% operationally, resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense with Simparica Trio and Apoquel, partially offset by T&E savings. Return on investment from our DTC campaigns has been very favorable and we remain \u2013 and will remain an important investment to support future growth of the business. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points driven by the impact of net the discrete tax benefits, partially offset by jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter grew 3% operationally. In December, we announced 25% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In addition, we resumed our share repurchase program in January with $1.4 billion of remaining capacity under the current authorization. Now moving on to the guidance for 2021, please note the guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. For 2021, we are projecting revenue between $7.4 billion and $7.55 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We are expecting foreign exchange favorability in 2021 of approximately 200 basis points. We expect companion animal to be the primary driver of growth in 2021 with the continued strength of our diversed parasiticide portfolio which includes full year of Simparica Trio sales. We believe market dynamics for companion animal will remain strong in 2021, allowing for further expansion of our key dermatology products, as well as our diagnostics offerings, which we anticipate will grow faster than the overall animal health market. While we expect the pace of certain trends that accelerated in 2020 to moderate, such as increased spend per visit. Our view is that 2020 has a status of the higher base for future growth. We anticipate livestock will return to global growth in 2021, primarily driven by more normalized food consumption patterns. Geographically, we expect total company sales growth to be relatively balanced between our U.S. and International segments. However, we do expect continued and meaningful growth in China and other emerging markets. I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with dermatology, our guidance does not assume a meaningful competitive entry in 2021. And with continued investments behind the franchise, we believe revenue will exceed $1 billion for the full year. We also do not assume the triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2021 to compete against Simparica Trio. We're extremely excited about our monoclonal antibodies for pain, with both Librela and Solensia having long-term blockbuster potential. However, as Kristin mentioned, while both products will launch in the first half of 2021 in the EU and other international markets, we do not currently expect either product to receive approval in the U.S. this year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 30%, which is relatively consistent with our cost of sales in 2020. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $1.775 billion and $1.85 billion. With the increase in 2020 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including recent and future product launches, key brands and recent acquisitions, and reference lab expansion in diagnostics. Adjusted R&D expense for 2021 is expected to be between $500 million and $520 million as we remain committed to investing in pipeline opportunities for new therapies and life cycle innovation. Adjusted interest and other incomes deductions is expected to be approximately $260 million with the increase over 2020 driven by increased interest expense, as well as lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2021 is primarily related to the impact of favorable non-recurring discrete items that occurred in 2020. Adjusted net income is expected to be in a range of $2.08 billion to $2.13 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 12%. Our guidance reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, during the year when we'll be making meaningful investments to support future growth. Consistent with 2020, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures in 2021 to support investments in manufacturing, focused on internal sourcing of API, capacity increases and facilities to support pipeline opportunities. We're also investing in information technology to support our recent acquisitions, as well as digital capabilities and data analytics. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.36 to $4.46 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14. While guidance represents full-year expectations, we do anticipate growth will be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. This is largely due to full-year Simparica Trio sales and a favorable comparison versus Q2 2020 as a result of COVID-19. To summarize 2020 was another exceptional year in which we delivered 9% operational revenue growth and 10% operational growth and adjusted net income. And the year represented a unique set of challenges. Our guidance for 2021 highlights our ability to grow revenue organically above the market and grow adjusted net income faster than revenue even during times of elevated investment. Before turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to express how proud I am of our colleagues and all we've accomplished amidst an unprecedented set of circumstances. While there is no assurance that the New Year will be without similar challenges faced in 2020, we cannot be more excited about the opportunity to again deliver on our long-term shareholder value proposition. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And then we will take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Congrats on just a great 2020. For the quarter, 4Q 2020 gross margins were a bit below despite big companion animal growth. And next year it seems like you're guiding to flattish, call it, gross margins again, despite what seems like positive mix shifts. So, Glenn, can you talk about that a bit? Why are we not seeing a bit more in gross margin considering the companion animal performance? And is expanding gross margin still a part of the long-term story? And then I'll stick with sort of guidance. Just really big hummers on 2021 guidance out of the gate. You talked about livestock versus companion. Can you talk through the components of companion animal a little bit more? I don't know if I specifically heard a Trio number, but is it safe to assume Trio of $400 million plus in any other components you\u2019d call out? Thanks, guys.\nGlenn David: Sure, Jon. So firstly, you look at the gross margin expectation for 2021. It is relatively flat versus 2020. As you mentioned, the mix with companion animal will be beneficial as we move into 2021. Some of the offsets to that, there were some of the investments that we're making in other areas such as reference labs, which come at a lower margin, particularly in the early stage of their life cycle is we're building those labs, [indiscernible] the margins will be a little lower until they reach their full operating scale. So that's some of the offsets. So there are some positives in terms of the companion animal mix. Some offsets there with some of the longer terms we\u2019re investing and making in other areas. In terms of the drivers of companion animal growth, so obviously we do expect Trio to be a significant driver of growth for 2021. We're not putting a specific number on Trio, but we would expect the contribution from growth in 2021 to be at least as big as what we achieved in 2020. So that'll obviously be one of the drivers, also continued growth in our dermatology portfolio. We saw very strong performance in 2020 with 23% growth in that portfolio operationally for the year. We do expect that portfolio will exceed $1 billion as we move into 2021. Also in companion animal diagnostics, we expect very rapid growth in diagnostics as well. In the fourth quarter, we saw 20% growth and we expect that will help carry us forward with the strong momentum that we had in the quarter into 2021, as well as strong performance that we're seeing in many of our emerging markets, such as China and Brazil. So those are some of the factors that are driving the strong companion animal growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, thanks, guys. I'm going to ask a quick two-parter. First one is going to be on the livestock market, and just specifically on Draxxin. Are you starting to see some competition? I know the patent has just rolled off, but any early comments you can tell us in terms of pricing from competing launches and sort of [indiscernible] expectation of the market share? But also what steps you are taking? And how meaningful the headwind do you expect in 2021? And then broader on livestock, we've read a lot about input costs going higher on corn, things of that potentially pressuring producers in some markets, poultry and swine. How does that factor into your outlook for a low single digit growth? And then a second question would be just a little bit more on the companion animal expectations for 2021. I mean, obviously, you're growing well above the market, but any thoughts on sort of in line portfolio? And you commented on Trio, and you commented on strong derm strength, and that you see in Librela. But just can you sort of comment on Revolution Plus and on the rest of the in line portfolio there?\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Mike. So starting on Draxxin, we are expecting a number of competitors to enter in the U.S. market. Again, the LOE is this month, so it hasn't happened yet. I would say more probably entrants than we expected a few months ago, but we don't think that will last. Obviously, I think the market will shake out obviously to a few. As we said previously, typically, we expect about - to lose about 20% to 40% share over several years. In the case of Draxxin, given the large number of competitors, we do expect that to be factor, but we don't really expect it to be overall different. And really partly what drives that I think is we do believe that a lower price on Draxxin will expand the market for macrolides overall, and therefore the market itself will grow. We also think we're positioned well from a broad portfolio, strong technical. We do expect that the price to come down in that 20% to 40% that is an expectation. But as we said, this is all baked in right now to our guidance, so the expectation around where Draxxin is going to be is there. And if you look at broader livestock, you referenced some of the [info] [ph] costs. As you heard in some of our opening remarks, we are expecting low single digit growth, so a return to growth in livestock overall. And some of that will be led in the U.S. [indiscernible] a lot of that will be led outside the U.S. As a reminder, about 60% of our livestock business is outside of the U.S. and we're seeing incredible growth right now in China and some other markets, Brazil, et cetera. So overall, we do think some of the [info] [ph] costs in U.S. will be a pressure, but we have, given the diversity of our portfolio, looking at some large markets, our second largest market is China, our third largest market is Brazil, we do see strength in livestock there. So we overall do believe livestock will return to low single digit growth in 2021. And we continue to believe it will return to normal growth in the mid single digit range 4% to 6% over the medium term. So, Glenn, I'm not sure if you want to take the incremental question on the broad companion animal trends in 2021.\nGlenn David: Yes. So the trends for companion animal will remain very strong. It's really driven by the breadth of our portfolio. So we talked a lot about the growth that we expect to see from Trio from our derm portfolio, from our diagnostics portfolio. Also in 2021, we'll have the launch of our monoclonal antibodies for pain in Europe, as well as some other markets. We\u2019ll also be a key contributor to growth. But then there are other products that round out the portfolio; products such as ProHeart 12, products such as Revolution Plus. Also the growth that we're seeing in markets like China, where companion animal is growing very rapidly, markets like Brazil. So there are really many areas of growth that we see. And that's driven by the fact and we do have the broadest portfolio in companion animal. We're able to leverage that with our customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So what are the macro factors that you see for Zoetis in 2021, as it pertains to livestock feed prices, weather, any other headwinds or tailwinds that you see out there? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure, Louise. Good to hear from you. As you look at livestock overall, we're seeing some of the macro trends as sort of a recovery in China around AFS is driving significant portion of the growth from a swine perspective. China is still going to be importing a decent amount probably less than in 2020 from other markets around the world sort of maintaining that. We're also hopeful that you'll see an increase in dine out, which will send a signal to the industry to expand herds. So I mean 2020 was obviously hit with many different factors, but we do see both an increase in demand. And in markets where our technologies have really leveraged some of the emerging markets, we're seeing significant uptick there. There will remain challenges in some of the U.S. producers, obviously, for some of the [info] [ph] costs, et cetera, but we do believe you'll see more of a return to normalcy as we move into 2021. And that's why we were guiding at sort of the low single digit, but we do believe in the medium-term, we'll be back to sort of a mid single digit overall.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Thanks. I'm curious how the multi-formulation approach towards parasiticide is resonating across your customer base. I guess this is [indiscernible] you haven't had any strength historically [indiscernible] cannibalization of legacy products there playing out in line with your expectations? And then my second question is on the new pain meds. How should we think about the contributions from them this year in Europe or other countries, will be meaningful at all? And how should we think about the dynamics that are impacting approval in the U.S.? Do you still anticipate? Are you still confident that these will be blockbuster products for you with the launch in the U.S. in 2022?\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Erin. I heard the second question on labs, which I can answer. You were breaking up in digitizing on the first question. I think we more or less have it, so let us give a shot, and you can comment if we missed out some of what we heard. So starting on your second question on the labs, we were very excited to now have Librela approved and launching in the first half of this year in the EU, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland. And Solensia, we continue to expect approval in the EU in the first half of this year and to be launching sort of mid-year. We already do have approval on Solensia in Switzerland. And we remain confident in the eventual approval based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted in the U.S. But if you saw in our remarks and our release, the approval timeline has moved out a bit. We believe this has to do with the fact that this is the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA in animal health. Our previous one Cytopoint was actually USDA. It's making it a little harder for us honestly to predict some of the regulatory process. We're continuing to work through the regulatory process and manufacturing inspections, and we'll continue to keep you updated. We don't think that changes the overall peak sales of this product at all, but it is a slightly different process. And I guess, Glenn, might have understood a little bit better, but we'll try your first question. I know we missed it.\nGlenn David: Yes. So, Erin, I think your question was around how we're performing with the breadth of our portfolio from parasiticide with our customers. And I think that's going very well in the veterinary clinics. We're really able to offer our customers a variety of options based on how they want to best treat the animals. And I think that shows in the performance that we saw on the Simparica franchise in 2020. Not only did we exceed our goals for Trio with $170 million in sales in the year, but we also saw significant growth in Simparica, which really exceeded our expectations. So we grew operationally 16% with Simparica. What we saw was that the advertising and driving patients into the clinic for Simparica Trio actually benefited the overall portfolio. We also saw a very positive growth in ProHeart 12 as well. So we think the breadth of the portfolio and the parasiticides was really a benefit and our field colleagues really able to execute very well with that portfolio.\nKristin Peck: Was that your question? Did we get it all? All right, you can come back in the queue. We missed you, sorry about that and look a little bit digital.\nOperator: Okay. We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kreger: Hi, thanks very much. Just maybe a quick follow-up on the Librela and Solensia timeline in the U.S. Do you have a sense for how far pushed back the approval of timing might be? And do you think you need to collect additional clinical data?\nKristin Peck: Yes. We don't have a great sense right now. We're still working through the regulatory and manufacturing process. We also \u2013 the FDA is going to require inspections. Our facilities are outside the U.S. So the exact timing of when they're going to be able to do that is a little bit uncertain. So I don't have a great sense. If we did, we would have obviously given more specific guidance. We do not expect it to be in 2021, which is what we're being fair right now. And as soon as we know more, we'll be happy to update in future calls going forward, but unfortunately I don't have greater \u2013 again, we remain very confident that it will eventually be approved. But we need to go through a new process with a regular that hasn't an animal health under CBM approved in monoclonal antibodies previously. So it's a little bit different for us. So this is the best we know at this point.\nJohn Kreger: Great. Thank you. And then a second question. Can you maybe just sort of frame the diagnostics plan for 2021? It seems like results are starting to accelerate there. Are any of the investments being focused in the livestock? Should we really think about your efforts right now being concentrated with companion animal?\nKristin Peck: Sure. For 2021, our focus remains on companion animals. We're very pleased with our progress on placements, which is a really good leading indicator of usage. As you saw, we had double-digit consumable growth as well, which we're quite pleased with. As we look at new products, we've added the Imagyst platform. We're excited with its first indication, obviously in fecal, that's the AI-powered one. We're looking for additional indications there. So the last piece there would also be reference labs. So we're continuing to expand our U.S. reference lab. So we\u2019re probably adding about three to five more labs this year. So we believe diagnostics is a core part of our portfolio. It's a market that grows at 10%, but we're really pleased that we're starting to see some strong momentum across the different parts of it. So both reference lab as well as placements as well as consumables. So we remain very committed to the space and are pleased with our progress over there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on a great year. Can you give us a little bit of flavor on where Trio is taking share from? I think you mentioned there's some new to the category, but I'm just kind of trying to get a flavor is it legacy \u2013 just legacy flea and tick? I mean, what component is heartworm? And basically, what I'm trying to do is get a good sense of how big this can grow in terms of both the heartworm market and the flea and tick market? And then just a second related question on Trio. Is there any synergies, particularly on the sales synergy from the direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns, you might be able to benefit maybe derm or maybe even there's a cost synergy? So thank you very much.\nKristin Peck: Sure. So starting on the Trio, we did see an increase in share in Q4 of 7%. So we are taking share in a number of places that's coming from. If you think about it, the first is new poppies, where I think we're doing quite well with new I think poppies. Also new people to the category overall, I would say, people who maybe previously had gotten products over the counter are moving in. And we are taking share from some of the other established competitors in this space. So I think we're seeing strong growth overall, I would say there and pleased at our share. If you look at the potential for the product, the two competitors NexGard and Prosecco are each $600 million products a day. So we continue to believe there's significant growth. We remain under index to be honest with you in parasiticide. So we continue to see this as a significant part of our overall growth From a sense \u2013 are there synergies with derm? Not really is what I would say, except for on a cost side. Obviously, we can get better buying power when you replace DTCs by leveraging the spend across both. But beyond that, we don't see strong synergies honestly between the DTC on one affecting the other, unless our clinic has to carry bolts and things like that, but we think maybe the only synergy there is just in our buying power by leveraging the combined DTC sense.\nOperator: Now we can go to our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Kristin, maybe to start, what do you think the launch curve looks like for products like Librela and Solensia? Obviously, a new way for vets that treat osteoarthritis and chronic pain. I guess kind of what are your initial kind of impressions on sort of the level of demand that's out there from vets for this type of treatment? And how will Librela be priced relative to existing treatments on the market? I know it can be kind of up to $100 a month here in the U.S. I'm sure it varies a lot by market, but just any comment on pricing would be helpful.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I think the lifecycle for Librela and Solensia in the curve will be a slightly different. Librela is entering a market that's $400 million today. So it's an established market. So I think the ability for \u2013 people are already bringing their dogs in for OA pain. So I think we have the opportunity with Librela to expand the number of patients given the safety and efficacy profile and the compliance benefits of the product. I think we can also increase days on therapy. So it also helps us to grow the market and then obviously price to your point. So it is priced at a premium to many of the products on the market today. It is not \u2013 obviously, we don't have a price in the U.S. since we don't even have an approval yet in the U.S. I think Solensia is going to be a little bit different because the curve is going to take a little longer. And that has to do the fact that there really isn't a market today in most parts of the world. If you had a cat, there really was no treatment, so cat owners have kind of been condition to not bring their cats in. We've started focusing, about a year ago to try to build that market, make pet owners aware what OA pain looks like in cats and get \u2013 encourage them to start bringing their cats to the vet, and then getting vets to treat that. We think it's a significant market, but you have to first medicalize some of these conditions and treat it. It's significant. There's 60 million cats in the us U.S. And really only \u2013 but 40% of them have away, but only 18% of them are really identified by that. So we think both are significant markets that we can grow the market. So Solensia is more about creating a market. And I think you can look at our success in doing that with dermatology with Apoquel and Cytopoint. So we're investing early as Glenn has been talking about some of the guidance over the last year and for 2021 and building those markets. But I would assume the curves of Librela will be much faster than the curves of Solensia as we're building a market.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi. Good morning and congratulations on the results. A couple of questions from me. Firstly, since livestock recovery this year seems to be so contingent on China. And there are news of regulatory of illegal vaccines being used and the recurrence of ACF. So I want to understand what you're seeing on the ground and how should we have our heads around the re-hurting cycling in 2021? Second on operating margins, considering that you will not have the dilutive impact of diagnosis that we saw in 2020. Should we be looking for better operating margins considering that revenue mix is better? Livestock should be in a recovery? And if so, what are the offsets to this. Thanks.\nGlenn David: Sure. So when you look at overall livestock, and particularly in China, so we've seen very positive performance in livestock in China this year. So from a livestock perspective, we grew 45% in China this year and we expect continued strong performance in China in 2021 as we continue to see the herd rebuild, recovery from African swine fever. And where we're seeing that recovery is particularly in our larger accounts and the larger accounts use more of the multinational products than our premium products. So we've seen a really rapid acceleration of our growth, for example, in the second half of the year in swine in particular in 2020, we grew over 100% in swine in China. And we expect very positive momentum moving into 2021 and very significant growth from China in 2021. In terms of the operating margins, there are a couple of things to look at as we move into 2021. A, number of areas of investments that we have in our SG&A, really continuing to support the growth of Trio as well as the monoclonal antibodies for pain as well as dermatology. We've increased our DTC investment in 2020, particularly around Trio and derm, and we plan on continuing that in 2021, as we saw very positive return on investment there. Obviously, we'll continue to invest in R&D. And that'll be an area of continued investment as we've seen a very positive return on that investment as well. The other thing to consider when you look at the overall guidance, which \u2013 with revenue growing 9% to 11% and income growing 9% to 12%; one of the reasons that income isn't growing more rapidly is the change in assumption in tax rate between 2020 and 2021. In 2020, our rate was 18.3%. Our guidance for 2021 is approximately 20%. If you neutralize for the impact of the tax rate, our adjusted net income would actually be growing 2% faster, so more 11% to 14%. So we are seeing margin expansion, but the impact of the tax rate is diluting that to some degree.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Can you talk, first, maybe a bit about innovation on the livestock side? It seems like the market between COVID and similar dynamics has been kind of a bit lackluster in terms of growth the last few years. So what does it take to get back to mid single digit growth on the livestock side? And what are some of the bigger innovation trends we should be watching there? And then a second question was just following up on the topic of margins. As we start looking after 2022 and beyond, should we be thinking about a sustained window of higher expense growth as you get many of these new launches off the ground? Or as a lot of that groundwork already been, I guess, invested as we go into 2020 and 2021? I'm trying to get a sense of how we should think about longer-term margin expansion dynamics, assuming we continue this very healthy top line set up that seems to be playing out. Thanks so much.\nKristin Peck: Thanks Chris. We have been talking about the fact that to really get to the mid-single digits in a sustainable way. You're going to need innovation. I think there are few spaces where you're already starting to see that and some that will be coming. The first is around the vector vaccine space, which we have been talking about. In 2020, we launched our first one in the U.S. for Newcastle. In 2021, we launched one for IBV. We're looking for more launches there. This is a significant market, it\u2019s about a $300 million market growing double digit. So we do see vector technology and poultry, which is one of the faster growing, species being an area of innovation and growth for us. We also think more broadly that immunotherapies are going to be really important for two reasons. One, there are alternatives to antibiotics and secondly, healthier animals are more productive. So it also increases productivity for producers. So I think immunotherapies, which we've been working on for a while and have a partnership with Colorado state to develop will be important. The other sector that I think is really important to focus on is precision livestock farming which we also think has great potential. We're leaders right now in the genetic space there and genetic testing, we also purchased PLA as you know, we're looking at really back-to-back individual animal care and herd monitoring and I think that's probably the next big wave, that's probably more of a medium-term growth driver, but I think there's a number of spaces where you're going to see innovation at the livestock, across vectors, immunotherapies, and precision livestock farming. I'll let Glenn take the second question on long-term margin expansion.\nGlenn David: Yes. So in terms of the long-term margin expenses, there are a couple of factors to consider. So for 2021, we mentioned that the gross margin is relatively flat and talked about some of the drivers of that with some of the investments we're making in reference labs, also the impact of the Draxxin LOE this year on gross margin. So as we move into the 2022 and beyond some of those impacts will be a little less than we would expect to see continued expansion in gross margin. In terms of the overall operating expenses, beyond 2021, obviously there will be one-year where T&E normalizes, when things get back to normal from COVID, but beyond that impact, we would expect that we would continue to be able to grow our expenses at a pace below that of revenue. So we'll probably continue to grow R&D in line with revenue. That may vary any given year based on the opportunities, but SG&A based on the infrastructure that we have globally established, we should be able to grow that somewhere between inflation and revenue. So we would expect to continue to see expansion there on an overall operating margin perspective.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. And let me add my congrats on another phenomenal year as well. So I have two questions first with respect to the monoclonal antibody approval delays. So it's for both cats and dogs, but it wasn't quite clear to me whether the FDA wants more clinical data or whether there are manufacturing issues because \u2013 manufacturing questions, because I think Kristin, you had mentioned manufacturing. So if you could just clarify on both of them what the FDA issues are, whether they're clinical or manufacturing? And then second. , Zoetis\u2019s R&D has obviously been amazingly differentiated from competitors, struggled to bring blockbuster companion animal products to market, even including follow-ons to Zoetis\u2019s top growth drivers over several years. And so considering that, can you just help us understand the unique aspects in Zoetis\u2019s R&D and its ability to maintain separation from the competition? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks David. With regards to the monoclonal antibodies Librela and Solensia, it really is just working through the regulatory process and the questions that they're asking and they're requiring inspections of site. So at this point we have not been asked for any clinical data, but we're still in the regulatory process is what I was saying. It is the first time doing that with the FDA, so it's just a new process for both. Understandably it's the first time they're looking at some of these types of products, so they have a number of questions. So it really is just going through the regulatory review process and trying to manage new manufacturing inspections, which I do know probably the COVID is definitely affecting that a little bit, but we're just working through that. So at this point, we have not been asked for any additional clinical data and we don't think there's any manufacturing issue at this point. We're just still working through the review process and what their expectations are. With regards to Zoetis R&D, you know what I was saying is, I think it's the partnership between R&D, manufacturing and our commercial organization. It's taking those insights to the commercial as customer needs and partnering early on with R&D to develop products. I think the other thing we've done really well is partner with manufacturing to be able to scale those products and be able to bring them to market. We manufacture own monoclonal antibodies. As you know we've got very strong manufacturing capability, which is I think important for launching many of the products and scaling up at the level. We certainly learned the hard way early on in our journey about investing in that partnership, when we thought some of the challenges we had got supplying Apoquel. So I think from an R&D perspective, obviously I think we have great scientists, but I think it's the rigorous though process and partnership they have with our commercial and our manufacturing colleagues and our willingness to invest in disruptive technologies and take those risks that we've been doing. We've been managing over the last eight years. Anything you would add there Glenn?\nGlenn David: I think it's exactly what you said, Kristin. We talked about the inter-connect capabilities between commercial manufacturing and R&D. And I think that works extremely well here. Like Kristin said, identifying what the key needs are in the marketplace, early on coming up with solutions and making sure that the products that we're able to manufacture and we've been very successful in doing that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nKathy Miner: Good morning. Thank you. First question I have is relates again to the monoclonals. Can you just clarify when you talked about plant at-site inspections being needed is it correct then that both either one or both of the monoclonals are manufactured outside of the U.S.? The second question also on the products. Is the intention to launch both the cat and dog ones at the same time, is there an advantage to doing one or the other and we can speak just about the EU markets, where you have approval. And the second question on the derm products, you've targeted 1 billion in sales for this year. Can you talk about some of the drivers behind that? Is it outside of the U.S.? Is it more , et cetera? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. So first of all Kathy, great to hear from you. Secondly, on the math they are both the manufacturing facilities are different for them, but they are outside the U.S. And prior approval inspections, regulator can handle them differently, but they are going to be required probably for both of these products and they are both different, but they're both outside of the U.S. And I think your second question was around the derm sales growth in U.S. or ex-U.S. We still believe we're under penetrated outside the U.S. There\u2019s the same number of dogs in the U.S. and outside of U.S. gets two-thirds of our sales in derm remain in the U.S. So we do there\u2019s significant opportunity. It has been hard to get scale outside the U.S., historically mostly because we have been now able do direct-to-consumer advertising, that is brand specific. One of the investments we are going to make for the first time is doing just overall disease awareness in direct-to-consumer advertising in 2021. So we cannot be specific with brands, but in derm, we really are the only products. So hopefully if you raise awareness around a disease and that there are treatments you can encourage people to speak to their vet and get the best care. So that I think is one of the reasons why International, we are hoping will start to grow faster, but I have to give our U.S. team tremendous credit and they continue to grow the market. The investment in direct-to-consumer advertising, raising awareness to our products are bringing more pets in and getting more pets treated in. In the U.S., there are still 6 million dogs, who need our products or need a derm solution who aren't getting one. So we do believe there's still growth in the U.S., although we would expect, though I'm sure I know last years, we've seen very strong growth out of the U.S., we would expect over time for the U S growth start to decline the overall growth and more of the growth to come from international, but we still believe there's significant potential in both.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nElliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. And congratulations on the strong performance of Trio in a challenging year. Kristin, just maybe want to dive in a little bit more on the launch details around the product. Seems like obviously one of the reasons for its relative success this year versus earlier expectations was just more or less cannibalization of Simparica than originally expected. But wondering if you could just share with those additional metrics in terms of where you are with respect to clinic penetration rates? How many targeted clinics have you been able to actually reach, just additional metrics around the uptake in launch would be helpful? Then just thinking about the product longer term, obviously very strong first year. Well, if I think about launching the logs on the human health side, I mean generally five years out, you're looking at something on the order of 6X to 10X, first year sales, not sure if that's applicable in the companion animal market, but just some thoughts in terms of maybe longer term launch analogs with respect to the product? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. With regards to the launch of Trio. I would say there's a lot of unique characteristics of the Trio launch. A, we launched at the height of the pandemic in the U.S. So I'm not sure how to compare that to other people's launches. We were slower to penetrate clinics, I would say in Q2 and Q3, but we're quite pleased that by the end of the year we reached all of our penetration goals. So I think our penetration has been quite strong, given the delay really the outperformance was our share once we were penetrated within the clinic, the ability to get more of the patients on our product has been really strong. And that gives us good confidence as we move into 2021. As Glenn mentioned a few minutes earlier, we are expecting a similar contribution. For starters, we'll have a Q1 where we didn't have sales last year, but with the penetration we were able to achieve by the end of the year, which is reaching the goals we had wanted. We think that we can just get the same pull through that we had at those clinics in 2021, we'll continue to see a great growth across with them there. We're also seeing it also pull our broader parasiticide portfolio. So I'm not sure I would say \u2013 I would use a human health analog, but I continue to remind everybody works. We remain under-penetrated in this space. And the herd is the single biggest category in the animal health space, it's $4 billion globally with $2.5 billion in the U.S. Continuing to see about 15% growth in Simparica beyond Trio, globally, it shows that there's significant opportunity here for us to continue to grow. And we were quite pleased if you looked at overall care, we had an increase in share of 7% in Q4. So we think we can continue to take share on this and grow it overall. So I'm not sure it looks like human health. But with our biggest competitors already being $600 million products. I think we've got strong ability to continue to grow as get at least our fair share in this space.\nGlenn David: Yes. And the only thing, I have to add in terms of the question on peak sales. What becomes challenging with peak sales is the timing of competition and that remains unknown. Obviously for 2021, our current guidance does not expect another triple combo within the U.S. and the timing of that will obviously impact what our overall peak sales could be for the product.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.\nSriker Nadipuram: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, this is Sriker Nadipuram on for Navin Jacob, I just have a couple of specific questions. Can you quantify that revenue impact in 2020 of the earlier fall cattle run? And do you expect this to recur \u2013 this adverse negative revenue impact you expect this to recur in 2021? And then can you quantify the difference in gross margin in diagnostics from your therapeutics portfolio or your corporate average? Thanks very much.\nGlenn David: Yes. So in terms of the impact of the early fall cattle run for 2020, that did not have an impact for the year that was just the seasonal impact between Q3 and Q4. I think you saw the very strong performance in Q3, you saw the opposite occur in Q4 of this year, and then predicting seasonality of that in 2021 obviously is difficult, but we focus more on the full year obviously in terms of the overall impact. In terms of gross margin for the diagnostic business, we don't specifically provide gross margins by therapeutic area or by species. But overall we always say our companion animal business obviously has the higher margin, diagnostics in general is lower than some of our key therapeutic areas.\nOperator: And our next question will come from David Steinberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Steinberg: Thanks. I have two questions. [indiscernible] one of the tailwinds from the pandemic, the increased adoptions around the country, around the world and in previous comments, I think you said there were about 3.2 million adoptions annual. I was just curious, now that 2020 is in the books, do you have any data, how many more adoptions there were last year? And the other tailwind, you've called out is just the increase in dollars per visit. And as most pet owners get vaccinated, they go back to work, how durable do you think both the increased dollars per visit and increased adoptions are. And is there any chance that could reverse when those people are back to the office? And a final question Trio, potential Trio competition, I think Glenn you said no expectations for competition this year, you previously said no competition in the first half of this your, when do you actually, I know it's murky, but when do you actually think there might be your first competitor and also what gives you such great confidence that there would not be any competition in 2021, I simply asked that because it was such a successful launch , it's obviously a target for competitors? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. with regards to pet adoption, there are 135 million pets in the U.S. In a typical year, you see about 3.2 million adoptions. So even a 10% increase in that isn't going to dramatically change things, but we are seeing an increase in vet visits which we think is a positive trend. And we do expect that to continue in 2021. So as Glenn mentioned earlier, we did see a 2% increase in vet visits in Q4. We are expecting that to continue. So I think you are seeing maybe a proportional to what were the incremental pets that were adopted. We don't have very specific numbers, but, I would say assume it's somewhere between like 2% and 10% there, it'll be helpful. And I do think we're going to continue to see an increase in visits. You asked us well about spend per visit, which was incredibly strong in 2020. We don't believe it's going to remain that strong to be honest with you. We still think it will grow. If you look generally speaking at our space, we've seen overall revenues of clinics growing in the mid-to-high single digits on normal year. I'm not sure what 2021 is going to look like, but assuming it's somewhere close to a normal year, we do think you're going to see strong growth overall there in spend, overall revenue in the vet clinic, both with growth in total number of visits, as well as a spend per visit. With regards to the trio questions on competition. We don't have the visibility that human health has as to when we'll get competitors. To be very frank, we would have expected a competitor by now. We would have expected one in derm as well. So we're not exactly sure what the challenge is, but we don't have a great way of knowing other than rumor mill in the market and strategic accounts who often try to renegotiate with us when they think a competitor is entering the market, which we haven't seen yet, that does not mean that, someone couldn't surprise us. So there could be, but we want it to be clear what our guidance was based on. So at this point, given we don't have any specific knowledge, we will assume we do not have competition in 2021. And as to when they would come, honestly we don't really know, but to your point, these are large markets, both your question on Trio but as well as derm and we are expecting competition. We just at this point do not have any specific knowledge. So our guidance did not include an assumption for competition in either space. Our next question from Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nGregg Gilbert: Hi, going back to the diagnostics field. Glenn, you mentioned a growth rate there, I think 20% plus. Can you talk about to what degree that rate is influenced by M&A, if at all? and maybe more broadly about your strategy there? Clearly there's an element of sort of building and catching up, but I'm also curious on sort of how you're trying to differentiate or leapfrog competition broadly from a diagnostic standpoint? And then Glenn, are you seeing any signs of upward pressure on key input costs? As the world thinks about commodity price inflation or at least the potential for it? Thanks.\nGlenn David: So in terms of the diagnostics growth for the quarter, like you said we did see a 20% growth in diagnostics. A part of that was driven by the reference lab acquisitions that we had. So net of that organic growth was around 12% to 13% in diagnostics for the quarter. So still very positive growth in the quarter. We saw a nice momentum as we move throughout the year, and we think that'll carry us well into 2021. Also, we established a much better infrastructure for diagnostics in 2020 in two ways. A, we fully integrated into our core SAP system in the diagnostics business. So we now are able to provide one phase to our customer in terms of billing as well as product offerings. The other thing that we did was we made significant improvements in our bi-directional connectivity, improving significantly throughout the year. At the beginning of the year, we had that connectivity to about 30%. We increased that at the end of the year to over 70%. So we think that establishes very well as we\u2019re moving to 2021, as well as some of the new innovation we're bringing with the images platform as well. So we think those are some of the key drivers as we move into 2021, as well as the continued reference lab expansion that we're embarking on. So we're very excited about the growth that we expect to see in diagnostics in 2021. In terms of key input costs and inflation for us from a manufacturing perspective, there's nothing in particular that we see particularly challenging. Obviously for 2020, we had some elevated freight costs because of the impact of COVID-19 that will probably continue as we move into 2021 that is embedded in our guidance, but nothing else of a significant impact.\nOperator: There appears to be no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Thank you. Thanks everybody for your questions and your continued interest in the Zoetis today. We look forward to keeping you updated on our business throughout the year and continuing to deliver the results and innovations that you and our customers expect. Thanks so much for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy. As we all know, we're still experiencing hard times in many regions, as COVID cases continue and new variants of the virus emerge. But I hope you share my optimism that with progress in vaccinations and continued adherence to safety protocols, better days are ahead. The year 2020 will be remembered for COVID-19, but for Zoetis it also reaffirms the resilience of our business, the essential nature of animal health and the agility and dedication of our colleagues in the face of industry and personal challenges. Throughout the year, we successfully ensured colleagues' safety and maintained reliable supply for our customers. We kept driving innovation and strengthening our diverse portfolio of 13 blockbusters and more than 300 product lines across eight species and seven major product categories. We successfully launched our triple combination parasiticide Simparica Trio. We also achieved approvals for the first ever long acting monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, with Librela's authorization for dogs in the European Union and several other markets, and Solensia's first authorization for cats in Switzerland. We also continue to build on our vaccine portfolio in livestock with the approval of our CircoMax [Myco] [ph] swine vaccine in the European Union. And in poultry, we continued advancing our recombinant vector vaccine with the approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT-IBD in the U.S. Meanwhile, in diagnostics, we successfully launched Vetscan Imagyst, our breakthrough platform using cloud-based artificial intelligence for veterinary clinics. We were able to do all this while staying anchored to our purpose, and advancing the five long-term priorities that I set out at the beginning of the year, including sustainability, where we made important progress in our ESG programs and metrics reporting. We look forward to sharing our long-term ESG goals in the coming weeks. And finally, we delivered financial results for 2020 that were in line with the guidance we provided last February before the impact of the global pandemic was known. For the full year, we generated 9% operational growth in revenue, primarily based on new products in our companion animal business, the continued strength of our key dermatology portfolio and growth in China. And as part of our long-term value proposition, we once again grew revenues faster than the anticipated growth for 2020 and faster than the historical industry rates of 4% to 6%. As part of our value proposition, we also delivered on growing our adjusted net income faster than revenue. For the full year, we delivered operational growth of 10% in adjusted net income while adapting our operations within pandemic, and continuing investments in our pipeline and new product launches. We generated strong fourth quarter results, which Glenn will discuss in a minute. And these performance trends give us confidence in our growth drivers and strong momentum for 2021. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in 2021, driven by ongoing strength in pet care, continued expansion in markets outside the U.S., most notably China, and acceleration of our diagnostics portfolio penetration. We are guiding to operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue for full year 2021. Growth expectations for the companion animal market are in the mid single digits. And we expect [indiscernible] to grow significantly faster than that based on the continued uptake of Simparica Trio, the strength of our key dermatology portfolio and the launch of monoclonal antibodies in markets outside the U.S. Positive pet care trends during the pandemic based on increased adoptions and people spending more time with their pets should continue driving market growth in the near-term. Data in the U.S. shows visits to veterinary clinics have rebounded and the average revenue per visit has continued to increase. Over the long-term, we see these trends moderating as adoption rates normalize and people eventually returned to the workplace. The specialty care regimen and chronic care treatment that began in the pandemic should continue, and our innovative portfolio across dermatology, parasiticide, pain, vaccines and diagnostics have us well positioned for continued growth [impacting] [ph] share as we shift the curve. In terms of livestock market, we expect low single digit market growth in 2021, as the impact from COVID-19 will still be felt as a number of products experienced loss of exclusivity. We expect the [indiscernible] to grow in line with the market, even as we face increased headwinds from generic competition for Draxxin, our leading anti-infective product. We are confident we can leverage our lifecycle innovation strategies together with the overall diversity of our livestock portfolio, including swine product sales in China, to help us address the loss of exclusivity for Draxxin and maintain livestock growth that will support our 2021 guidance. Longer-term, we will continue to invest in livestock innovations and data-driven animal agricultural solutions. As we continue through 2021, we will be building on the progress against our five priorities; driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high-performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. Our investment plans and focus on growth for 2021 include continuing the successful launch of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and other markets, as well as the ongoing adoption of other new parasiticide, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12. Driving growth in dermatology through increased use of direct-to-consumer advertising and disease awareness campaigns in the U.S. and globally. Our focus remains on growing this market and increasing customer loyalty to our innovative treatments, which we expect to help us top $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. As noted earlier, we'll be investing in the launch of the first monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in Europe in the first half of 2021, and advancing the regulatory process in the U.S. and other markets. While we remain confident in the eventual U.S. approval of these products based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted, at this point, we believe it is unlikely we will receive approvals for Solensia or Librela in the U.S. in 2021. We continue to work through regulatory reviews and manufacturing inspections with the FDA, and we will continue to keep you updated on this process on future calls. And finally, we're continuing our development of digital and data solutions that will support more individualized animal care and more efficient and sustainable operations for producers. In conclusion, I'm incredibly proud of what our people accomplished in the face of such uncertainty during 2020, and it gives me great confidence in our continued success and full year guidance for 2021. As we navigate through recovery from the global pandemic and capitalize on the growth opportunities we see ahead, but optimism comes from what drove us over the last year. The resilience and essential nature of the animal health industry, the diversity, innovation, and market leadership of our portfolio, and the agility and passion of our colleagues to face any challenge. Now, let me hand it off to Glenn, who will speak more about our fourth quarter results and guidance for the full year 2021. Thanks, Mike. So starting on Draxxin, we are expecting a number of competitors to enter in the U.S. market. Again, the LOE is this month, so it hasn't happened yet. I would say more probably entrants than we expected a few months ago, but we don't think that will last. Obviously, I think the market will shake out obviously to a few. As we said previously, typically, we expect about - to lose about 20% to 40% share over several years. In the case of Draxxin, given the large number of competitors, we do expect that to be factor, but we don't really expect it to be overall different. And really partly what drives that I think is we do believe that a lower price on Draxxin will expand the market for macrolides overall, and therefore the market itself will grow. We also think we're positioned well from a broad portfolio, strong technical. We do expect that the price to come down in that 20% to 40% that is an expectation. But as we said, this is all baked in right now to our guidance, so the expectation around where Draxxin is going to be is there. And if you look at broader livestock, you referenced some of the [info] [ph] costs. As you heard in some of our opening remarks, we are expecting low single digit growth, so a return to growth in livestock overall. And some of that will be led in the U.S. [indiscernible] a lot of that will be led outside the U.S. As a reminder, about 60% of our livestock business is outside of the U.S. and we're seeing incredible growth right now in China and some other markets, Brazil, et cetera. So overall, we do think some of the [info] [ph] costs in U.S. will be a pressure, but we have, given the diversity of our portfolio, looking at some large markets, our second largest market is China, our third largest market is Brazil, we do see strength in livestock there. So we overall do believe livestock will return to low single digit growth in 2021. And we continue to believe it will return to normal growth in the mid single digit range 4% to 6% over the medium term. So, Glenn, I'm not sure if you want to take the incremental question on the broad companion animal trends in 2021. Sure, Louise. Good to hear from you. As you look at livestock overall, we're seeing some of the macro trends as sort of a recovery in China around AFS is driving significant portion of the growth from a swine perspective. China is still going to be importing a decent amount probably less than in 2020 from other markets around the world sort of maintaining that. We're also hopeful that you'll see an increase in dine out, which will send a signal to the industry to expand herds. So I mean 2020 was obviously hit with many different factors, but we do see both an increase in demand. And in markets where our technologies have really leveraged some of the emerging markets, we're seeing significant uptick there. There will remain challenges in some of the U.S. producers, obviously, for some of the [info] [ph] costs, et cetera, but we do believe you'll see more of a return to normalcy as we move into 2021. And that's why we were guiding at sort of the low single digit, but we do believe in the medium-term, we'll be back to sort of a mid single digit overall. Thanks, Erin. I heard the second question on labs, which I can answer. You were breaking up in digitizing on the first question. I think we more or less have it, so let us give a shot, and you can comment if we missed out some of what we heard. So starting on your second question on the labs, we were very excited to now have Librela approved and launching in the first half of this year in the EU, Brazil, Canada and Switzerland. And Solensia, we continue to expect approval in the EU in the first half of this year and to be launching sort of mid-year. We already do have approval on Solensia in Switzerland. And we remain confident in the eventual approval based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted in the U.S. But if you saw in our remarks and our release, the approval timeline has moved out a bit. We believe this has to do with the fact that this is the first monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA in animal health. Our previous one Cytopoint was actually USDA. It's making it a little harder for us honestly to predict some of the regulatory process. We're continuing to work through the regulatory process and manufacturing inspections, and we'll continue to keep you updated. We don't think that changes the overall peak sales of this product at all, but it is a slightly different process. And I guess, Glenn, might have understood a little bit better, but we'll try your first question. I know we missed it. Was that your question? Did we get it all? All right, you can come back in the queue. We missed you, sorry about that and look a little bit digital. Yes. We don't have a great sense right now. We're still working through the regulatory and manufacturing process. We also \u2013 the FDA is going to require inspections. Our facilities are outside the U.S. So the exact timing of when they're going to be able to do that is a little bit uncertain. So I don't have a great sense. If we did, we would have obviously given more specific guidance. We do not expect it to be in 2021, which is what we're being fair right now. And as soon as we know more, we'll be happy to update in future calls going forward, but unfortunately I don't have greater \u2013 again, we remain very confident that it will eventually be approved. But we need to go through a new process with a regular that hasn't an animal health under CBM approved in monoclonal antibodies previously. So it's a little bit different for us. So this is the best we know at this point. Sure. For 2021, our focus remains on companion animals. We're very pleased with our progress on placements, which is a really good leading indicator of usage. As you saw, we had double-digit consumable growth as well, which we're quite pleased with. As we look at new products, we've added the Imagyst platform. We're excited with its first indication, obviously in fecal, that's the AI-powered one. We're looking for additional indications there. So the last piece there would also be reference labs. So we're continuing to expand our U.S. reference lab. So we're probably adding about three to five more labs this year. So we believe diagnostics is a core part of our portfolio. It's a market that grows at 10%, but we're really pleased that we're starting to see some strong momentum across the different parts of it. So both reference lab as well as placements as well as consumables. So we remain very committed to the space and are pleased with our progress over there. Sure. So starting on the Trio, we did see an increase in share in Q4 of 7%. So we are taking share in a number of places that's coming from. If you think about it, the first is new poppies, where I think we're doing quite well with new I think poppies. Also new people to the category overall, I would say, people who maybe previously had gotten products over the counter are moving in. And we are taking share from some of the other established competitors in this space. So I think we're seeing strong growth overall, I would say there and pleased at our share. If you look at the potential for the product, the two competitors NexGard and Prosecco are each $600 million products a day. So we continue to believe there's significant growth. We remain under index to be honest with you in parasiticide. So we continue to see this as a significant part of our overall growth From a sense \u2013 are there synergies with derm? Not really is what I would say, except for on a cost side. Obviously, we can get better buying power when you replace DTCs by leveraging the spend across both. But beyond that, we don't see strong synergies honestly between the DTC on one affecting the other, unless our clinic has to carry bolts and things like that, but we think maybe the only synergy there is just in our buying power by leveraging the combined DTC sense. Sure. I think the lifecycle for Librela and Solensia in the curve will be a slightly different. Librela is entering a market that's $400 million today. So it's an established market. So I think the ability for \u2013 people are already bringing their dogs in for OA pain. So I think we have the opportunity with Librela to expand the number of patients given the safety and efficacy profile and the compliance benefits of the product. I think we can also increase days on therapy. So it also helps us to grow the market and then obviously price to your point. So it is priced at a premium to many of the products on the market today. It is not \u2013 obviously, we don't have a price in the U.S. since we don't even have an approval yet in the U.S. I think Solensia is going to be a little bit different because the curve is going to take a little longer. And that has to do the fact that there really isn't a market today in most parts of the world. If you had a cat, there really was no treatment, so cat owners have kind of been condition to not bring their cats in. We've started focusing, about a year ago to try to build that market, make pet owners aware what OA pain looks like in cats and get \u2013 encourage them to start bringing their cats to the vet, and then getting vets to treat that. We think it's a significant market, but you have to first medicalize some of these conditions and treat it. It's significant. There's 60 million cats in the us U.S. And really only \u2013 but 40% of them have away, but only 18% of them are really identified by that. So we think both are significant markets that we can grow the market. So Solensia is more about creating a market. And I think you can look at our success in doing that with dermatology with Apoquel and Cytopoint. So we're investing early as Glenn has been talking about some of the guidance over the last year and for 2021 and building those markets. But I would assume the curves of Librela will be much faster than the curves of Solensia as we're building a market. Thanks Chris. We have been talking about the fact that to really get to the mid-single digits in a sustainable way. You're going to need innovation. I think there are few spaces where you're already starting to see that and some that will be coming. The first is around the vector vaccine space, which we have been talking about. In 2020, we launched our first one in the U.S. for Newcastle. In 2021, we launched one for IBV. We're looking for more launches there. This is a significant market, it's about a $300 million market growing double digit. So we do see vector technology and poultry, which is one of the faster growing, species being an area of innovation and growth for us. We also think more broadly that immunotherapies are going to be really important for two reasons. One, there are alternatives to antibiotics and secondly, healthier animals are more productive. So it also increases productivity for producers. So I think immunotherapies, which we've been working on for a while and have a partnership with Colorado state to develop will be important. The other sector that I think is really important to focus on is precision livestock farming which we also think has great potential. We're leaders right now in the genetic space there and genetic testing, we also purchased PLA as you know, we're looking at really back-to-back individual animal care and herd monitoring and I think that's probably the next big wave, that's probably more of a medium-term growth driver, but I think there's a number of spaces where you're going to see innovation at the livestock, across vectors, immunotherapies, and precision livestock farming. I'll let Glenn take the second question on long-term margin expansion. Sure. Thanks David. With regards to the monoclonal antibodies Librela and Solensia, it really is just working through the regulatory process and the questions that they're asking and they're requiring inspections of site. So at this point we have not been asked for any clinical data, but we're still in the regulatory process is what I was saying. It is the first time doing that with the FDA, so it's just a new process for both. Understandably it's the first time they're looking at some of these types of products, so they have a number of questions. So it really is just going through the regulatory review process and trying to manage new manufacturing inspections, which I do know probably the COVID is definitely affecting that a little bit, but we're just working through that. So at this point, we have not been asked for any additional clinical data and we don't think there's any manufacturing issue at this point. We're just still working through the review process and what their expectations are. With regards to Zoetis R&D, you know what I was saying is, I think it's the partnership between R&D, manufacturing and our commercial organization. It's taking those insights to the commercial as customer needs and partnering early on with R&D to develop products. I think the other thing we've done really well is partner with manufacturing to be able to scale those products and be able to bring them to market. We manufacture own monoclonal antibodies. As you know we've got very strong manufacturing capability, which is I think important for launching many of the products and scaling up at the level. We certainly learned the hard way early on in our journey about investing in that partnership, when we thought some of the challenges we had got supplying Apoquel. So I think from an R&D perspective, obviously I think we have great scientists, but I think it's the rigorous though process and partnership they have with our commercial and our manufacturing colleagues and our willingness to invest in disruptive technologies and take those risks that we've been doing. We've been managing over the last eight years. Anything you would add there Glenn? Sure. So first of all Kathy, great to hear from you. Secondly, on the math they are both the manufacturing facilities are different for them, but they are outside the U.S. And prior approval inspections, regulator can handle them differently, but they are going to be required probably for both of these products and they are both different, but they're both outside of the U.S. And I think your second question was around the derm sales growth in U.S. or ex-U.S. We still believe we're under penetrated outside the U.S. There's the same number of dogs in the U.S. and outside of U.S. gets two-thirds of our sales in derm remain in the U.S. So we do there's significant opportunity. It has been hard to get scale outside the U.S., historically mostly because we have been now able do direct-to-consumer advertising, that is brand specific. One of the investments we are going to make for the first time is doing just overall disease awareness in direct-to-consumer advertising in 2021. So we cannot be specific with brands, but in derm, we really are the only products. So hopefully if you raise awareness around a disease and that there are treatments you can encourage people to speak to their vet and get the best care. So that I think is one of the reasons why International, we are hoping will start to grow faster, but I have to give our U.S. team tremendous credit and they continue to grow the market. The investment in direct-to-consumer advertising, raising awareness to our products are bringing more pets in and getting more pets treated in. In the U.S., there are still 6 million dogs, who need our products or need a derm solution who aren't getting one. So we do believe there's still growth in the U.S., although we would expect, though I'm sure I know last years, we've seen very strong growth out of the U.S., we would expect over time for the U S growth start to decline the overall growth and more of the growth to come from international, but we still believe there's significant potential in both. Sure. With regards to the launch of Trio. I would say there's a lot of unique characteristics of the Trio launch. A, we launched at the height of the pandemic in the U.S. So I'm not sure how to compare that to other people's launches. We were slower to penetrate clinics, I would say in Q2 and Q3, but we're quite pleased that by the end of the year we reached all of our penetration goals. So I think our penetration has been quite strong, given the delay really the outperformance was our share once we were penetrated within the clinic, the ability to get more of the patients on our product has been really strong. And that gives us good confidence as we move into 2021. As Glenn mentioned a few minutes earlier, we are expecting a similar contribution. For starters, we'll have a Q1 where we didn't have sales last year, but with the penetration we were able to achieve by the end of the year, which is reaching the goals we had wanted. We think that we can just get the same pull through that we had at those clinics in 2021, we'll continue to see a great growth across with them there. We're also seeing it also pull our broader parasiticide portfolio. So I'm not sure I would say \u2013 I would use a human health analog, but I continue to remind everybody works. We remain under-penetrated in this space. And the herd is the single biggest category in the animal health space, it's $4 billion globally with $2.5 billion in the U.S. Continuing to see about 15% growth in Simparica beyond Trio, globally, it shows that there's significant opportunity here for us to continue to grow. And we were quite pleased if you looked at overall care, we had an increase in share of 7% in Q4. So we think we can continue to take share on this and grow it overall. So I'm not sure it looks like human health. But with our biggest competitors already being $600 million products. I think we've got strong ability to continue to grow as get at least our fair share in this space. Sure. with regards to pet adoption, there are 135 million pets in the U.S. In a typical year, you see about 3.2 million adoptions. So even a 10% increase in that isn't going to dramatically change things, but we are seeing an increase in vet visits which we think is a positive trend. And we do expect that to continue in 2021. So as Glenn mentioned earlier, we did see a 2% increase in vet visits in Q4. We are expecting that to continue. So I think you are seeing maybe a proportional to what were the incremental pets that were adopted. We don't have very specific numbers, but, I would say assume it's somewhere between like 2% and 10% there, it'll be helpful. And I do think we're going to continue to see an increase in visits. You asked us well about spend per visit, which was incredibly strong in 2020. We don't believe it's going to remain that strong to be honest with you. We still think it will grow. If you look generally speaking at our space, we've seen overall revenues of clinics growing in the mid-to-high single digits on normal year. I'm not sure what 2021 is going to look like, but assuming it's somewhere close to a normal year, we do think you're going to see strong growth overall there in spend, overall revenue in the vet clinic, both with growth in total number of visits, as well as a spend per visit. With regards to the trio questions on competition. We don't have the visibility that human health has as to when we'll get competitors. To be very frank, we would have expected a competitor by now. We would have expected one in derm as well. So we're not exactly sure what the challenge is, but we don't have a great way of knowing other than rumor mill in the market and strategic accounts who often try to renegotiate with us when they think a competitor is entering the market, which we haven't seen yet, that does not mean that, someone couldn't surprise us. So there could be, but we want it to be clear what our guidance was based on. So at this point, given we don't have any specific knowledge, we will assume we do not have competition in 2021. And as to when they would come, honestly we don't really know, but to your point, these are large markets, both your question on Trio but as well as derm and we are expecting competition. We just at this point do not have any specific knowledge. So our guidance did not include an assumption for competition in either space. Our next question from Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Thank you. Thanks everybody for your questions and your continued interest in the Zoetis today. We look forward to keeping you updated on our business throughout the year and continuing to deliver the results and innovations that you and our customers expect. Thanks so much for joining us."

            "name": "Glenn David",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.7 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, both exceeding the high-end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 9% operationally and 7% on a reported basis, with adjusted net income increasing 10% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. Going deeper into the numbers, price contributed 2% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 7%. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions with other in line products flat for the year. We again saw broad-based revenue growth with U.S. growing 11% and international growing 7%, operationally. The innovation we brought to the market and the diversity of our portfolio was key to our strong performance, as companion animal grew 17% while livestock was flat on a year-over-year basis. Performance from companion animal was led by our parasiticide portfolio bolstered by the launch of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $170 million. This added approximately $150 million of incremental revenue and exceeded our expectations set prior to the pandemic. Sales of Simparica also grew double digits for the year with operational revenue growth of 16%. Our key dermatology portfolio demonstrated continued strength in 2020, growing 23% operationally, generating revenue of $925 million and increasing more than $170 million versus prior year. The COVID-19 pandemic created a difficult market environment for livestock. However, we are encouraged by the resiliency displayed in 2020. We remain optimistic that global livestock will return to modest growth in 2021 as the recovery from African swine fever in China continues and consumption patterns normalize. Operational growth and adjusted net income of 10% was driven mainly by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Now moving on to our Q4 financial results, where we posted another strong quarter with revenue of $1.8 billion, representing an increase of 9% operationally and 8% reported. Adjusted net income of $438 million is an increase of 3% operationally and flat on a report basis. Operational revenue grew 9% with 2% from price and 7% from volume. Volume growth of 7% consisted of 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 1% from other in line products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 25% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal parasiticide grew 52% in the quarter, gaining market share in the U.S. of more than 7% in the flea, tick and heartworm segment versus the same period in the prior year. This includes the continued adoption of Simparica Trio which generated sales of $60 million in Q4. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint again had significant global growth in the quarter with $257 million of revenue, representing 27% operational growth versus an extremely difficult comparative period in which key derm grew 29% for the fourth quarter of last year. Our diagnostics portfolio again made positive contributions to revenue with reference lab expansion and double-digit growth in consumable and instrument revenue. The recovery in wellness visits continues to be a catalyst for growth following the slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. As we noted on our previous earnings call, the early fall cattle run hold a portion of fourth quarter sales into the third quarter, leading to a weaker quarter in cattle than we would typically expect. This was the primary driver of the 5% operational decline in livestock for the fourth quarter. For the remainder of the livestock portfolio, swine posted a second consecutive quarter of growth. With the herd rebuild continue in key accounts as the market recovers from African Swine Fever in China. Our aquaculture business grew high-single digits in the quarter and along with swine partially offset the decline in cattle and poultry. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment in the quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% with companion animal products growing 30% and livestock sales declining by 15%. For companion animal, the positive trends at the vet clinic continued in Q4 with patient visits up 2% and revenue per visit increasing by 13%. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of our Simparica franchise, as well as key dermatology products. We maintained an increase investment in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas and continue to see a good return on that investment. Simparica Trio performed well again in the quarter, with sales of $56 million. We remain extremely encouraged for the future growth of our product and the growth of the overall market segment as a material portion of Trio sales came from new patients to the category. Key dermatology sales were $176 million for the quarter, growing 32% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics. Companion animal diagnostics sales increased 22% in the quarter as a result of reconciled expansion and growth in point of care instruments and consumables. U.S. livestock declined 15% in the quarter driven primarily by cattle, which had a portion of Q4 sales pulled into the third quarter as a result of the earlier movement from pasture to feedlot. The remaining species declined as well with COVID-19 and pricing pressure negatively impacting our swine business. Poultry declines are largely attributed to product rotation and less producer profitability, leading to reduced usage of our premium products. To summarize U.S. performance innovation and return on investment, once again drove exceptionally strong growth in companion animal, while livestock was down in the quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. Revenue in our international segment grew 7% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and key dermatology products. Parasiticide growth in the quarter was again driven by comparative franchise with further adoption of Simparica Trio. In Q4 we observed a series of favorable market trends, such as increased pet ownership and medicalization rates in Asia. Overall companion animal grew in every major market except Italy and the UK, which had arguably the strictest lockdown protocols. Companion animal diagnostics grew 16% in the quarter led by an increase in point of care consumable usage. Swine revenue grew 14% operationally, posting a third consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Swine sales in China grew in excess of a 100% for the second straight quarter. Key accounts expanded their use of vaccines and other products as they continue to rebuild herds from smaller farms to large scale operations. China, total products grew 45% operationally in the quarter and 34% operationally for 2020. Brazil was also a significant contributor to international growth in the quarter, growing 18% operationally. For the fourth quarter and full year 2020, Brazil delivered double digit growth in all species except poultry, which modestly declined. Overall, our International segment delivered strong results despite the challenges presented by COVID-19. Our diversity across products and geographies enabled our International segment to again be a significant driver of growth. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, adjusted gross margin of 67.7%, fell 80 basis points in a reported basis compared to the prior year resulting from other manufacturing costs, inventory charges, recent acquisitions and elevated freight expense. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 10% operationally, resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense with Simparica Trio and Apoquel, partially offset by T&E savings. Return on investment from our DTC campaigns has been very favorable and we remain \u2013 and will remain an important investment to support future growth of the business. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.5%, a decrease of 70 basis points driven by the impact of net the discrete tax benefits, partially offset by jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter grew 3% operationally. In December, we announced 25% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In addition, we resumed our share repurchase program in January with $1.4 billion of remaining capacity under the current authorization. Now moving on to the guidance for 2021, please note the guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. For 2021, we are projecting revenue between $7.4 billion and $7.55 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We are expecting foreign exchange favorability in 2021 of approximately 200 basis points. We expect companion animal to be the primary driver of growth in 2021 with the continued strength of our diversed parasiticide portfolio which includes full year of Simparica Trio sales. We believe market dynamics for companion animal will remain strong in 2021, allowing for further expansion of our key dermatology products, as well as our diagnostics offerings, which we anticipate will grow faster than the overall animal health market. While we expect the pace of certain trends that accelerated in 2020 to moderate, such as increased spend per visit. Our view is that 2020 has a status of the higher base for future growth. We anticipate livestock will return to global growth in 2021, primarily driven by more normalized food consumption patterns. Geographically, we expect total company sales growth to be relatively balanced between our U.S. and International segments. However, we do expect continued and meaningful growth in China and other emerging markets. I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with dermatology, our guidance does not assume a meaningful competitive entry in 2021. And with continued investments behind the franchise, we believe revenue will exceed $1 billion for the full year. We also do not assume the triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2021 to compete against Simparica Trio. We're extremely excited about our monoclonal antibodies for pain, with both Librela and Solensia having long-term blockbuster potential. However, as Kristin mentioned, while both products will launch in the first half of 2021 in the EU and other international markets, we do not currently expect either product to receive approval in the U.S. this year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 30%, which is relatively consistent with our cost of sales in 2020. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $1.775 billion and $1.85 billion. With the increase in 2020 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including recent and future product launches, key brands and recent acquisitions, and reference lab expansion in diagnostics. Adjusted R&D expense for 2021 is expected to be between $500 million and $520 million as we remain committed to investing in pipeline opportunities for new therapies and life cycle innovation. Adjusted interest and other incomes deductions is expected to be approximately $260 million with the increase over 2020 driven by increased interest expense, as well as lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2021 is primarily related to the impact of favorable non-recurring discrete items that occurred in 2020. Adjusted net income is expected to be in a range of $2.08 billion to $2.13 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 12%. Our guidance reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, during the year when we'll be making meaningful investments to support future growth. Consistent with 2020, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures in 2021 to support investments in manufacturing, focused on internal sourcing of API, capacity increases and facilities to support pipeline opportunities. We're also investing in information technology to support our recent acquisitions, as well as digital capabilities and data analytics. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.36 to $4.46 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.14. While guidance represents full-year expectations, we do anticipate growth will be more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. This is largely due to full-year Simparica Trio sales and a favorable comparison versus Q2 2020 as a result of COVID-19. To summarize 2020 was another exceptional year in which we delivered 9% operational revenue growth and 10% operational growth and adjusted net income. And the year represented a unique set of challenges. Our guidance for 2021 highlights our ability to grow revenue organically above the market and grow adjusted net income faster than revenue even during times of elevated investment. Before turning it over to Q&A, I'd like to express how proud I am of our colleagues and all we've accomplished amidst an unprecedented set of circumstances. While there is no assurance that the New Year will be without similar challenges faced in 2020, we cannot be more excited about the opportunity to again deliver on our long-term shareholder value proposition. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Sure, Jon. So firstly, you look at the gross margin expectation for 2021. It is relatively flat versus 2020. As you mentioned, the mix with companion animal will be beneficial as we move into 2021. Some of the offsets to that, there were some of the investments that we're making in other areas such as reference labs, which come at a lower margin, particularly in the early stage of their life cycle is we're building those labs, [indiscernible] the margins will be a little lower until they reach their full operating scale. So that's some of the offsets. So there are some positives in terms of the companion animal mix. Some offsets there with some of the longer terms we're investing and making in other areas. In terms of the drivers of companion animal growth, so obviously we do expect Trio to be a significant driver of growth for 2021. We're not putting a specific number on Trio, but we would expect the contribution from growth in 2021 to be at least as big as what we achieved in 2020. So that'll obviously be one of the drivers, also continued growth in our dermatology portfolio. We saw very strong performance in 2020 with 23% growth in that portfolio operationally for the year. We do expect that portfolio will exceed $1 billion as we move into 2021. Also in companion animal diagnostics, we expect very rapid growth in diagnostics as well. In the fourth quarter, we saw 20% growth and we expect that will help carry us forward with the strong momentum that we had in the quarter into 2021, as well as strong performance that we're seeing in many of our emerging markets, such as China and Brazil. So those are some of the factors that are driving the strong companion animal growth. Yes. So the trends for companion animal will remain very strong. It's really driven by the breadth of our portfolio. So we talked a lot about the growth that we expect to see from Trio from our derm portfolio, from our diagnostics portfolio. Also in 2021, we'll have the launch of our monoclonal antibodies for pain in Europe, as well as some other markets. We'll also be a key contributor to growth. But then there are other products that round out the portfolio; products such as ProHeart 12, products such as Revolution Plus. Also the growth that we're seeing in markets like China, where companion animal is growing very rapidly, markets like Brazil. So there are really many areas of growth that we see. And that's driven by the fact and we do have the broadest portfolio in companion animal. We're able to leverage that with our customers. Yes. So, Erin, I think your question was around how we're performing with the breadth of our portfolio from parasiticide with our customers. And I think that's going very well in the veterinary clinics. We're really able to offer our customers a variety of options based on how they want to best treat the animals. And I think that shows in the performance that we saw on the Simparica franchise in 2020. Not only did we exceed our goals for Trio with $170 million in sales in the year, but we also saw significant growth in Simparica, which really exceeded our expectations. So we grew operationally 16% with Simparica. What we saw was that the advertising and driving patients into the clinic for Simparica Trio actually benefited the overall portfolio. We also saw a very positive growth in ProHeart 12 as well. So we think the breadth of the portfolio and the parasiticides was really a benefit and our field colleagues really able to execute very well with that portfolio. Sure. So when you look at overall livestock, and particularly in China, so we've seen very positive performance in livestock in China this year. So from a livestock perspective, we grew 45% in China this year and we expect continued strong performance in China in 2021 as we continue to see the herd rebuild, recovery from African swine fever. And where we're seeing that recovery is particularly in our larger accounts and the larger accounts use more of the multinational products than our premium products. So we've seen a really rapid acceleration of our growth, for example, in the second half of the year in swine in particular in 2020, we grew over 100% in swine in China. And we expect very positive momentum moving into 2021 and very significant growth from China in 2021. In terms of the operating margins, there are a couple of things to look at as we move into 2021. A, number of areas of investments that we have in our SG&A, really continuing to support the growth of Trio as well as the monoclonal antibodies for pain as well as dermatology. We've increased our DTC investment in 2020, particularly around Trio and derm, and we plan on continuing that in 2021, as we saw very positive return on investment there. Obviously, we'll continue to invest in R&D. And that'll be an area of continued investment as we've seen a very positive return on that investment as well. The other thing to consider when you look at the overall guidance, which \u2013 with revenue growing 9% to 11% and income growing 9% to 12%; one of the reasons that income isn't growing more rapidly is the change in assumption in tax rate between 2020 and 2021. In 2020, our rate was 18.3%. Our guidance for 2021 is approximately 20%. If you neutralize for the impact of the tax rate, our adjusted net income would actually be growing 2% faster, so more 11% to 14%. So we are seeing margin expansion, but the impact of the tax rate is diluting that to some degree. Yes. So in terms of the long-term margin expenses, there are a couple of factors to consider. So for 2021, we mentioned that the gross margin is relatively flat and talked about some of the drivers of that with some of the investments we're making in reference labs, also the impact of the Draxxin LOE this year on gross margin. So as we move into the 2022 and beyond some of those impacts will be a little less than we would expect to see continued expansion in gross margin. In terms of the overall operating expenses, beyond 2021, obviously there will be one-year where T&E normalizes, when things get back to normal from COVID, but beyond that impact, we would expect that we would continue to be able to grow our expenses at a pace below that of revenue. So we'll probably continue to grow R&D in line with revenue. That may vary any given year based on the opportunities, but SG&A based on the infrastructure that we have globally established, we should be able to grow that somewhere between inflation and revenue. So we would expect to continue to see expansion there on an overall operating margin perspective. I think it's exactly what you said, Kristin. We talked about the inter-connect capabilities between commercial manufacturing and R&D. And I think that works extremely well here. Like Kristin said, identifying what the key needs are in the marketplace, early on coming up with solutions and making sure that the products that we're able to manufacture and we've been very successful in doing that. Yes. And the only thing, I have to add in terms of the question on peak sales. What becomes challenging with peak sales is the timing of competition and that remains unknown. Obviously for 2021, our current guidance does not expect another triple combo within the U.S. and the timing of that will obviously impact what our overall peak sales could be for the product. Yes. So in terms of the impact of the early fall cattle run for 2020, that did not have an impact for the year that was just the seasonal impact between Q3 and Q4. I think you saw the very strong performance in Q3, you saw the opposite occur in Q4 of this year, and then predicting seasonality of that in 2021 obviously is difficult, but we focus more on the full year obviously in terms of the overall impact. In terms of gross margin for the diagnostic business, we don't specifically provide gross margins by therapeutic area or by species. But overall we always say our companion animal business obviously has the higher margin, diagnostics in general is lower than some of our key therapeutic areas. So in terms of the diagnostics growth for the quarter, like you said we did see a 20% growth in diagnostics. A part of that was driven by the reference lab acquisitions that we had. So net of that organic growth was around 12% to 13% in diagnostics for the quarter. So still very positive growth in the quarter. We saw a nice momentum as we move throughout the year, and we think that'll carry us well into 2021. Also, we established a much better infrastructure for diagnostics in 2020 in two ways. A, we fully integrated into our core SAP system in the diagnostics business. So we now are able to provide one phase to our customer in terms of billing as well as product offerings. The other thing that we did was we made significant improvements in our bi-directional connectivity, improving significantly throughout the year. At the beginning of the year, we had that connectivity to about 30%. We increased that at the end of the year to over 70%. So we think that establishes very well as we're moving to 2021, as well as some of the new innovation we're bringing with the images platform as well. So we think those are some of the key drivers as we move into 2021, as well as the continued reference lab expansion that we're embarking on. So we're very excited about the growth that we expect to see in diagnostics in 2021. In terms of key input costs and inflation for us from a manufacturing perspective, there's nothing in particular that we see particularly challenging. Obviously for 2020, we had some elevated freight costs because of the impact of COVID-19 that will probably continue as we move into 2021 that is embedded in our guidance, but nothing else of a significant impact."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2020 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I\u2019ll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company\u2019s 8-K filing dated today, November 5, 2020. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Once again, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy as this pandemic continues to be pervasive and unpredictable, with COVID cases spiking again in several regions of the U.S. and around the world. We are all facing the uncertainty and fatigue that has come with this pandemic. But I\u2019m also grateful and pleased today to share results that reflect the resilience of the animal health industry, the outstanding performance of our colleagues at Zoetis and the essential value we are providing our customers. At Zoetis, we stayed very responsive to the needs of our colleagues and customers throughout the year. We\u2019ve prioritized \u2013 our global supply chain and manufacturing operations are running well with safety and quality as our top priority. And we\u2019ve maintained operations at normal capacity and with no loss output. As we look ahead, we\u2019re fortifying our network of suppliers and building inventory level. We\u2019re also planning further contingencies for supply and distribution in the month ahead. Our R&D programs also remain on track despite the pandemic challenges, and our field force has been very adaptive to the changing protocols, lockdowns, and customer needs in various markets. Thankfully, our purpose, caring for healthier animals and a healthier world has never been more important, apparent and appreciated. Thanks to the resilience of our customers and the commitment of our colleagues, we were able to generate better-than-expected results in the third quarter. Our diverse and innovative portfolio has been driving growth this quarter with companion animal products up 20% operationally and livestock product sales up 9% operationally. Our newest parasiticides, including Simparica Trio, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 led the way again, along with vaccines, key dermatology products and our diagnostics portfolio, including reference labs. The third quarter also benefited from sales growth in the U.S. cattle market and China\u2019s swine market. As a result of the sales growth and target investments, we delivered adjusted net income growth of 20% operationally for the third quarter, reflecting on our 9 month performance and despite expectations for a more modest fourth quarter, we are increasing our revenue and adjusted net income guidance for the full year. Glenn will provide more details around guidance updates in his remarks. This year has shown once again that animal health is a steady and reliable sector, even in times of economic hardship. The world\u2019s fundamental need for nutrition, comfort and companionship provided by animals has proven durable and enduring over time. In the U.S., veterinary clinic revenues for pets are increasing at double-digit rates. Pet owners are focusing again on wellness and chronic ailments, not just emergency visits and acute care. While spending more time with their pets, pet owners are much more attuned to their dogs and cats health, observing conditions like itchiness, dermatitis, and pain. While clinic visits are relatively flat in the U.S., they\u2019re actually seeing an increase in average spend per visit. We expect to continue to see our strength coming from companion animal products, especially our parasiticide and key dermatology portfolios across global markets. Simparica Trio\u2019s launch and penetration into new clinics in the U.S. and elsewhere is going well, despite the headwinds of COVID-19. And we\u2019re seeing a good return to our direct-to-consumer advertising and digital campaign for Simparica and Apoquel. Meanwhile, in the livestock sector, producers are adapting to the changes in our end-markets for protein. And our third quarter growth was driven by increased sales in cattle, swine and fish. The spikes in COVID cases, limitations on dining out and shifts in production capacities will continue to make livestock a longer-term recovery story that may vary by region and species, another reason our diverse portfolio and global footprint is such an advantage. Looking ahead, we have stayed focused on advancing our 5 key priorities, drive innovative growth, enhance customer experience, lead in digital and data analytics, cultivate a high-performing organization, and champion a healthier and more sustainable future. Throughout the year, we\u2019ve stayed on track with our execution and investments in these areas, supported by a strong cash position and clear strategy. In the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone for our pipeline for pain management and pests. As you know, there\u2019s been limited innovation in this area over the last 20 years. And we\u2019re excited by the potential of monoclonal antibodies or mAbs to be the next breakthrough in long-term pain management. We\u2019ve been building on our research and leadership in monoclonal antibodies for several years, and gained valuable experience in the development and launch of our dermatology product Cytopoint in 2016. In September, Zoetis received a positive opinion on our latest mAb, Librela, from the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products in Europe. Upon full approval by the European Commission, Librela will be the first injectable monoclonal antibody licensed for alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. The European Commission approval is anticipated later this year, with the potential launch in the first half of 2021. We have additional regulatory submissions for Librela under review by health authorities in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. And we are progressing with similar regulatory reviews for monoclonal antibody therapy that can help manage osteoarthritis pain in cats, a condition that is vastly under-diagnosed or treated in cats today. We also continue to bring our leading product into new markets. On the companion animal side, Simparica was recently approved in China, and Cytopoint and Revolution Plus gained approvals in additional markets in Asia and Latin America respectively; and in livestock received approval in Japan for 2 of our leading swine vaccine, Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCV; all great examples of how we build and expand our innovation-based franchises. Last quarter, I previewed our latest diagnostic innovation Vetscan Imagyst, which features a cloud-based artificial intelligence platform. Since then, we have launched it in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the U.S. And customers have been enthusiastic about its potential to simplify point-of-care workloads and improve the consistency of results. And finally, we remain committed to creating a healthier and more sustainable world through our work as a leader in animal health. We\u2019ve been formalizing our strategy this year and look forward to sharing baseline metrics that are aligned with leading ESG reporting standards before the end of this month. Now, let me hand it off to Glenn, who will speak more about our third quarter results and updated guidance for the full year.\nGlenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during these difficult times, and I thank you for joining us today. We delivered another solid quarter with significant growth in both our companion animal and livestock portfolios. And we continue to be encouraged by the strength and resiliency of our business, despite the challenging environment due to the pandemic. Today, I will provide commentary on our Q3 results, update you on our improved full year 2020 guidance and discuss our expectations for Q4. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.8 billion, growing 13% on a reported basis and 15% operationally. Adjusted net income of $524 million was an increase of 15% on a reported basis and 20% operationally. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue in the quarter by 2%, driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Operational revenue growth was 15% with contributions of 2% from price and 13% from volume. Volume growth of 13% includes 5% from other in-line products, 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 20% operationally with livestock growing 9% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticides portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada and Australia. We also saw growth in our small animal vaccine portfolio and our key dermatology products, Cytopoint and Apoquel. The positive momentum for Simparica Trio continued in the third quarter, and we expect full year incremental revenue of between $125 million to $150 million. As we\u2019ve previously mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited our ability to visit and penetrate clinics at the rate we had originally expected. However, we are finding that once the clinic has converted to Simparica Trio, the adoption level within the clinic is resulting in meaningful incremental market share. We\u2019re also extremely pleased with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio, which in the U.S., gained an additional 6% market share in the flea, tick and heartworm segment for the third quarter versus the same period in the prior year. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $251 million in the quarter, growing 16% operationally and contributing 3% to overall revenue growth. Our diagnostics portfolio also contributed to growth due to the continued recovery of wellness visits following a slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our U.S. cattle business seeing a return to historical distributor buying patterns following the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter. In addition, the fall cattle run occurred earlier in the year, causing a portion of fourth quarter sales to be pulled forward into the third quarter. And as a result, we expect a significantly weaker fourth quarter in cattle than we typically deliver. For the remaining livestock species, swine returned to growth in the quarter, resulting from expanding herd production in key accounts and increased biosecurity measures in the wake of African Swine Fever in China. We also remain encouraged by the strength of our aquaculture business, which posted a 4th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Poultry declined modestly in the quarter, which partially offset the growth in cattle, swine and fish. New products contributed 4% growth in the quarter, driven by companion animal parasiticides, Simparica Trio, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12. Recent acquisitions contributed 1% of growth this quarter, including our expansion to reference labs and the Platinum Performance nutritionals business. Now let\u2019s discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 18% with companion animal products growing 21% and livestock sales increasing by 13%. For companion animal, we continued to be encouraged by vet clinic trends with revenue per clinic up 12% in the quarter and demand for our products remaining robust. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We continued to invest in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas, and we have seen a good return on that investment. Simparica Trio continued to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $44 million, despite difficult market conditions for a new product launch. Key dermatology sales were $180 million for the quarter, growing 17%, with significant growth for Cytopoint and Apoquel, resulting from additional patient share and an expanding addressable market. Diagnostic sales increased 28% in the quarter as a result of our reference lab acquisitions and increased point-of-care consumable usage. U.S. livestock grew 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by cattle. As I mentioned, purchasing patterns returned to historical levels, and we saw earlier movement from pasture to feedlot both contributing to a significant volume increase for our products. To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a difficult market environment. We remain enthusiastic about the recovery and trends we\u2019re observing in companion animal products. While livestock delivered an exceptional third quarter, as we\u2019ve indicated in the past, we do not expect a sustainable recovery until the middle of 2021. Revenue in our International segment grew 11% operationally in the quarter with growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which was flat in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 20% operationally and livestock revenue grew 6% operationally. Increased sales in companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and our key dermatology products. Parasiticide growth in the quarter was driven by the Simparica franchise, including the continued adoption of Simparica Trio, as well as increased promotional activity for Revolution. In the EU, limited access to veterinary clinics due to COVID-19 restrictions presented challenges for companion animal product sales in the second quarter, but in the third quarter we saw pent-up demand begin to work its way through the system, particularly for small animal vaccines. Companion animal diagnostics grew 17% in the quarter led by an increase in point-of-care consumable usage. International livestock growth in the quarter was driven by swine, fish and cattle. Swine delivered another strong quarter with 16% operational revenue growth, primarily driven by China, which grew 159%. While a significant portion of China\u2019s growth reflects the impact of African swine fever in the prior year, we\u2019re continuing to see expansion in our key accounts as production shifts from smaller forms to large scale operations. Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 10% operationally, driven by an increase in market share in vaccines and the acquisition of Fish Vet Group. Overall, our International segment delivered strong results and was a key contributor to revenue growth with significant growth in companion animal, swine and fish. We are also encouraged to see cattle return to growth in what are still difficult market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 69.6% fell 50 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of negative FX, the manufacturing costs and recent acquisitions. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally, resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio and Apoquel. We have strategically reallocated savings, mainly from T&E costs into these high return promotional programs, which have been successful in increasing sales. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, a decrease of 50 basis points, driven by the impact of net discrete tax benefits. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 20% operationally primarily driven by revenue growth, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 21% operationally. The strength of our balance sheet, along with the significant free cash flow we generate, has enabled us to execute on our investment priorities including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development. While we suspended our share repurchase program for the last 2 quarters to preserve cash during the pandemic, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend. In addition, share repurchases are a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate the appropriate time to resume the program. Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2020. We are raising guidance for a second consecutive quarter as a result of our third quarter performance and the improving companion animal market environment. While the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges and risks, we remain confident in the resiliency and durability of our diverse portfolio. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October. For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $6.55 billion and $6.625 billion and operational revenue growth of between 7% and 8% for the full year versus the 3% to 6% in our August guidance. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $1.79 billion to $1.825 billion representing operational growth of 6% to 8% compared to our prior guidance of 1% to 5%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.76 to $3.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.38 to $3.45. We are anticipating a deceleration of revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting from weaker performance in our livestock business. The impact will filter down to adjusted net income, which will also be affected by increased expense as we invest in future revenue growth. In addition, adjusted net income has a difficult comparative period as a result of nonrecurring discrete tax benefits recorded in Q4 2019. In closing, we delivered another strong quarter, demonstrating the resiliency of our business, even in these challenging market conditions. I\u2019d like to once again express how extremely proud we are of our colleagues, and the commitment they have demonstrated towards our customers and our company. Now, I\u2019ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. So I have a couple of questions here. One is on the guidance, the step-down in organic growth trajectory in the fourth quarter. I assume that has to do with the underlying conduct, in the end you were speaking to. But is there any other dynamics we should be thinking about in the fourth quarter? And how that month-to-month trend has progressed here? And then, lastly on mix dynamics in the gross margin, what were some of the key drivers of the gross margin trend in the quarter? Has anything changed in terms of the underlying profit profile of the companion animal business? Just given the strength there, maybe we thought that would be a little bit higher. Thanks.\nGlenn David: Sure. So I\u2019ll take both of those questions, Erin, thank you. In terms \u2013 I\u2019ll address the mix dynamics first. Nothing has changed really in terms of the underlying dynamics. A couple of factors related to the gross margin. A, foreign exchange was particularly unfavorable in this quarter, so that led to a step-up, a little bit in cost of goods, so that lowered the overall gross margin percentage. Also, we continued to invest in some of the new areas for growth, such as reference labs and some of the acquisitions, which also has a lower gross margin profile than our core business. But in terms of the underlying dynamics for companion animal and continued growth there being \u2013 continue to be an overall benefit for gross margin. But the FX as well as some of the investments we\u2019re making in newer businesses such as reference labs did have a negative impact. In terms of the guidance for Q4 and the implied step-down in revenue, a couple of key factors there. A, U.S. cattle being one of the larger ones. We had a very strong quarter in U.S. cattle in Q3, really driven by 2 factors. A, the acceleration of the fall cattle run bringing some sales from Q4 into Q3. As well as a normalization of buying patterns in Q3 that resulted in some incremental sales that we did not expect to repeat in Q4. The other thing to consider for U.S. cattle in Q4 is the impact of DRAXXIN LOE in 2021. We do anticipate that some of our customers may change their buying patterns for Q4, which could result in less sales. As I mentioned, there are impacts beyond just revenue for Q4. Really, the adjusted effective tax rate is a big driver from an income growth perspective. We had a very favorable tax rate in Q4 of last year that will not repeat this year and will have a negative impact on our overall income growth.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll move to our next question. It comes from Jon Block with Stifel\nJon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Glenn, maybe just to start with you, and I\u2019ll actually just pick up where you left off on DRAXXIN. I know you\u2019re not going to go down the road of overall 2021 guidance. But obviously, we all sort of want to sharpen our pencils, if you would. And so, as we think about DRAXXIN in generic next year, should we just be cognizant of call it maybe a $300-million-plus top-line item with a year 1 20%-headwind-ish? If you could, comment on that. And then, Kristin, for you, congrats on moving the pain mAbs forward. Any commentary on the revenue ramp that we might see there? And if you feel like you\u2019ve got a good runway with these offerings in front of any large molecule competition? Thanks, guys.\nGlenn David: Sure, Jon. So, I\u2019ll take the DRAXXIN question. So as you mentioned, DRAXXIN is a very large product in animal health, over $300 million, a large product for us as well. Because of that, we do expect to see significant generic competition and a number of manufacturers being prepared with a generic product. So we do typically see a 20% to 40% impact over time, once a product faces generic competition. Because of the size of DRAXXIN, we do expect that, that will occur over a little more rapid period than we\u2019ve seen in the past with some smaller products\nKristin Peck: Sure. I\u2019ll build on the profile for the mAbs. As we talked about, we did get the positive CVMP opinion on Librela. We are expecting an approval later this year with the hope of launching that in the first half of 2021. I know we\u2019ll probably get a question why first half. It really depends, is it February, March, it will be around that timeframe. Remember, International has an earlier quarter. So we will start to see a ramp on that product in 2021. We are still expecting approval of the cat pain product, [Cylenthia] [ph], in 2021 as well. We\u2019ll probably see approval of those in the U.S. in the later end of next year. So just to give you a sense of just where we see those revenues ramping, both cat and dog in the U.S. and EU.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Mike Ryskin with Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, thanks, guys. I\u2019ll start with a quick one on sort of the rebound from COVID and the recovery in the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if you could parse into a little bit. You had a comment in some of your prepared remarks about potentially some pent-up demand in Europe. And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense broader across the U.S. as well, how much you think the true underlying growth could have been versus what really is a little bit of pent-up demand? So I realize there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in terms of vets, vet re-openings and new pet adoption, things like that, but just curious how to think about that going forward. And then, Glenn, got a quick follow-up for you. Another comment you made on increased spending, reinvesting in the business. As we look out to 4Q, clearly, there\u2019s a big SG&A ramp in the guidance if you sort of bridge your revenue gap to your EPS target. I\u2019m just thinking how should we think about 2021? What\u2019s the appropriate base for that, because there\u2019s obviously some spend that you pulled back this year. So how much of that comes back, how much extra do you need to invest for things like Librela and Trio next year? I\u2019m just trying to get the moving pieces down. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll start on the COVID recovery question. I think what you clearly saw in Q3 was a significant rebound in companion animal to people going back to vet business. But really, the big growth driver there wasn\u2019t really an increase in vet visits from 2019. Maybe there\u2019s an increase from Q2 to Q3. It was really an increased spend per visit, which we think is a trend that will continue as long as people spend more time at home with their pets, they are noticing more and more things are getting diagnosed, as well as increased use of diagnostics. And that is really we believe definitely U.S. trend, but we also believe a global trend there. So we think companion animal will continue to do well. I think in the remarks, what we had alluded to was that specifically U.S. cattle where, we saw real \u2013 in Q2 a significant dip, people not wanting to hold too many inventories. In Q3, it was just more of a return to \u2013 normalizing that. But the other trend was really the move, I mean, it wasn\u2019t COVID related, just weather-related, moving of the fall run. So overall from a COVID recovery, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any pent-up demand that we\u2019re processing anymore. I think things have largely stabilized. Obviously, when you see the number of cases increasing in the U.S. and globally, that\u2019s right now baked into the guidance we\u2019ve given you, assuming that things don\u2019t get remarkably worse or remarkably better. But I think all that\u2019s sort of baked in. And as we look into next year, I think it\u2019s a little too early for us to really tell exactly what that\u2019s going to look like. But I think the key message for us, as you look at our performance and our guidance for the year, is that we\u2019ve been an incredibly resilient and essential business. And that has really been great for our customers, for our colleagues and for our shareholders.\nGlenn David: Yeah, Mike, in terms of the increased spending in the quarter, so as you mentioned, we did increase spending in Q3 with total OpEx up about 9%, and SG&A up 11%. And really, what we did there is we took a lot of the savings that we saw from T&E and made incremental investments behind some of our key growth brands, particularly Simparica Trio and Apoquel in the tune of DTC advertising, which was even greater than the savings that we saw from a T&E perspective, because we believe those are the right investments, and we\u2019re seeing a very strong return on those, to support the future growth of the brands. In terms of what you mentioned for Q4 that the EPS gap between revenue and EPS, the gap there being driven by OpEx, obviously, the bigger driver there actually is more related to what I mentioned in terms of the change in the tax rate quarter-over-quarter and the incremental interest expense. It\u2019s really not that OpEx. It\u2019s disproportionate to revenues. The changes that we\u2019re seeing year-over-year, just based on some quarterly fluctuations in the tax rate as well as the incremental interest expense that we\u2019re going to see in Q4 based on the funding that we did earlier this year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on a good quarter. So on Trio, at least from our research, we\u2019re not seeing any competitive entrants yet and spring is a half year way, VMX is coming up in 2 months. Is there any \u2013 can you help us think about the difference in your \u2013 in the Trio peak sales expectation in the event the competitor doesn\u2019t launch until after the spring? And then as a follow-up to Trio, how had a full season of it? Are you seeing more adoption from heartworm customers or maybe legacy tick and flea prescribers only? And kind of what I\u2019m trying to get at that is, essentially there is regional differences in prescribing behavior and I\u2019m just trying to figure out, again, market size question on Trio. Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, David. I\u2019ll start with we\u2019re not anticipating any combination competition in the U.S. this year or in the first half of next year. As we\u2019ve talked about many times, we don\u2019t have phenomenal intelligence the same way human health does, but we continue to believe that. And to build up on Glenn\u2019s comments, as a result, we are investing heavily behind this product in DTC to gain market share as quickly as we can. As we look at sort of the growth, Glenn also mentioned in his remarks that the penetration of clinic is improving, but probably not as great as we would have wanted, given the difficulty in detailing the product in person. However, where we have penetrated, the sales have been much higher. And honestly, we\u2019ve been cannibalizing Simparica much less than we expected. And we\u2019re really seeing is an overall bringing more people in. If you look at flea, tick, heartworm, really only 10% of people who are even taking it are 100% compliant. So we think that remains a significant opportunity for us. And again, we have a strong franchise here across parasiticides and flea, tick, heartworm. And as Glenn also mentioned, we had a 6% share gain in the overall category, which I think is really impressive. So whether that\u2019s Simparica, Simparica Trio or ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, we believe we have the portfolio for our customers no matter where they are in the country, how they practice or what their pet owners\u2019 needs are. So we continue to believe there\u2019ll be strong growth there, and we\u2019re going to invest behind this brand next year, while we remain the only triple combination in the U.S.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question here. So I wanted to ask you, broadly speaking, how should we think about 2021 sales and margins? And if you can\u2019t give any specifics, could you talk about some likely scenarios that could play out given a lot of moving parts we see in the year to come? Thank you.\nGlenn David: Yeah. So in terms of 2021, Louise, obviously, we will be providing guidance for 2021 in February as we typically do. A couple of things to think about, right, the long-term fundamentals of the industry remain very strong with increasing pet ownership and also animal protein consumption continuing to grow. I think the other thing to think about for 2021, I think COVID has proven that this industry remains extremely resilient and we\u2019re still able to grow very rapidly, operate very profitably even during these times. Looking into 2021, there are some things that we\u2019re very excited about. Obviously, the continued growth that we expect to see in Trio, continued growth of our derm portfolio, and obviously, the approval of our mAb portfolio and the launch within the EU coming in the first half of the year that Kristin mentioned. Some of the things that may be a headwind, obviously, are the DRAXXIN LOE. But again, with the growth that we expect to see in some of the other brands that we\u2019ve mentioned, we do expect that for 2021 we\u2019ll be able to continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition of growing faster than the overall market.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Kristin, maybe to start, could you comment on the longer-term kind of market opportunity for the monoclonal antibody products in pain? How should we think about the market for osteoarthritis? And then beyond that, is there a potential to kind of expand to additional indications? And then I had a follow-up on diagnostics. Could you kind of comment on underlying growth excluding the reference lab acquisitions? And can you update us on your progress with getting customers to kind of utilize the platform across both the in-clinic and reference labs solutions that you have?\nKristin Peck: Sure. So thanks, Nathan. I\u2019ll start on just looking at the overall market for pain, starting with Librela since it will probably be our first approval there at least in Europe. Pain right now in dogs is around a $400 million market, but there hasn\u2019t been significant innovation in that space. And although we do not yet have a label for our product, we believe that a monoclonal antibody will have a strong efficacy as well as safety profile. And we think that we\u2019ve demonstrated, certainly in derm, our ability to grow the market to really raise awareness, bringing innovation in, brings new customers in and new options. So we do really believe we can continue to do that. If you look at it today, there\u2019s about 165 million dogs across the EU and the U.S., and about 40% of them will get OA. And right now, depending on whether in the U.S. or Europe, really diagnosis is somewhere between 25% and 40%. So we do believe there\u2019s a significant opportunity to both grow the market as well as bring people in and better diagnose that to really help that. That\u2019s really where we see our \u2013 the market on dog. If you focus on cat, we think there\u2019s an even bigger market here mostly because many cats are not medicalized today. There are 160 million cats about 40% of them as well have OA. But here, you\u2019re really seeing, whether you\u2019re in the U.S. or the EU, only about 14% of them being diagnosed. And in the U.S., there really is not an alternative. There really is no pain product for cats. There are a few options in Europe. But we really see this as a significant opportunity and ability to grow the medicalization of cats and really to diagnose pain and to treat it. So we\u2019ve demonstrated certainly in dermatology our ability to create and to grow markets. And we very much believe across both Librela and [Cylenthia] [ph] in dog and cat that we will have the opportunity to do that. We are not expecting competition at this point, certainly in 2021 from what we understand in this market. So we do believe it\u2019s our ability to continue to drive growth and really provide new opportunities for both vets and pet owners to treat pain.\nGlenn David: And in terms of the diagnostic growth. So if you look at companion animal diagnostic growth for the quarter, we grew about 24%. Backing out the impact of reference labs, that growth was around 13%. So we saw very strong growth in our consumable usage. Obviously, our instrument revenue was down as it\u2019s been a little more challenging to get into the clinics took place new instruments, but very strong performance in our overall consumable revenue growth. In terms of the benefit that we\u2019ve seen in the usage of both the reference labs and the point-of-care together, we are very early in our reference labs strategy. We are looking to build out a network across the U.S., but that will take some time. So we\u2019re still early on in that build-out.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nEkaterina Knyazkova: Hey, this is actually Ekaterina on for Chris. Thank you for taking my questions. In the first question is you\u2019ve touched upon this, but should we be thinking about the durability of some of the COVID-19 tailwinds that we\u2019ve seen in U.S. companion like rising pet adoptions and increasing standard of care per visit? Do you think that this is something that reverses as those people come back into the office and don\u2019t spend as much time with their pets? Or is this something that can be more durable as you think about 2021 and beyond? And then the second question is on the International companion business. So with some of the recent lockdown orders across Europe, what are you seeing on the ground in terms of any initial data points on clinic visits and foot traffic and things like that? How should we be thinking about the trajectory of the International companion business relative to what we saw with the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Ekaterina. What I think we\u2019ve demonstrated is that overall animal health, and more specifically, pet care is a very resilient industry. And I think what we \u2013 what\u2019s probably been a little bit different in COVID, in a pandemic and certainly an economic challenges, people are adopting more pets. And more importantly, they\u2019re spending more time at home with those pets. So in a typical year, in the U.S., you\u2019ll see about 3.2 million adoptions. We don\u2019t have great data yet on what the increase is, but I think anecdotally, no matter where you sit, everyone has a new dog or cat in your neighborhood. So we\u2019re definitely seeing, as you look at our vaccine sales, certainly an increase in some of these areas. But I really think what\u2019s changing is dogs are becoming a greater part of the family. People are spending more time at home. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to change overnight. And therefore, they\u2019re noticing more conditions with their dogs. They\u2019re also spending more time at home, seeing our ads and realizing that they\u2019re \u2013 if they have a dog who\u2019s sick, there is a product for that. So I don\u2019t think that trend \u2013 maybe it was more accelerated this year, but I think those dogs and cats are here to stay. I think people will change their behaviors, and some of them, I think, around spending more time with the comfort, be it emotional or otherwise, of pets will continue. And as you look at Europe, your question with regards to COVID in Europe, the data in Europe, as you know, is not as reliable and \u2013 as in the U.S., there\u2019s not as many comprehensive data sources. But what we\u2019re hearing anecdotally is our customers figured out in Q2 how to continue to see pets through curbside check-ins, and that really hasn\u2019t changed. They figured out how to operate, given they\u2019re an essential business and we really don\u2019t \u2013 we have not seen so far any significant changes. Obviously, there\u2019s incremental lockdowns being announced, obviously, in the last 24 to 48 hours in Italy and other places. But as you look at our guidance for the year, unless it gets significantly worse, we think that\u2019s baked in. And I think if you look at what we\u2019ve learned between Q2 and Q3, we think that our customers will be able to manage well as we move into 2021, certainly on the pet care side, to manage continuing to see pets and to diagnose them either through telemedicine or through curbside check-in. So we do believe the trends there are resilient.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.\nJonathan Kaufman: Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. First, I would like to go back to diagnostics. I know your reps aren\u2019t able to visit the clinics as much as usual, but can you talk about the initial reaction to the IMAGYST product? When your field teams are discussing this with clients, understanding that right now it\u2019s only being used for fecal samples, how are they describing the potential for broadening out the potential use? I guess is there an expectation that there\u2019s going to be a consistent introduction of new applications? And then I would also just like to ask about poultry. Can you just provide more details around what\u2019s going on there? It\u2019s typically one of your faster-growing areas in livestock. So just trying to get a sense of what changed this quarter. Is it part of a typical rotation of product usage? Or is it some sort of competitive dynamics there? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I\u2019ll start on the diagnostic, on IMAGYST. We are very pleased with how that\u2019s going. As you know, the first indication for the IMAGYST, which is an AI-driven diagnostic, is in fecal. That\u2019s about a $500 million market, growing about 7%. People are excited at the opportunity for this technology and certainly for additional indications. So we are on track there, and I think we\u2019re very pleased with this progress. And given the positive receptivity to it, we are accelerating our investments to bring new indications overall there. And as you look at poultry, certainly in the U.S., there is definitely a rotation, which we always talk about, that was definitely a driver in the quarter, and I think you\u2019ll see again moving into Q4. It\u2019s also potentially one of the reasons we guided where we did on livestock overall in Q4. Obviously, there\u2019s the overall impact to all of the livestock sectors of COVID and less consumption and more dine-in versus dine-out. But poultry specifically, it was more around the rotation there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Balaji Prasad with Barclays.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. So I want to get to China and discuss both the companion animal side and the livestock side of the business. So you had a 63% growth in China. And I thought I heard you say that you had 140% growth in livestock. So could you, a, quantify any kind of sort swine re-herding happening in China and how the effects you\u2019re seeing on the business? And if the 140% number is correct? And secondly, on companion animal, could you speak about your expectations on Simparica? And also give us a sense of the time lag before you introduce Trio? And what are the gating factors to introduce that? Is it more regulatory or your own life cycle planning? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Glenn build on this. We were very pleased, obviously, with the growth in China and really the balance between companion animal and livestock there. Certainly, on the livestock side, we are seeing a faster-than-we-expected growth coming back from ASF. But really with the large integrated producers, there\u2019s still a significant ASF challenge there. But given the biosecurity of some of them, we are seeing significant growth there. And in companion animal, similar to some trends at other places, is just great growth across the portfolio and strong performance there, certainly on Revolution, launching RIMADYL, just now getting the approval on Simparica. It\u2019s more a timing of regulatory on Trio there, but I\u2019ll let Glenn get into some specifics on the numbers and the growth.\nGlenn David: Yeah. So just, again, to the details of the number. As you mentioned, overall, China for the quarter grew 63%. We saw 52% growth in companion animal and we saw 81% growth in livestock. And that 81% growth in livestock was driven by swine. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, swine grew 159% in China for the quarter. As we\u2019ve continued to see the recovery in some of our key accounts and the larger producers, we\u2019ve seen very strong performance of our products within those accounts.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Navin Jacob with UBS. And we will actually move on to Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company.\nKathleen Miner: Thank you. Good morning. Just 2 questions, please. First, I\u2019d just like to go back to the canine market, where you sized it up at about $400 million. Can you give us a sense of how much of that might be outside of the United States? And does the treatment of canine OA pain differ from the U.S. such that a launch or uptake may be different? And second question on Apoquel and Cytopoint. It looks like trends for those products continue to be very strong. So as you go forward, is this strength more sustainable than you may have initially thought pre-COVID just because there\u2019s more pets that have been adopted and owners are at home more, so perhaps you see more use of these products? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. So digging in a \u2013 first of all, Kathy, great to hear from you. As we look at the pain market for dogs, it\u2019s $400 million. If you look at the number of dogs, the EU has 90 million and the U.S. has 75 million. And as you look at, the 40% prevalence of OA is the same across. But in the U.S., really it\u2019s only diagnosed about 28% versus 50% in the EU. The only thing we\u2019ve learned with new technologies is that given we can do direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S., we tend to be able to ramp faster to peak sales when we\u2019re launching new technologies in the U.S. than we are able to do in Europe just given we can\u2019t do direct-to-consumer advertising that\u2019s brand-specific. So I do think we look at how fast can you ramp up that market in Europe. It will be slower than the U.S., what we have in U.S., just given the history. And ultimately, I think we\u2019ll do well there. But I think it is a little slower, I would say, overall there. And your second question was around, what was it?\nGlenn David: Around derm. So in terms of the opportunity for derm, so we continue to see really strong performance in the derm portfolio. We grew 16% this quarter with 21% growth year-to-date. In terms of the continued opportunity for growth, we see opportunities for growth in both the U.S. and International. So looking at the U.S., currently, there are about 75 million dogs in the U.S. and about 14 million dogs have itchiness. Of those 14 million dogs, today about 60% are treated. So there is still 40% of the dogs with itchiness that are not treated. So we do think there is an opportunity to continue to raise awareness of the disease state and get those itchy dogs continue to take Apoquel or Cytopoint. When you look outside of the U.S., we also see a big opportunity for growth. In terms of the breakout of our sales today, about two-thirds of our sales are U.S. and one-third is International. However, the number of itchy dogs is similar between those segments. So to the extent that we\u2019re able to continue to drive that adoption and awareness, we do believe that there is continued growth expected in the International markets as well.\nKristin Peck: And the other thing I\u2019ll say, we\u2019re still looking at not having competition, so at the earliest the second half of next year. So we\u2019re going to, obviously, continue to try to grow those as fast as we can and gain market share.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Navin Jacob with UBS.\nSriker Nadipuram: Hi, everyone. This is Sriker Nadipuram on for Navin Jacob. Apologies for getting cut off before. But I just have a couple of questions. So in anticipation for the DRAXXIN generic coming next year, what level of destocking can we expect to see? And then, maybe just on the medicalization rate in osteoarthritis, what\u2019s a good analog for how high you think it can get in dogs and cats in the U.S.? Thanks very much.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Starting on DRAXXIN, I mean, it\u2019s a little bit hard to tell you exactly what we think the destocking will be. I think given the expectation for many of our customers that they will see significant new generic entrants, I\u2019m sure they will think differently about building inventories ahead of normally what is our price increases in Q1, and that was sort of what Glenn was alluding to earlier. Obviously, we have a robust defense plan for DRAXXIN. It\u2019s an important product. We still have \u2013 given its high margin \u2013 significant pricing leverage here. But obviously, we anticipate that some of our customers who would normally stock up at the end of the year ahead of the price increase will not be doing so there. And how high can medicalization rates get for OA? I mean you\u2019d love to believe that all those dogs would be diagnosed. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to really ever get to that exact number. But we try to look at our ability, for example, in derm to try to do that. So we do think there\u2019s a significant opportunity, both because they\u2019re bringing innovation and we also believe that the anticipated potential safety profile of a mAb will bring more people out that are struggling certainly on the dog side, but definitely on the cat side as well. So I think it\u2019s a little too early to say exactly where you can go, but there\u2019s a significant opportunity. And we\u2019ve demonstrated before that we\u2019ve been able to grow markets as we\u2019ve entered them with new innovative technologies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is actually [Michael Paralary] [ph] on for Elliot Wilbur. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have actually been answered already, so I just have one for you on the topic of share repurchases. I know that you said that you\u2019re continuing to evaluate the resumption of the program. But given the strong recovery in the business, I was just wondering if you guys had any timeline specifically on when you\u2019re looking to resume the program, and if you\u2019re looking for anything specifically on deciding whether or not to resume the program? Thank you.\nGlenn David: Yeah, thanks, Michael. So in terms of share repurchase, we don\u2019t have any specific timeline. Obviously, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate. There\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace, particularly around COVID-19 and the timing that we expect to see a full recovery. So that\u2019s one of the factors that we\u2019ll continue to evaluate. One thing I\u2019ll say though is our capital allocation priorities have not changed, right, in terms of investing in the business as our first priority. And I think you see us doing a lot of that this year, even in light of COVID, particularly with the investments that we\u2019re making in DTC, the investments that we\u2019re making in R&D to continue to support the medium, short and long term growth of this company, also significant investments that we\u2019re making in manufacturing to ensure continuity of supply, and also investments that we\u2019re making from an inventory perspective, again, to ensure continuity of supply. So we are really focusing on some of those internal investments. We\u2019ve also been able to execute on some business development deals throughout this year as well even with the limitations that may be provided by COVID, but really good use of our capital across all areas.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from Balaji Prasad with Barclays.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, thanks for taking the question again. So I was just trying to check on your comment on the market share in the flea and tick and heartworm segment, 6% gain. I just wanted to clarify if that was based on a market size of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion, or could you clarify that? Thanks. And secondly also, what was the actual number for Trio this quarter?\nGlenn David: Yeah, so just to clarify, that was based on the U.S. market size of around $2.5 billion. And the second question was around Apoquel for the quarter \u2013 for Trio, I\u2019m sorry. So, the Trio for the quarter, we did $50 million in sales for Trio for the quarter.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no additional questions. I\u2019d like to turn the program back over to Kristin Peck for any closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions and continued interest in Zoetis. We look forward to keeping you updated on our business and continuing to deliver the results and innovations, that you and our customers expect for us. Stay well. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Once again, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy as this pandemic continues to be pervasive and unpredictable, with COVID cases spiking again in several regions of the U.S. and around the world. We are all facing the uncertainty and fatigue that has come with this pandemic. But I'm also grateful and pleased today to share results that reflect the resilience of the animal health industry, the outstanding performance of our colleagues at Zoetis and the essential value we are providing our customers. At Zoetis, we stayed very responsive to the needs of our colleagues and customers throughout the year. We've prioritized \u2013 our global supply chain and manufacturing operations are running well with safety and quality as our top priority. And we've maintained operations at normal capacity and with no loss output. As we look ahead, we're fortifying our network of suppliers and building inventory level. We're also planning further contingencies for supply and distribution in the month ahead. Our R&D programs also remain on track despite the pandemic challenges, and our field force has been very adaptive to the changing protocols, lockdowns, and customer needs in various markets. Thankfully, our purpose, caring for healthier animals and a healthier world has never been more important, apparent and appreciated. Thanks to the resilience of our customers and the commitment of our colleagues, we were able to generate better-than-expected results in the third quarter. Our diverse and innovative portfolio has been driving growth this quarter with companion animal products up 20% operationally and livestock product sales up 9% operationally. Our newest parasiticides, including Simparica Trio, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 led the way again, along with vaccines, key dermatology products and our diagnostics portfolio, including reference labs. The third quarter also benefited from sales growth in the U.S. cattle market and China's swine market. As a result of the sales growth and target investments, we delivered adjusted net income growth of 20% operationally for the third quarter, reflecting on our 9 month performance and despite expectations for a more modest fourth quarter, we are increasing our revenue and adjusted net income guidance for the full year. Glenn will provide more details around guidance updates in his remarks. This year has shown once again that animal health is a steady and reliable sector, even in times of economic hardship. The world's fundamental need for nutrition, comfort and companionship provided by animals has proven durable and enduring over time. In the U.S., veterinary clinic revenues for pets are increasing at double-digit rates. Pet owners are focusing again on wellness and chronic ailments, not just emergency visits and acute care. While spending more time with their pets, pet owners are much more attuned to their dogs and cats health, observing conditions like itchiness, dermatitis, and pain. While clinic visits are relatively flat in the U.S., they're actually seeing an increase in average spend per visit. We expect to continue to see our strength coming from companion animal products, especially our parasiticide and key dermatology portfolios across global markets. Simparica Trio's launch and penetration into new clinics in the U.S. and elsewhere is going well, despite the headwinds of COVID-19. And we're seeing a good return to our direct-to-consumer advertising and digital campaign for Simparica and Apoquel. Meanwhile, in the livestock sector, producers are adapting to the changes in our end-markets for protein. And our third quarter growth was driven by increased sales in cattle, swine and fish. The spikes in COVID cases, limitations on dining out and shifts in production capacities will continue to make livestock a longer-term recovery story that may vary by region and species, another reason our diverse portfolio and global footprint is such an advantage. Looking ahead, we have stayed focused on advancing our 5 key priorities, drive innovative growth, enhance customer experience, lead in digital and data analytics, cultivate a high-performing organization, and champion a healthier and more sustainable future. Throughout the year, we've stayed on track with our execution and investments in these areas, supported by a strong cash position and clear strategy. In the third quarter, we achieved an important milestone for our pipeline for pain management and pests. As you know, there's been limited innovation in this area over the last 20 years. And we're excited by the potential of monoclonal antibodies or mAbs to be the next breakthrough in long-term pain management. We've been building on our research and leadership in monoclonal antibodies for several years, and gained valuable experience in the development and launch of our dermatology product Cytopoint in 2016. In September, Zoetis received a positive opinion on our latest mAb, Librela, from the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products in Europe. Upon full approval by the European Commission, Librela will be the first injectable monoclonal antibody licensed for alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in dogs. The European Commission approval is anticipated later this year, with the potential launch in the first half of 2021. We have additional regulatory submissions for Librela under review by health authorities in the United States, Latin America and Asia Pacific. And we are progressing with similar regulatory reviews for monoclonal antibody therapy that can help manage osteoarthritis pain in cats, a condition that is vastly under-diagnosed or treated in cats today. We also continue to bring our leading product into new markets. On the companion animal side, Simparica was recently approved in China, and Cytopoint and Revolution Plus gained approvals in additional markets in Asia and Latin America respectively; and in livestock received approval in Japan for 2 of our leading swine vaccine, Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCV; all great examples of how we build and expand our innovation-based franchises. Last quarter, I previewed our latest diagnostic innovation Vetscan Imagyst, which features a cloud-based artificial intelligence platform. Since then, we have launched it in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the U.S. And customers have been enthusiastic about its potential to simplify point-of-care workloads and improve the consistency of results. And finally, we remain committed to creating a healthier and more sustainable world through our work as a leader in animal health. We've been formalizing our strategy this year and look forward to sharing baseline metrics that are aligned with leading ESG reporting standards before the end of this month. Now, let me hand it off to Glenn, who will speak more about our third quarter results and updated guidance for the full year. Sure. I'll build on the profile for the mAbs. As we talked about, we did get the positive CVMP opinion on Librela. We are expecting an approval later this year with the hope of launching that in the first half of 2021. I know we'll probably get a question why first half. It really depends, is it February, March, it will be around that timeframe. Remember, International has an earlier quarter. So we will start to see a ramp on that product in 2021. We are still expecting approval of the cat pain product, [Cylenthia] [ph], in 2021 as well. We'll probably see approval of those in the U.S. in the later end of next year. So just to give you a sense of just where we see those revenues ramping, both cat and dog in the U.S. and EU. Thanks, Mike. I'll start on the COVID recovery question. I think what you clearly saw in Q3 was a significant rebound in companion animal to people going back to vet business. But really, the big growth driver there wasn't really an increase in vet visits from 2019. Maybe there's an increase from Q2 to Q3. It was really an increased spend per visit, which we think is a trend that will continue as long as people spend more time at home with their pets, they are noticing more and more things are getting diagnosed, as well as increased use of diagnostics. And that is really we believe definitely U.S. trend, but we also believe a global trend there. So we think companion animal will continue to do well. I think in the remarks, what we had alluded to was that specifically U.S. cattle where, we saw real \u2013 in Q2 a significant dip, people not wanting to hold too many inventories. In Q3, it was just more of a return to \u2013 normalizing that. But the other trend was really the move, I mean, it wasn't COVID related, just weather-related, moving of the fall run. So overall from a COVID recovery, I don't think there's any pent-up demand that we're processing anymore. I think things have largely stabilized. Obviously, when you see the number of cases increasing in the U.S. and globally, that's right now baked into the guidance we've given you, assuming that things don't get remarkably worse or remarkably better. But I think all that's sort of baked in. And as we look into next year, I think it's a little too early for us to really tell exactly what that's going to look like. But I think the key message for us, as you look at our performance and our guidance for the year, is that we've been an incredibly resilient and essential business. And that has really been great for our customers, for our colleagues and for our shareholders. Thanks, David. I'll start with we're not anticipating any combination competition in the U.S. this year or in the first half of next year. As we've talked about many times, we don't have phenomenal intelligence the same way human health does, but we continue to believe that. And to build up on Glenn's comments, as a result, we are investing heavily behind this product in DTC to gain market share as quickly as we can. As we look at sort of the growth, Glenn also mentioned in his remarks that the penetration of clinic is improving, but probably not as great as we would have wanted, given the difficulty in detailing the product in person. However, where we have penetrated, the sales have been much higher. And honestly, we've been cannibalizing Simparica much less than we expected. And we're really seeing is an overall bringing more people in. If you look at flea, tick, heartworm, really only 10% of people who are even taking it are 100% compliant. So we think that remains a significant opportunity for us. And again, we have a strong franchise here across parasiticides and flea, tick, heartworm. And as Glenn also mentioned, we had a 6% share gain in the overall category, which I think is really impressive. So whether that's Simparica, Simparica Trio or ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, we believe we have the portfolio for our customers no matter where they are in the country, how they practice or what their pet owners' needs are. So we continue to believe there'll be strong growth there, and we're going to invest behind this brand next year, while we remain the only triple combination in the U.S. Sure. So thanks, Nathan. I'll start on just looking at the overall market for pain, starting with Librela since it will probably be our first approval there at least in Europe. Pain right now in dogs is around a $400 million market, but there hasn't been significant innovation in that space. And although we do not yet have a label for our product, we believe that a monoclonal antibody will have a strong efficacy as well as safety profile. And we think that we've demonstrated, certainly in derm, our ability to grow the market to really raise awareness, bringing innovation in, brings new customers in and new options. So we do really believe we can continue to do that. If you look at it today, there's about 165 million dogs across the EU and the U.S., and about 40% of them will get OA. And right now, depending on whether in the U.S. or Europe, really diagnosis is somewhere between 25% and 40%. So we do believe there's a significant opportunity to both grow the market as well as bring people in and better diagnose that to really help that. That's really where we see our \u2013 the market on dog. If you focus on cat, we think there's an even bigger market here mostly because many cats are not medicalized today. There are 160 million cats about 40% of them as well have OA. But here, you're really seeing, whether you're in the U.S. or the EU, only about 14% of them being diagnosed. And in the U.S., there really is not an alternative. There really is no pain product for cats. There are a few options in Europe. But we really see this as a significant opportunity and ability to grow the medicalization of cats and really to diagnose pain and to treat it. So we've demonstrated certainly in dermatology our ability to create and to grow markets. And we very much believe across both Librela and [Cylenthia] [ph] in dog and cat that we will have the opportunity to do that. We are not expecting competition at this point, certainly in 2021 from what we understand in this market. So we do believe it's our ability to continue to drive growth and really provide new opportunities for both vets and pet owners to treat pain. Thanks, Ekaterina. What I think we've demonstrated is that overall animal health, and more specifically, pet care is a very resilient industry. And I think what we \u2013 what's probably been a little bit different in COVID, in a pandemic and certainly an economic challenges, people are adopting more pets. And more importantly, they're spending more time at home with those pets. So in a typical year, in the U.S., you'll see about 3.2 million adoptions. We don't have great data yet on what the increase is, but I think anecdotally, no matter where you sit, everyone has a new dog or cat in your neighborhood. So we're definitely seeing, as you look at our vaccine sales, certainly an increase in some of these areas. But I really think what's changing is dogs are becoming a greater part of the family. People are spending more time at home. I don't think that's going to change overnight. And therefore, they're noticing more conditions with their dogs. They're also spending more time at home, seeing our ads and realizing that they're \u2013 if they have a dog who's sick, there is a product for that. So I don't think that trend \u2013 maybe it was more accelerated this year, but I think those dogs and cats are here to stay. I think people will change their behaviors, and some of them, I think, around spending more time with the comfort, be it emotional or otherwise, of pets will continue. And as you look at Europe, your question with regards to COVID in Europe, the data in Europe, as you know, is not as reliable and \u2013 as in the U.S., there's not as many comprehensive data sources. But what we're hearing anecdotally is our customers figured out in Q2 how to continue to see pets through curbside check-ins, and that really hasn't changed. They figured out how to operate, given they're an essential business and we really don't \u2013 we have not seen so far any significant changes. Obviously, there's incremental lockdowns being announced, obviously, in the last 24 to 48 hours in Italy and other places. But as you look at our guidance for the year, unless it gets significantly worse, we think that's baked in. And I think if you look at what we've learned between Q2 and Q3, we think that our customers will be able to manage well as we move into 2021, certainly on the pet care side, to manage continuing to see pets and to diagnose them either through telemedicine or through curbside check-in. So we do believe the trends there are resilient. Sure. I'll start on the diagnostic, on IMAGYST. We are very pleased with how that's going. As you know, the first indication for the IMAGYST, which is an AI-driven diagnostic, is in fecal. That's about a $500 million market, growing about 7%. People are excited at the opportunity for this technology and certainly for additional indications. So we are on track there, and I think we're very pleased with this progress. And given the positive receptivity to it, we are accelerating our investments to bring new indications overall there. And as you look at poultry, certainly in the U.S., there is definitely a rotation, which we always talk about, that was definitely a driver in the quarter, and I think you'll see again moving into Q4. It's also potentially one of the reasons we guided where we did on livestock overall in Q4. Obviously, there's the overall impact to all of the livestock sectors of COVID and less consumption and more dine-in versus dine-out. But poultry specifically, it was more around the rotation there. Sure. I'll start and I'll let Glenn build on this. We were very pleased, obviously, with the growth in China and really the balance between companion animal and livestock there. Certainly, on the livestock side, we are seeing a faster-than-we-expected growth coming back from ASF. But really with the large integrated producers, there's still a significant ASF challenge there. But given the biosecurity of some of them, we are seeing significant growth there. And in companion animal, similar to some trends at other places, is just great growth across the portfolio and strong performance there, certainly on Revolution, launching RIMADYL, just now getting the approval on Simparica. It's more a timing of regulatory on Trio there, but I'll let Glenn get into some specifics on the numbers and the growth. Sure. So digging in a \u2013 first of all, Kathy, great to hear from you. As we look at the pain market for dogs, it's $400 million. If you look at the number of dogs, the EU has 90 million and the U.S. has 75 million. And as you look at, the 40% prevalence of OA is the same across. But in the U.S., really it's only diagnosed about 28% versus 50% in the EU. The only thing we've learned with new technologies is that given we can do direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S., we tend to be able to ramp faster to peak sales when we're launching new technologies in the U.S. than we are able to do in Europe just given we can't do direct-to-consumer advertising that's brand-specific. So I do think we look at how fast can you ramp up that market in Europe. It will be slower than the U.S., what we have in U.S., just given the history. And ultimately, I think we'll do well there. But I think it is a little slower, I would say, overall there. And your second question was around, what was it? And the other thing I'll say, we're still looking at not having competition, so at the earliest the second half of next year. So we're going to, obviously, continue to try to grow those as fast as we can and gain market share. Sure. Starting on DRAXXIN, I mean, it's a little bit hard to tell you exactly what we think the destocking will be. I think given the expectation for many of our customers that they will see significant new generic entrants, I'm sure they will think differently about building inventories ahead of normally what is our price increases in Q1, and that was sort of what Glenn was alluding to earlier. Obviously, we have a robust defense plan for DRAXXIN. It's an important product. We still have \u2013 given its high margin \u2013 significant pricing leverage here. But obviously, we anticipate that some of our customers who would normally stock up at the end of the year ahead of the price increase will not be doing so there. And how high can medicalization rates get for OA? I mean you'd love to believe that all those dogs would be diagnosed. I don't think you're going to really ever get to that exact number. But we try to look at our ability, for example, in derm to try to do that. So we do think there's a significant opportunity, both because they're bringing innovation and we also believe that the anticipated potential safety profile of a mAb will bring more people out that are struggling certainly on the dog side, but definitely on the cat side as well. So I think it's a little too early to say exactly where you can go, but there's a significant opportunity. And we've demonstrated before that we've been able to grow markets as we've entered them with new innovative technologies. Okay. Well, thank you all for your questions and continued interest in Zoetis. We look forward to keeping you updated on our business and continuing to deliver the results and innovations, that you and our customers expect for us. Stay well. Thanks so much."

            "name": "Glenn David",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy during these difficult times, and I thank you for joining us today. We delivered another solid quarter with significant growth in both our companion animal and livestock portfolios. And we continue to be encouraged by the strength and resiliency of our business, despite the challenging environment due to the pandemic. Today, I will provide commentary on our Q3 results, update you on our improved full year 2020 guidance and discuss our expectations for Q4. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $1.8 billion, growing 13% on a reported basis and 15% operationally. Adjusted net income of $524 million was an increase of 15% on a reported basis and 20% operationally. Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue in the quarter by 2%, driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Operational revenue growth was 15% with contributions of 2% from price and 13% from volume. Volume growth of 13% includes 5% from other in-line products, 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 20% operationally with livestock growing 9% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticides portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada and Australia. We also saw growth in our small animal vaccine portfolio and our key dermatology products, Cytopoint and Apoquel. The positive momentum for Simparica Trio continued in the third quarter, and we expect full year incremental revenue of between $125 million to $150 million. As we've previously mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited our ability to visit and penetrate clinics at the rate we had originally expected. However, we are finding that once the clinic has converted to Simparica Trio, the adoption level within the clinic is resulting in meaningful incremental market share. We're also extremely pleased with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio, which in the U.S., gained an additional 6% market share in the flea, tick and heartworm segment for the third quarter versus the same period in the prior year. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $251 million in the quarter, growing 16% operationally and contributing 3% to overall revenue growth. Our diagnostics portfolio also contributed to growth due to the continued recovery of wellness visits following a slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our U.S. cattle business seeing a return to historical distributor buying patterns following the impact of COVID-19 in the second quarter. In addition, the fall cattle run occurred earlier in the year, causing a portion of fourth quarter sales to be pulled forward into the third quarter. And as a result, we expect a significantly weaker fourth quarter in cattle than we typically deliver. For the remaining livestock species, swine returned to growth in the quarter, resulting from expanding herd production in key accounts and increased biosecurity measures in the wake of African Swine Fever in China. We also remain encouraged by the strength of our aquaculture business, which posted a 4th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Poultry declined modestly in the quarter, which partially offset the growth in cattle, swine and fish. New products contributed 4% growth in the quarter, driven by companion animal parasiticides, Simparica Trio, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12. Recent acquisitions contributed 1% of growth this quarter, including our expansion to reference labs and the Platinum Performance nutritionals business. Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 18% with companion animal products growing 21% and livestock sales increasing by 13%. For companion animal, we continued to be encouraged by vet clinic trends with revenue per clinic up 12% in the quarter and demand for our products remaining robust. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We continued to invest in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas, and we have seen a good return on that investment. Simparica Trio continued to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $44 million, despite difficult market conditions for a new product launch. Key dermatology sales were $180 million for the quarter, growing 17%, with significant growth for Cytopoint and Apoquel, resulting from additional patient share and an expanding addressable market. Diagnostic sales increased 28% in the quarter as a result of our reference lab acquisitions and increased point-of-care consumable usage. U.S. livestock grew 13% in the quarter, driven primarily by cattle. As I mentioned, purchasing patterns returned to historical levels, and we saw earlier movement from pasture to feedlot both contributing to a significant volume increase for our products. To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a difficult market environment. We remain enthusiastic about the recovery and trends we're observing in companion animal products. While livestock delivered an exceptional third quarter, as we've indicated in the past, we do not expect a sustainable recovery until the middle of 2021. Revenue in our International segment grew 11% operationally in the quarter with growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which was flat in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 20% operationally and livestock revenue grew 6% operationally. Increased sales in companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and our key dermatology products. Parasiticide growth in the quarter was driven by the Simparica franchise, including the continued adoption of Simparica Trio, as well as increased promotional activity for Revolution. In the EU, limited access to veterinary clinics due to COVID-19 restrictions presented challenges for companion animal product sales in the second quarter, but in the third quarter we saw pent-up demand begin to work its way through the system, particularly for small animal vaccines. Companion animal diagnostics grew 17% in the quarter led by an increase in point-of-care consumable usage. International livestock growth in the quarter was driven by swine, fish and cattle. Swine delivered another strong quarter with 16% operational revenue growth, primarily driven by China, which grew 159%. While a significant portion of China's growth reflects the impact of African swine fever in the prior year, we're continuing to see expansion in our key accounts as production shifts from smaller forms to large scale operations. Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 10% operationally, driven by an increase in market share in vaccines and the acquisition of Fish Vet Group. Overall, our International segment delivered strong results and was a key contributor to revenue growth with significant growth in companion animal, swine and fish. We are also encouraged to see cattle return to growth in what are still difficult market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 69.6% fell 50 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of negative FX, the manufacturing costs and recent acquisitions. This was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally, resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio and Apoquel. We have strategically reallocated savings, mainly from T&E costs into these high return promotional programs, which have been successful in increasing sales. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, a decrease of 50 basis points, driven by the impact of net discrete tax benefits. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 20% operationally primarily driven by revenue growth, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 21% operationally. The strength of our balance sheet, along with the significant free cash flow we generate, has enabled us to execute on our investment priorities including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development. While we suspended our share repurchase program for the last 2 quarters to preserve cash during the pandemic, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend. In addition, share repurchases are a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy and we'll continue to evaluate the appropriate time to resume the program. Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2020. We are raising guidance for a second consecutive quarter as a result of our third quarter performance and the improving companion animal market environment. While the COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges and risks, we remain confident in the resiliency and durability of our diverse portfolio. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October. For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $6.55 billion and $6.625 billion and operational revenue growth of between 7% and 8% for the full year versus the 3% to 6% in our August guidance. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $1.79 billion to $1.825 billion representing operational growth of 6% to 8% compared to our prior guidance of 1% to 5%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.76 to $3.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.38 to $3.45. We are anticipating a deceleration of revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting from weaker performance in our livestock business. The impact will filter down to adjusted net income, which will also be affected by increased expense as we invest in future revenue growth. In addition, adjusted net income has a difficult comparative period as a result of nonrecurring discrete tax benefits recorded in Q4 2019. In closing, we delivered another strong quarter, demonstrating the resiliency of our business, even in these challenging market conditions. I'd like to once again express how extremely proud we are of our colleagues, and the commitment they have demonstrated towards our customers and our company. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Sure. So I'll take both of those questions, Erin, thank you. In terms \u2013 I'll address the mix dynamics first. Nothing has changed really in terms of the underlying dynamics. A couple of factors related to the gross margin. A, foreign exchange was particularly unfavorable in this quarter, so that led to a step-up, a little bit in cost of goods, so that lowered the overall gross margin percentage. Also, we continued to invest in some of the new areas for growth, such as reference labs and some of the acquisitions, which also has a lower gross margin profile than our core business. But in terms of the underlying dynamics for companion animal and continued growth there being \u2013 continue to be an overall benefit for gross margin. But the FX as well as some of the investments we're making in newer businesses such as reference labs did have a negative impact. In terms of the guidance for Q4 and the implied step-down in revenue, a couple of key factors there. A, U.S. cattle being one of the larger ones. We had a very strong quarter in U.S. cattle in Q3, really driven by 2 factors. A, the acceleration of the fall cattle run bringing some sales from Q4 into Q3. As well as a normalization of buying patterns in Q3 that resulted in some incremental sales that we did not expect to repeat in Q4. The other thing to consider for U.S. cattle in Q4 is the impact of DRAXXIN LOE in 2021. We do anticipate that some of our customers may change their buying patterns for Q4, which could result in less sales. As I mentioned, there are impacts beyond just revenue for Q4. Really, the adjusted effective tax rate is a big driver from an income growth perspective. We had a very favorable tax rate in Q4 of last year that will not repeat this year and will have a negative impact on our overall income growth. Sure, Jon. So, I'll take the DRAXXIN question. So as you mentioned, DRAXXIN is a very large product in animal health, over $300 million, a large product for us as well. Because of that, we do expect to see significant generic competition and a number of manufacturers being prepared with a generic product. So we do typically see a 20% to 40% impact over time, once a product faces generic competition. Because of the size of DRAXXIN, we do expect that, that will occur over a little more rapid period than we've seen in the past with some smaller products Yeah, Mike, in terms of the increased spending in the quarter, so as you mentioned, we did increase spending in Q3 with total OpEx up about 9%, and SG&A up 11%. And really, what we did there is we took a lot of the savings that we saw from T&E and made incremental investments behind some of our key growth brands, particularly Simparica Trio and Apoquel in the tune of DTC advertising, which was even greater than the savings that we saw from a T&E perspective, because we believe those are the right investments, and we're seeing a very strong return on those, to support the future growth of the brands. In terms of what you mentioned for Q4 that the EPS gap between revenue and EPS, the gap there being driven by OpEx, obviously, the bigger driver there actually is more related to what I mentioned in terms of the change in the tax rate quarter-over-quarter and the incremental interest expense. It's really not that OpEx. It's disproportionate to revenues. The changes that we're seeing year-over-year, just based on some quarterly fluctuations in the tax rate as well as the incremental interest expense that we're going to see in Q4 based on the funding that we did earlier this year. Yeah. So in terms of 2021, Louise, obviously, we will be providing guidance for 2021 in February as we typically do. A couple of things to think about, right, the long-term fundamentals of the industry remain very strong with increasing pet ownership and also animal protein consumption continuing to grow. I think the other thing to think about for 2021, I think COVID has proven that this industry remains extremely resilient and we're still able to grow very rapidly, operate very profitably even during these times. Looking into 2021, there are some things that we're very excited about. Obviously, the continued growth that we expect to see in Trio, continued growth of our derm portfolio, and obviously, the approval of our mAb portfolio and the launch within the EU coming in the first half of the year that Kristin mentioned. Some of the things that may be a headwind, obviously, are the DRAXXIN LOE. But again, with the growth that we expect to see in some of the other brands that we've mentioned, we do expect that for 2021 we'll be able to continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition of growing faster than the overall market. And in terms of the diagnostic growth. So if you look at companion animal diagnostic growth for the quarter, we grew about 24%. Backing out the impact of reference labs, that growth was around 13%. So we saw very strong growth in our consumable usage. Obviously, our instrument revenue was down as it's been a little more challenging to get into the clinics took place new instruments, but very strong performance in our overall consumable revenue growth. In terms of the benefit that we've seen in the usage of both the reference labs and the point-of-care together, we are very early in our reference labs strategy. We are looking to build out a network across the U.S., but that will take some time. So we're still early on in that build-out. Yeah. So just, again, to the details of the number. As you mentioned, overall, China for the quarter grew 63%. We saw 52% growth in companion animal and we saw 81% growth in livestock. And that 81% growth in livestock was driven by swine. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, swine grew 159% in China for the quarter. As we've continued to see the recovery in some of our key accounts and the larger producers, we've seen very strong performance of our products within those accounts. Around derm. So in terms of the opportunity for derm, so we continue to see really strong performance in the derm portfolio. We grew 16% this quarter with 21% growth year-to-date. In terms of the continued opportunity for growth, we see opportunities for growth in both the U.S. and International. So looking at the U.S., currently, there are about 75 million dogs in the U.S. and about 14 million dogs have itchiness. Of those 14 million dogs, today about 60% are treated. So there is still 40% of the dogs with itchiness that are not treated. So we do think there is an opportunity to continue to raise awareness of the disease state and get those itchy dogs continue to take Apoquel or Cytopoint. When you look outside of the U.S., we also see a big opportunity for growth. In terms of the breakout of our sales today, about two-thirds of our sales are U.S. and one-third is International. However, the number of itchy dogs is similar between those segments. So to the extent that we're able to continue to drive that adoption and awareness, we do believe that there is continued growth expected in the International markets as well. Yeah, thanks, Michael. So in terms of share repurchase, we don't have any specific timeline. Obviously, it's something that we'll continue to evaluate. There's still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace, particularly around COVID-19 and the timing that we expect to see a full recovery. So that's one of the factors that we'll continue to evaluate. One thing I'll say though is our capital allocation priorities have not changed, right, in terms of investing in the business as our first priority. And I think you see us doing a lot of that this year, even in light of COVID, particularly with the investments that we're making in DTC, the investments that we're making in R&D to continue to support the medium, short and long term growth of this company, also significant investments that we're making in manufacturing to ensure continuity of supply, and also investments that we're making from an inventory perspective, again, to ensure continuity of supply. So we are really focusing on some of those internal investments. We've also been able to execute on some business development deals throughout this year as well even with the limitations that may be provided by COVID, but really good use of our capital across all areas. Yeah, so just to clarify, that was based on the U.S. market size of around $2.5 billion. And the second question was around Apoquel for the quarter \u2013 for Trio, I'm sorry. So, the Trio for the quarter, we did $50 million in sales for Trio for the quarter."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteven Frank: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Zoetis\u2019 second quarter 2020 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 6, 2020. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect all of our professional and personal lives. On the call today, we will provide additional context around the impact of COVID-19 is having on our business, summarize the quarterly financial results, update you on our outlook and leave plenty of time to address your questions. In the second quarter, we delivered better than expected results given uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. And I want to thank all of our Zoetis colleagues, who have shown amazing resiliency, customer focus and perseverance throughout the year and our response to these challenging times. In terms of numbers, our revenue grew 4% operationally with the U.S. segment up 6% and international up 3%. Our companion animal products continue to drive our business performance with 13% operational growth, livestock products declined 5%. Our adjusted net income increased 4% operationally in the second quarter. We have built a very strong companion animal portfolio over the last several years based on our internal innovation. And these products have helped offset some of the deeper market challenges in the livestock market today. Our recently launched parasiticide compared to Trio, ProHeart 12 and Revolution Plus as well as our key dermatology portfolio of Apoquel and CytoPoint provides us solid foundation that has continued to form well this year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new triple combination parasiticide for dogs Simparica Trio, as well as the strength of the overall Simparica franchise. Glenn will share more details in his remarks. Our continued focus on meaningful innovations and the diversity of our portfolio across PCs, products and geographies remain core advantages for Zoetis during times of economic uncertainty and we've also seen the essential nature of animal health playing an important role in the resiliency of our business and our industry at this time. In terms of COVID-19, our veterinary and producer customers are under increased pressure to deliver critical animal care and maintain a reliable global food supply and we are fortunate to be able to support them in this mission. We continue to put the safety of our colleagues and customers first during this pandemic. And we're very pleased with our team's ability to maintain productivity, even with safety and social distancing adjustments at our facilities, as well as the ongoing use of remote work arrangements for the majority of our colleagues. Our field force has returned to meeting with customers in many geographies based on local guidance and practices. We monitor and adapt these plans on a daily basis based on local feedback and adjustments in markets that may be experiencing increased COVID-19 cases. Our teams are excited to be back out with our customers, but we're also preserving the lessons we have learned from effective online interactions, webinars, and e-commerce to evolve our sales and support. In terms of supply chain, Zoetis has maintained a reliable inventory of critical medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to our customers and distributors in more than a hundred markets around the world. And our research development programs remain on track in terms of filings clinical trials and interactions with regulatory agencies. We remain confident in the progress of regulatory reviews of our monoclonal antibody candidates for pain in cats and dogs. Our submissions are proceeding as expected. This year continues to be uncharted territory due to COVID-19 and the related trends affecting our customers. However, the underlying demand for healthy pets and a reliable source of protein remains fundamental to the global economy. In the second quarter, we benefited from the veterinary clinics in the U.S. recovering much more quickly from the COVID-19 impact than we anticipated. Veterinary practices in the U.S. adapted quickly the Cribb site visits and mobile clinics to deliver critical care and maintain relationships with our customers. We also saw an acceleration of companion animal product sales through e-commerce channels as a result of the lockdowns in many States. Veterinarians and pet owners are adapting more quickly to these online options as a way to fill prescriptions for parasiticides and other medicines. We also know people are spending more time at home with their pets. They may be observing conditions such as itchiness or pain, which has previously gone unnoticed. And so, we're actually seeing an increase in spend per visit in U.S. clinics. Meanwhile, outside the U.S., companion animal veterinary clinic performance has been in line with expectations despite wide market by market variations based on local dynamics. For Zoetis, we expect our overall revenue growth for the remainder of the year to be driven largely by companion animal products, especially our parasiticide and key dermatology portfolio. We plan to continue investing in direct to consumer advertising and digital marketing to support these products. Livestock is a very different picture and remains very challenged by the pandemic, especially in the U.S. Producers are adjusting to new market demands and distribution needs from food service and restaurant channels to more grocery and retail channels while also managing ongoing labor, safety and trade issues. As expected, U.S. livestock in the second quarter saw a significant downturn as we expect that to remain a challenge for the rest of the year. The pace of return to more food service and restaurant demand along with increased export opportunities will be the most significant factors in the recovery of livestock producers in the U.S. Internationally, livestock grew and performed in line with expectations across a diverse set of markets. We saw very positive results in places like China, where they're further along in their COVID-19 recovery, but we will be sensitive to see how Latin America and markets like Brazil perform in the remainder of the year due to COVID. As you look ahead, we remain focused on advancing our five key priorities to ensure our long-term success: driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. We've continued to make important investments in products and innovations across the continuum of care from prediction and prevention to detection and treatment of disease. Supporting successful launches as well as new life cycle innovations and expansions of major products into new markets continue to be the cornerstones of our durable and steady performance. In the second quarter, we expanded major vaccine franchises with the approval of our Vanguard B Oral for dogs in Brazil and our Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCV Metastim for vaccines for pigs in Australia. We also continue to strengthen our diagnostic and digital capabilities building on recent acquisitions in point-of-care and reference labs along with additional investment. We plan to launch a new diagnostic platform for pet care in the third quarter called VETSCAN IMAGYST. We are very excited about the potential for this disruptive innovation, which will be the first systems to bring clinical pathology right to the point-of-care. This new multi-purpose platform uses a combination of image recognition technology, algorithms and cloud-based artificial intelligence to deliver rapid testing results to the clinic. Its first indication will be for testing fecal samples for parasites, making it quick and easy to test and treat pets in the same visit. We will have more to say in the coming weeks as we prepare for a global launch. We also view diagnostics is playing an important role in the continuum of care for fish. In the second quarter, we acquired Fish Vet Group to add more diagnostic tools to our aquaculture portfolio, including environmental testing, which is critical to fish farming. Finally, at Zoetis our key priority around high performing teams is tied to creating a culture where all colleagues feel valued and included and is reflected in our commitment to promoting inclusion, diversity and equity across our organization. Our leadership and board are dedicated to being a force for positive change across the globe to drive greater equity and inclusion. And we have dedicated financial and people resources to do so. As part of this plan, we have made commitments to publish our diversity statistics and to increase our representation of black colleagues and people of color overall in the U.S. As the world leader in animal health, we are committed to demonstrating our leadership on this important business and social issue. Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our second quarter results and updated guidance for the full year. Glenn?\nGlenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and adapting to what is certainly an unprecedented time for all of us. Today, we'll provide additional commentary on our Q2 financial results, provide an update on our liquidity position and review our improved full year 2020 guidance. Beginning with the second quarter results, we generated revenue of $1.5 billion, which was flat on a reported basis and 4% growth operationally. Adjusted net income of $427 million, decreased 2% on a reported basis and increased 4% operationally. Foreign exchange in the quarter had an unfavorable impact of 4% on revenue. This was driven primarily by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and euro. Operational revenue growth at 4% was driven by 2% price and 2% volume. Volume growth. 2% includes 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 5% in other inline products.  Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 13% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally. Companion animal performance was driven by a parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., Canada and certain European markets and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint.  Revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance, and its nutritional products acquired in the second half of 2019, drove the growth in equine. Livestock declines in the quarter were driven by challenges to our U.S. livestock portfolio. Supply chain disruptions caused by reduced animal processing capacity and shifting consumer demand from restaurant and food service to grocery stores effected our customers' purchasing decisions. This decline was partially offset by strong performance internationally with growth in swine, fish and poultry. New products contributed 3% to overall growth in the quarter driven by Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12, Revolution Plus and our Alpha Flux parasiticides for salmon in Chile. We remain excited by the launch of Simparica Trio and are reaffirming the range of a $100 million to $125 million for full year incremental revenue. While vet clinic penetration is occurring at a more moderate pace as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, prescriptions in those clinics that have adopted Trio have been more robust and cannibalization of Simparica has been less than we anticipated.  Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $224 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally and contributing 3% overall revenue growth. Recent acquisitions contributed 1% growth this quarter, which includes Platinum Performance and our reference lab expansion strategy.  Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segments for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 6% with companion animal products growing 19% and livestock products declining by 18%. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of Simparica franchise, our key dermatology products and the impact of recent acquisitions. U.S. key dermatology sales were $160 million for the quarter, growing 26%. The continued strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of both CytoPoint and Apoquel benefiting from our direct-to-consumer campaign, uptick in e-commerce channels and pet owners spending more time with their pets as a result of COVID-19. Simparica Trio performed well in the U.S. with sales of $36 million, despite challenging market conditions in Q2. We\u2019re observing several positive trends, included rapid uptake in clinic that have adopted Trio smaller than expected cannibalization of Simparica. Sales coming from new patients for the category and taking share from current oral flea and tick competitors. Diagnostic sales increased 18% in the quarter, largely driven by our reference lab acquisitions. In addition, previous instrument placements created a solid foundation for consumables growth in the second quarter. U.S. livestock declined 18% in the quarter driven by lower sales across all species. In the second quarter, we faced challenges with significant declines in feedlot placements, reduced demand from the food service industry and the effects that had throughout the food supply chain and our customers, in addition to increased competition. To summarize, U.S. performance was strong in a difficult market environment. And the diversity of our portfolio, again, proved beneficial as growth in companion animal offset the challenges faced in the U.S. by our livestock portfolio.  Our international segment had operational revenue growth of 3% in the second quarter with more balanced performance across our companion animal and livestock portfolios. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 2% and livestock operational growth was 4%. Increase sales in companion animal products with a result of growth in our key dermatology portfolio and our Simparica franchise, including the launch of Simparica Trio in Canada.  While European markets were impacted significantly by COVID-19, the decline was offset by significant growth in other markets, including Japan and China. Diagnostics had a difficult quarter as wide-scale clinic closures resulting from COVID-19, limited the ability to place the instruments and negatively impacted consumable usage.  International livestock growth in the quarter was driven by swine, fish and poultry. Swine grew double digits in the quarter, primarily driven by China, which grew 25% as key accounts continue to expand their herds and production shifts from smaller farms to larger scale operations.  Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter. We saw favorable conditions in Chile and Norway that resulted in vaccinations being accelerated into Q2. In addition, we continue to see an uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile. Overall, our international segment was again, a positive contributor to revenue growth with performance in swine, companion animal, fish, and poultry, more than offsetting declining cattle resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 71.1%, increased slightly on a reported basis compared to the prior year due to price, favorable manufacturing costs and product mix, which were partially offset by foreign exchange, recent acquisitions and higher inventory charges. Adjusted operating expenses were flat operationally. The incremental advertising and promotion expense is related to Simparica Trio, recent acquisitions and R&D increases were largely offset by reductions to T&E and compensated related costs as a result of COVID-19.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%. The increase versus prior year is driven by the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recorded in Q2 2019. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 4% operationally, primarily driven by revenue growth and adjusted diluted EPS grew 6% operationally.  Next, I'd like to cover our liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the second quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including the proceeds from our $1.25 billion long-term debt issuance in May, of which $500 million is earmarked for repayment of our November 2020 maturity. We have access to a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a coinciding commercial paper program, both of which remain undrawn. Given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities for internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Consistent with what I mentioned last quarter, we still anticipate elevated capital expenditures this year to support investments in manufacturing, information technology to support our recent acquisitions and capabilities in digital and data analytics.  With regard to returning excess cash to shareholders, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend, which represents a 22% increase over 2019. In Q1, we repurchased $250 million in Zoetis shares before suspending the program in the second quarter in order to conserve cash. We have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our multi-year share repurchase program.  Now moving on to our updated guidance assumptions for 2020. Our cash performance has always given us confidence that the essential nature of our business, a diverse portfolio and the innovation we consistently bring to our customers would position us well during difficult market conditions. After assessing recent trends and our performance in the second quarter, we're further refining and raising our full year 2020 guidance. We expect recent positive companion animal trends in the U.S. will continue. Although vet clinic revenue may moderate somewhat as pent-up demand works its way through the system. Alternatively, we believe social distancing measures are negatively impacting the food service recovery and will continue to present challenges to our livestock business in the U.S. The more recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S. and expanding rates of infection in international markets continues to create uncertainty around the duration, scope and economic impact of the pandemic.  Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July and given our global footprint, movement in foreign exchange has had an impact on revenue and adjusted net income since we issued our prior guidance in May.  Our current guidance includes favorable foreign exchange at revenue of approximately $50 million and approximately $10 million at adjusted net income versus May guidance.  For revenue, we're raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $6.3 billion and $6.475 billion and operational revenue growth of between 3% and 6% for the full year versus the negative 2% to positive 3% we had in our May guidance.  Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of between $1.685 billion and $1.765 billion, representing operational growth, a positive 1% to positive 5% compared to our prior guidance of negative 9% to negative 3%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.68 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.14 to $3.32. In closing, while the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly presented a set of challenges we have not seen in the past. We're extremely proud of our colleagues and the commitment they have shown toward our customers, our company, and animal healthcare.  During this time, we have demonstrated the diversity and durability of our portfolio, the resiliency of our industry, and we have confidence in our ability to continue to execute on our strategy during these uncertain times. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nQ - Jon Block: Great. Thanks guys. I guess, I'll try to just load everything upfront. Glenn, I think op margins were at an all-time high in the midst of a global pandemic, so congrats. But some of that was likely eaten by mix. Yet, it seems like that mix may remain, as you mentioned, intact or favorable for the next couple of quarters. So as we think about margins into the back part of the year, is there anything to call out overall? And what about the cadence of 3Q versus 4Q?  Kristin, for you, just to shift over there, maybe if you can just talk to what you're seeing for a competitive response on Trio. And just a clarification, the new platform for diagnostics of the new offering is that in a new VetScan analyzer that displaces the old one? Or is it a different unit specific for pathology? A lot there. But thanks for your time.\nGlenn David: So Jon, I'll address the first part of your question with operating margins and mix. So as you say, we have very favorable gross margin in this quarter as well as the first half of the year. As we look into the second half of the year, we do expect there to be some deterioration in gross margin. And that does come from product mix, right? The separation that we've seen in performance in the quarter, livestock declined 5% operationally. Companion animal growth grew 13%. We expect that to narrow in the second half of the year, the differential in performance between companion animal and livestock. So that will negatively impact mix.  The other component is that we generally have a larger portion of livestock sales in the second half of the year than we do have in the first half of the year. The other component to consider is OpEx. As we move into the second half of the year and our field returns more and more to visiting clinics, T&E expenses, which has been very favorable, particularly in Q2, will rise as we go into Q3 and Q4. In terms of the dynamics between Q3 and Q4, don't really see any big differential in terms of the dynamics between Q3 and Q4.\nKristin Peck: Okay. Hey Jon. With regards to your question on competitive response to Trio. It's been the response that we largely expected. Obviously, this is an innovative product. They were very aware it was coming. They're obviously running promotions. You probably saw some stock-ins as we probably saw as you move from Q1 to Q2, but we're really not seeing anything that we weren't expecting overall.  And to address your other question with regards to images, it's a completely separate product. It is actually a scanner and a microscope that then uploads to the cloud for analysis. So it is completely separate than VetScan. And it's a platform. And the first product, as we mentioned, will be around fecal, but it is not a replacement at all of the VetScan machine. It's a separate one that is both a scanner and a microscope.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJon Kaufman: Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. I'd like to focus a little bit on livestock here. It'd be great to get a sense of your expectation for what the outlook looks like, not just in the coming quarter or two, but really into 2021 and over the medium term. So I guess a couple of questions within that. First, how much of a residual impact will the processing capacity issues have?  And then second, on the lower foodservice demand, let's just say, hypothetically, the U.S. consumer really isn't ready to go out to restaurants until spring or summer of 2021, do you expect producers to exit and then you're serving a smaller end market? Or is it more of producers realize this is a period of limited profitability, but they don't adjust herd sizes and they stay in the market? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Jon. A few things on that. I think the two big trends you're seeing in U.S. livestock \u2013 and I\u2019d say you have to look at livestock. 50% of our livestock business is actually outside the U.S. and it grew at 4%. So again, this speaks to the diversity of our portfolio. But if you look at the sort of global trends you're talking about with regards to the movement from eating out to eating in, we do expect that to continue. And the guidance we've given for the rest of the year is that, that largely doesn't change too dramatically. It's obviously too early to tell in 2021 how that ultimately adjusts.  The second factor to consider in the livestock overall is the packing plants, which have been an issue in the U.S. Packing plant capacity in the U.S. still looks to be about 95% to 97%. And in some businesses, that may be good, but that does continue to back up animals. But again, this is mostly a U.S. trend, although we have seen a few isolated issues outside of the U.S. and Europe, Australia and some other markets.  But again, I think what producers are doing are doing their best to actually alter where they can the flow of animals. This is much easier for poultry to do, given they only have to make decisions on 45 days. Pigs can do it over six months. So I think you will see a slight reduction in the U.S. in pork. It is much harder for cattle producers. Most of those animals are already here. So we do see cattle probably continuing to struggle probably through the first half of next year.  But I think the third factor besides the dine in, dine out and packing plants to consider is actually the export market. What has really helped maintain a lot of the lot of the U.S. livestock flows has been the export market, with the largest player there clearly being China. And given ASF, they are still in need of a tremendous amount of pork. So those are the three factors that we're considering that gives us confidence that, to your question, in the short to medium term.  In general, livestock has grown around 5%. Obviously, it's been a little lower in the last few years. And I think, again, International was 4%. We were negative in the U.S. We do think in the medium term it goes back to normal levels, but we do think livestock will continue to be challenged certainly this year and likely at least to the first half of next year. Thanks, Jon. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. \nMichael Ryskin: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just two sort of quick ones for me. First, on the guide, for revenues and guidance of 3% to 6% core growth. I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. Because you did 4% in the second quarter, you're over 5% year-to-date. Over end of the range actually impose pretty meaningful deceleration from the second quarter, and yet most trends are pointing upwards.  So I'm just wondering if you could go into that sort of what points you to 3%, what points you to 6%. When you guided in the first quarter you talked about a second wave in the fall and winter. Is something like that in your assumptions now? Or is there anything underlying going on there?  And then the second question, again, on the digital VetScan pathology instrument you talked about. Just a little bit of a follow-up. Is it an instrument-only product? Will there be consumables attached to it. And are you planning any different rollout in U.S. versus international? Thanks.\nGlenn David: So Mike, just in terms of your first question in terms of the guidance in revenue of the 34% to 6% growth. So to your point, in the first half, we grew 5% with a limited impact from COVID-19 in Q1. That would imply a second half of 2% to 7% growth essentially. I think, a, it's first important to understand that, in the first half, that 5% growth did have a contribution from acquisitions of about 1%, which we won't have that same contribution in the second half of the year because of when the timing of those acquisitions occurred last year. So that really brings you to organic growth of about 4% in the first half of the year, which is the real comparator for that implied 2% to 7% growth in the second half of the year.  So really pretty balanced between first half and second half organically with the first quarter not really having a significant impact from COVID-19. To your question about what brings you to the low end of the range, that would be a more would be a more severe impact of COVID-19 than we're seeing today across our markets. What takes you to the higher end of that range is things sort of stabilizing as they are for the rest of the year without a more rapid or more significant impact of COVID-19.\nKristin Peck: Sure. And to take the second half of your question, Mike, on images, we will be launching the U.S. and a few markets outside of the U.S. as we move into the end of Q3 to Q4. And there are consumables, but the consumable \u2013 the consumables, obviously, reagents there, but there's also a read. So obviously, with every test that's done, the read that's done in the cloud is also a fee. So there are both \u2013 some products to use to prepare the specimen. But there's also \u2013 more importantly, the read of each test in the cloud. So it's a consumable, I suppose, but it's almost like a different way of looking at it, which is a cost per read. I hope that answers it. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: [Indiscernible] for Chris. Thank you for taking the questions. The first one is on African Swine Fever. You've touched upon this in your prepared remarks, but talk about where we are in terms of the recovery in China. How much of the herd has been rebuilt? And would you expect this to represent a tailwind in the second half of the year?  And then another one on livestock. It seems a part of the dynamic that COVID is creating is producers switching to lower-cost alternatives. To what extent is this happening? And how sticky do you think this dynamic is as we think about recovery in 2021 and beyond. Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. So Sure. So we'll start with your question with regard to African Swine Fever in China. What we've been seeing in China overall is that the larger, more sophisticated integrated producers are starting to rebuild their herd. As you saw, very strong growth in our China business of 24%. What you're seeing underlying this is the beginning of the rebuild of these herds. This is more isolated to sophisticated producers who can ensure biosecurity. Because to be clear, there's still African Swine Fever present in China. So I think what you're seeing is some of the smaller backyard producers are not rebuilding there, but we are seeing some of the more sophisticated ones doing so. And that is a positive trend for us because they would be more likely to use our products overall. But if you look at African Swine Fever, we are still predicting that China will have to continue to import pork a significant amount for the next few years.  So this rebuild is slow because, as I said, there is still African Swine Fever in China in a few isolated markets as well outside of China. So I suppose, if you look at that, for China, it will continue to be a tailwind for us, continuing to drive the China business as that herd rebuild.  And with regard to your second question on livestock and whether we're \u2013 some people are switching to lower-cost alternatives. Historically, that has been the case. So people will trade down. What's slightly different is that this is a pandemic with a recession. And I say that because, as long as there's more protein than people need, the price goes down. So hamburger meat right now is actually still pretty cheap.  So historically, we would've seen a recession. People trade down from beef to pork to chicken\u2019s egg. So we think that's still a longer-term trend. But with the disruption right now and the overcapacity, you are still seeing some other proteins still in certain markets on a relative basis not be that expensive. So I think it's \u2013 I would say your overall hypothesis over the medium to long term is true, although in certain markets, given overcapacity, the difference in price is not as dramatic as it normally is.\nOperator: And we'll take our \u2013 next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you how COVID-19 has changed the way you do business on both the livestock and companion animal side? What efficiencies have emerged? And what could be here to stay? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Louise. I think, similar to all businesses, we are \u2013 we've had to adjust the way we operate, and I've been incredibly impressed as the resilience of our colleagues and our customers and their creativity. So the first trend is we've obviously moved a lot more to doing virtual seminars or webinars to handling orders and things like that by phone. Our customers have adapted to more telemedicine in certain markets around the world. And if you look at more broadly in the U.S. and in certain markets outside the U.S. to e-commerce. So that is obviously for us, it's supporting our producers, our veterinarians and pet owners to make sure they can access our products wherever they our products wherever they need. But I think some of the skills that our field force is now learning will be one that will help us in the future, obviously reduces some of the travel that some of them had to do.  But our field force across the world, where businesses are allowing, are actually back seeing customers. Now it's not as many customers as they saw before in a day, and that has to be both a customer and a colleague feeling comfortable in a given market. But it also has to flex, obviously, given some of the flare-ups in the U.S. geographically and across the world, a lot more flexibility there. So I think it's both our customers getting creative and flexible and our field force and some of our capabilities overall as the company to be able to meet our customers where they are. So I think I'm quite impressed at how our colleagues and our customers have adopted.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Westenberg from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a great quarter. So for my first question, are you anticipating any kind of competitive launch in the derm in the next year, say, 2021? I know we've heard about potential competitive launches for five \u2013 probably five years now, but this time it kind of feels a little bit different. And then for my second question is on the diagnostic platform. Is there any limitation to the sample type, say blood fecal, urine even maybe physical tissue, et cetera? And is there a component that might have a reagent to it? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Sure, so I'll start David with your first question on the Durham portfolio. We were obviously quite pleased with its performance in the quarter, growing 24%. This is now obviously a blockbuster products as well as category. And to your point, we have expected competition for a while given the attractiveness of the sector. At this point in time, as you know \u2013 we have very intelligence, as you know, in our industry with regards to competitive launches, but based on what we know today, we are not expecting a competitive launch in the rest of 2020 and likely the first half of 2021. Obviously that's always subject to change since we don't know exactly what our competitors are doing, but we continue to believe that we will have competition in the space, but we, at this point, do not believe it's in the next 6 to 12 months. So our focus right now on our Durham portfolio is building those brands as big as we can. And if you saw in the quarter, our focus on direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. to continue to grow our share and to build the market itself. So your second question with regards to the platform, the images platform, what we're saying is it's the first fecal will be the first. Obviously, it could look at lots of others. I mean that's still \u2013 product that is still in our research and development to look at other types such as obviously blood and other types. But those are not things we are prepared at this point to discuss, but obviously the platform lends itself to be able to do multiple different tissue types. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Balaji Prasad from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. So two parts. Firstly, Kristin, there's a material change in the competitive landscape with a new number two company. So I would like to understand your thoughts on what the Elanco and Bayer merger means for the industry and for Zoetis specifically as the number one company. Secondly, you've been championing technology adoption of the firm. So I want to explore one of the priority areas, you mentioned, digital and data analytics. And what does that mean in actual terms is the revenue driver is an operational efficiency measure or a mix of both? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Balaji. For starters on the combination of Elanco and Bayer, as we said previously, we don't really see this as changing the competitive landscape in any dramatic way. We've competed against both of them many times before. Obviously, the acquisition of Bayer by Elanco will increase their business in the OTC space, where we honestly don't really operate. We do in the direct-to-consumer side, but not in the over-the-counter. So it's not a space that's important to us, especially with our focus on the veterinarian where that's more of a retail market there. So we don't foresee that changing it. They're both been well-capitalized competitors historically, so we don't see that as a major change. With regards to digital and data analytics, I think, it's an - and it is both a revenue driver as we announced today with IMAGYST certainly looking at products that drive revenues, such as platforms, such as vet. We've also spoken about precision livestock farming. So there's a numbers of ways in both companion animal and livestock that this continues to help us drive revenue in, but it's also an area where we can also be much more efficient, better targeting our customers, looking at new ways through e-commerce and other channels. We've done some quite exciting things. In China, for example, launching our own revolution page there and leveraging different tools in digital and data to just also make us more efficient, so to drive revenue and just increase our efficiency. So I think it is a \u2013 it's both. Thanks, Balaji.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to start with Simparica Trio. You mentioned the clinic penetration is occurring, I think, at a more moderate pace than what you initially anticipated. Kristin, it'd just be great to get your view on kind of what you've seen so far and maybe what factors have had the biggest impact on pace of uptake? And do you think that we'll see the typical seasonality that you usually see in the parasiticide business, obviously a lot different about this year than maybe past year? And then the second question, if I could just ask it upfront. On the vet channel overall, how much of the strength do you think kind of might be backlog or pent-up demand versus what might be, excuse me, more sustainable as we think about trends in that part of your business over the balance of the year?\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Nathan. So as we look at Trio, we started shipping the distribution in late March and launched the product in April, right and probably the height of the pandemic at least in the U.S. What we've seen to date is that \u2013 that was more difficult for clinics to take on new products. That's often something that requires an in-person meeting and training of staff, et cetera. So we saw a slight \u2013 versus what we expected fewer penetration of clinics, but what we've been incredibly pleased about and why we've given the guidance of $100 million to 125 million, is that for the \u2013 we've been quite successful in corporate accounts ones that we engage quite early on this larger clinics and the ones we penetrated, our share in those clinics has grown faster than we expected. So I think that's been a positive. So I \u2013 again, we're continuing to grow our penetration of clinics, but we're quite pleased with the share. And what we're also pleased about is it's had less of an impact certainly in cannibalizing Simparica, which has been great. So we've certainly taken share from others, but our data also suggests we're also bringing new people back to the category of oral parasiticides, which we think is pretty exciting there. So, I think \u2013 whether this will be a typical season, if you look at some of the data with regards to vet visits Q2 year-over-year, they're still down, I think, about 3%, but it's a significant improvement from the negative 20 to negative 30 you saw it in the U.S. in the beginning of the quarter. But what's really interesting and what might affect your second \u2013 your question there is that the spend per visit, however, is up dramatically. So, latest data, we'll say it's maybe up about 7%. We do think that's going to moderate over time. This is probably people buying more of the products so they don't have to return to the vet in case there's something. So we do expect that to moderate some in the coming quarters, but that might mean that people may versus the normal \u2013 historical six months, six or so \u2013 six or seven months of buying the parasiticides, maybe they bought more. So we'll see that that goes, but we are expecting that to moderate. So I think, overall, we're looking for continued positive trends in companion animal, but I think it will be dependent on geography by geography.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nKathy Miner: Thank you. Good morning. I have two questions. First, just going back to the dermatology business given that you talked about the trends were good and people are staying home with their pets more. Could we anticipate greater near-term sales for both Apoquel and Cytopoint? And would this be true in both the U.S. and OUS? Second question, just on companion animal vaccines, when you talk about the vet visits and the greater revenue per visit, have you seen a ketchup in vaccines? And is this still working its way through the system? Or do you think we're already there? And just a clarification on the share repurchase, I just want to clarify that is in fact still on hold. Thank you.\nGlenn David: Yes, so \u2013 Kathy, I'll take the questions on dermatology on and on share repurchase. So in terms of the derm portfolio, if you look back to last year, we had over $750 million in sales and we grew 29%, right. Obviously, with a bigger base of revenue, we were expecting that growth rate to slow down. When you look at year-to-date, however, we've grown 25%, and that has exceeded our expectations and there's been a number of drivers in that. We've continued to invest behind the portfolio, it should drive growth and we've seen a very positive return on that. So we do expect to see better than expected performance in the derm portfolio than we would have when we started out the year, which is really pretty impressive considering the impact of COVID-19 as well. And it's a franchise that we will continue to make sure that we invest behind the growth in. In terms of share repurchase, we did mention on the last call that we were suspending our share repurchase for Q2, we are also suspending for Q3, and we'll continue to evaluate that throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nGregg Gilbert: Thanks. Kristin, I have a question. I'm sorry if this came up, I don't think it's a bit about insurance, both the company\u2019s involvement and then a broader industry question. So first question is what have you learned about pet insurance? And what went well? And what did not go so well in your launch in that space? And separate from Zoetis\u2019 involvement in that space, longer-term do you see broader based interest in pet owners buying insurance? It seems like everyone with pet sort of gripes about their out-of-pocket yet utilization of insurance is quite low. Do you think that's an employer mediate \u2013 employer mediated phenomenon that needs to be jump started or what are your thoughts on increasing penetration of insurance in the pet space over time? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure, thanks, Gregg. When we entered the space, it was really about assisting the pet owner and getting the care and increasing access to care and supporting the vet and providing the best care they can. And oftentimes, one of the challenges there is the sort of unexpected expense. So our focus really has been in this to get like a product that's more attractive to the consumer or to your point, the U.S. versus the rest of the world is underpenetrated in pet insurance. But we think the primary reason there is not because of employers or anything other than we think, you know, some of the products have not been as attractive to pet owners. So we really felt that the way we launched this, the focus on the pet owner would be attractive. We are pleased with our performance to date of our product with regards to Pumpkin, which is our pet insurance. And we look at that what's going to drive that and what feedback, we did get some feedback from veterinarians and they had concerns with regard to the inclusion of parasiticide. So we did change the \u2013 that program a little bit to look \u2013 focus more on diagnostics. And this is part of continuing to launch a new product and really iterate with our customers both with pet owners and vets to make it as attractive as we can. This is still a very, very small business relative to the rest of our business to be perfectly honest with you. It's not terribly material, but we are very pleased with how the company has been doing to date and most specifically in the number of new policies they continue to attract. And our goal is that we can make insurance grow the overall market, which is not hard to do since in the U.S., I think it\u2019s only 2% to 3% versus the other markets outside the U.S.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.\nPrakhar Agrawal: Hi, this is Prakhar Agrawal on behalf of Navin Jacob. My first question is on your antibodies. How do you see these products being differentiated versus some of your competitors, such as Elanco\u2019s Galliprant, and how are you thinking about the market opportunity here? And second question is did you increase in alternative channels have a material impact on your margins this quarter and a longer-term with continued increase in alternative channels, how should we think about the impact on your margin profile? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with the first question on the monoclonal antibodies and I'll let Glenn take the second question with regards to the alternative channels. Obviously, we don't have an approved product, so it's hard to say exactly how it would stack-up. But the focus on monoclonal antibodies is really a focus on a product with strong efficacy, with a strong safety profile. And these are large markets for example in the K9 space. We think that have gotten really comfortable with monoclonal antibodies as is evidenced by our performance on Cytopoint. It really also addresses a strong compliance issue, which is you remember to give the product to your dog every day. But it would say if you think about the feline or the cat monoclonal antibodies, there really aren't any products out there today in the cat space. So we think this is quite innovative in the cat monoclonal antibody space with really very little existing products that cat owners or vets can use. So we're quite excited, but until we have a profile it would be hard to say very specifically, but certainly from a compliance and safety perspective and efficacy, we think these will be very strong products that we think both vets and pet owners will be quite excited about. So, Glenn, do you want to take the second question?\nGlenn David:  Sure. So in terms of the impact of alternative channels on our margins, it did not have a material impact, and that's just based on the overall size of our sales in those channels, right. It really is limited to our U.S. companion animal business. So while the channel has expanded significantly in the quarter, it still represents less than 3% of our sales. So it's still not a big impact on the overall margin, but just to give a sense of the growth that we have seen. In 2019, in our U.S. companion animal business, the alternative channels represented about $100 million of sales for the year. In this quarter alone in Q2 that number was about $50 million. So that gives you a sense of the rapid increase we're seeing in these channels, but it's still small over an overall portion of our business to really impact our overall margins.\nOperator: And there does appear to be no further questions at this time. And I'll turn the call back over to your speakers for any additional remarks.\nKristin Peck: Okay, well, thanks everybody. I want to thank you for your questions and for your continued interest in Zoetis. While there's still many uncertainties around the impact and the resolution of COVID-19, the fundamental strength of our business and industry, we believe are proven and unchanged, and we remain very confident what Zoetis can achieve this year based on the diversity of our portfolio, the resiliency of our business, and certainly the spirit of our colleagues. So thanks for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect all of our professional and personal lives. On the call today, we will provide additional context around the impact of COVID-19 is having on our business, summarize the quarterly financial results, update you on our outlook and leave plenty of time to address your questions. In the second quarter, we delivered better than expected results given uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. And I want to thank all of our Zoetis colleagues, who have shown amazing resiliency, customer focus and perseverance throughout the year and our response to these challenging times. In terms of numbers, our revenue grew 4% operationally with the U.S. segment up 6% and international up 3%. Our companion animal products continue to drive our business performance with 13% operational growth, livestock products declined 5%. Our adjusted net income increased 4% operationally in the second quarter. We have built a very strong companion animal portfolio over the last several years based on our internal innovation. And these products have helped offset some of the deeper market challenges in the livestock market today. Our recently launched parasiticide compared to Trio, ProHeart 12 and Revolution Plus as well as our key dermatology portfolio of Apoquel and CytoPoint provides us solid foundation that has continued to form well this year. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new triple combination parasiticide for dogs Simparica Trio, as well as the strength of the overall Simparica franchise. Glenn will share more details in his remarks. Our continued focus on meaningful innovations and the diversity of our portfolio across PCs, products and geographies remain core advantages for Zoetis during times of economic uncertainty and we've also seen the essential nature of animal health playing an important role in the resiliency of our business and our industry at this time. In terms of COVID-19, our veterinary and producer customers are under increased pressure to deliver critical animal care and maintain a reliable global food supply and we are fortunate to be able to support them in this mission. We continue to put the safety of our colleagues and customers first during this pandemic. And we're very pleased with our team's ability to maintain productivity, even with safety and social distancing adjustments at our facilities, as well as the ongoing use of remote work arrangements for the majority of our colleagues. Our field force has returned to meeting with customers in many geographies based on local guidance and practices. We monitor and adapt these plans on a daily basis based on local feedback and adjustments in markets that may be experiencing increased COVID-19 cases. Our teams are excited to be back out with our customers, but we're also preserving the lessons we have learned from effective online interactions, webinars, and e-commerce to evolve our sales and support. In terms of supply chain, Zoetis has maintained a reliable inventory of critical medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to our customers and distributors in more than a hundred markets around the world. And our research development programs remain on track in terms of filings clinical trials and interactions with regulatory agencies. We remain confident in the progress of regulatory reviews of our monoclonal antibody candidates for pain in cats and dogs. Our submissions are proceeding as expected. This year continues to be uncharted territory due to COVID-19 and the related trends affecting our customers. However, the underlying demand for healthy pets and a reliable source of protein remains fundamental to the global economy. In the second quarter, we benefited from the veterinary clinics in the U.S. recovering much more quickly from the COVID-19 impact than we anticipated. Veterinary practices in the U.S. adapted quickly the Cribb site visits and mobile clinics to deliver critical care and maintain relationships with our customers. We also saw an acceleration of companion animal product sales through e-commerce channels as a result of the lockdowns in many States. Veterinarians and pet owners are adapting more quickly to these online options as a way to fill prescriptions for parasiticides and other medicines. We also know people are spending more time at home with their pets. They may be observing conditions such as itchiness or pain, which has previously gone unnoticed. And so, we're actually seeing an increase in spend per visit in U.S. clinics. Meanwhile, outside the U.S., companion animal veterinary clinic performance has been in line with expectations despite wide market by market variations based on local dynamics. For Zoetis, we expect our overall revenue growth for the remainder of the year to be driven largely by companion animal products, especially our parasiticide and key dermatology portfolio. We plan to continue investing in direct to consumer advertising and digital marketing to support these products. Livestock is a very different picture and remains very challenged by the pandemic, especially in the U.S. Producers are adjusting to new market demands and distribution needs from food service and restaurant channels to more grocery and retail channels while also managing ongoing labor, safety and trade issues. As expected, U.S. livestock in the second quarter saw a significant downturn as we expect that to remain a challenge for the rest of the year. The pace of return to more food service and restaurant demand along with increased export opportunities will be the most significant factors in the recovery of livestock producers in the U.S. Internationally, livestock grew and performed in line with expectations across a diverse set of markets. We saw very positive results in places like China, where they're further along in their COVID-19 recovery, but we will be sensitive to see how Latin America and markets like Brazil perform in the remainder of the year due to COVID. As you look ahead, we remain focused on advancing our five key priorities to ensure our long-term success: driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. We've continued to make important investments in products and innovations across the continuum of care from prediction and prevention to detection and treatment of disease. Supporting successful launches as well as new life cycle innovations and expansions of major products into new markets continue to be the cornerstones of our durable and steady performance. In the second quarter, we expanded major vaccine franchises with the approval of our Vanguard B Oral for dogs in Brazil and our Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCV Metastim for vaccines for pigs in Australia. We also continue to strengthen our diagnostic and digital capabilities building on recent acquisitions in point-of-care and reference labs along with additional investment. We plan to launch a new diagnostic platform for pet care in the third quarter called VETSCAN IMAGYST. We are very excited about the potential for this disruptive innovation, which will be the first systems to bring clinical pathology right to the point-of-care. This new multi-purpose platform uses a combination of image recognition technology, algorithms and cloud-based artificial intelligence to deliver rapid testing results to the clinic. Its first indication will be for testing fecal samples for parasites, making it quick and easy to test and treat pets in the same visit. We will have more to say in the coming weeks as we prepare for a global launch. We also view diagnostics is playing an important role in the continuum of care for fish. In the second quarter, we acquired Fish Vet Group to add more diagnostic tools to our aquaculture portfolio, including environmental testing, which is critical to fish farming. Finally, at Zoetis our key priority around high performing teams is tied to creating a culture where all colleagues feel valued and included and is reflected in our commitment to promoting inclusion, diversity and equity across our organization. Our leadership and board are dedicated to being a force for positive change across the globe to drive greater equity and inclusion. And we have dedicated financial and people resources to do so. As part of this plan, we have made commitments to publish our diversity statistics and to increase our representation of black colleagues and people of color overall in the U.S. As the world leader in animal health, we are committed to demonstrating our leadership on this important business and social issue. Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our second quarter results and updated guidance for the full year. Glenn? Okay. Hey Jon. With regards to your question on competitive response to Trio. It's been the response that we largely expected. Obviously, this is an innovative product. They were very aware it was coming. They're obviously running promotions. You probably saw some stock-ins as we probably saw as you move from Q1 to Q2, but we're really not seeing anything that we weren't expecting overall.  And to address your other question with regards to images, it's a completely separate product. It is actually a scanner and a microscope that then uploads to the cloud for analysis. So it is completely separate than VetScan. And it's a platform. And the first product, as we mentioned, will be around fecal, but it is not a replacement at all of the VetScan machine. It's a separate one that is both a scanner and a microscope. Sure. Thanks, Jon. A few things on that. I think the two big trends you're seeing in U.S. livestock \u2013 and I'd say you have to look at livestock. 50% of our livestock business is actually outside the U.S. and it grew at 4%. So again, this speaks to the diversity of our portfolio. But if you look at the sort of global trends you're talking about with regards to the movement from eating out to eating in, we do expect that to continue. And the guidance we've given for the rest of the year is that, that largely doesn't change too dramatically. It's obviously too early to tell in 2021 how that ultimately adjusts.  The second factor to consider in the livestock overall is the packing plants, which have been an issue in the U.S. Packing plant capacity in the U.S. still looks to be about 95% to 97%. And in some businesses, that may be good, but that does continue to back up animals. But again, this is mostly a U.S. trend, although we have seen a few isolated issues outside of the U.S. and Europe, Australia and some other markets.  But again, I think what producers are doing are doing their best to actually alter where they can the flow of animals. This is much easier for poultry to do, given they only have to make decisions on 45 days. Pigs can do it over six months. So I think you will see a slight reduction in the U.S. in pork. It is much harder for cattle producers. Most of those animals are already here. So we do see cattle probably continuing to struggle probably through the first half of next year.  But I think the third factor besides the dine in, dine out and packing plants to consider is actually the export market. What has really helped maintain a lot of the lot of the U.S. livestock flows has been the export market, with the largest player there clearly being China. And given ASF, they are still in need of a tremendous amount of pork. So those are the three factors that we're considering that gives us confidence that, to your question, in the short to medium term.  In general, livestock has grown around 5%. Obviously, it's been a little lower in the last few years. And I think, again, International was 4%. We were negative in the U.S. We do think in the medium term it goes back to normal levels, but we do think livestock will continue to be challenged certainly this year and likely at least to the first half of next year. Thanks, Jon. Sure. And to take the second half of your question, Mike, on images, we will be launching the U.S. and a few markets outside of the U.S. as we move into the end of Q3 to Q4. And there are consumables, but the consumable \u2013 the consumables, obviously, reagents there, but there's also a read. So obviously, with every test that's done, the read that's done in the cloud is also a fee. So there are both \u2013 some products to use to prepare the specimen. But there's also \u2013 more importantly, the read of each test in the cloud. So it's a consumable, I suppose, but it's almost like a different way of looking at it, which is a cost per read. I hope that answers it. Thanks, Mike. Sure. So Sure. So we'll start with your question with regard to African Swine Fever in China. What we've been seeing in China overall is that the larger, more sophisticated integrated producers are starting to rebuild their herd. As you saw, very strong growth in our China business of 24%. What you're seeing underlying this is the beginning of the rebuild of these herds. This is more isolated to sophisticated producers who can ensure biosecurity. Because to be clear, there's still African Swine Fever present in China. So I think what you're seeing is some of the smaller backyard producers are not rebuilding there, but we are seeing some of the more sophisticated ones doing so. And that is a positive trend for us because they would be more likely to use our products overall. But if you look at African Swine Fever, we are still predicting that China will have to continue to import pork a significant amount for the next few years.  So this rebuild is slow because, as I said, there is still African Swine Fever in China in a few isolated markets as well outside of China. So I suppose, if you look at that, for China, it will continue to be a tailwind for us, continuing to drive the China business as that herd rebuild.  And with regard to your second question on livestock and whether we're \u2013 some people are switching to lower-cost alternatives. Historically, that has been the case. So people will trade down. What's slightly different is that this is a pandemic with a recession. And I say that because, as long as there's more protein than people need, the price goes down. So hamburger meat right now is actually still pretty cheap.  So historically, we would've seen a recession. People trade down from beef to pork to chicken's egg. So we think that's still a longer-term trend. But with the disruption right now and the overcapacity, you are still seeing some other proteins still in certain markets on a relative basis not be that expensive. So I think it's \u2013 I would say your overall hypothesis over the medium to long term is true, although in certain markets, given overcapacity, the difference in price is not as dramatic as it normally is. Sure. Thanks, Louise. I think, similar to all businesses, we are \u2013 we've had to adjust the way we operate, and I've been incredibly impressed as the resilience of our colleagues and our customers and their creativity. So the first trend is we've obviously moved a lot more to doing virtual seminars or webinars to handling orders and things like that by phone. Our customers have adapted to more telemedicine in certain markets around the world. And if you look at more broadly in the U.S. and in certain markets outside the U.S. to e-commerce. So that is obviously for us, it's supporting our producers, our veterinarians and pet owners to make sure they can access our products wherever they our products wherever they need. But I think some of the skills that our field force is now learning will be one that will help us in the future, obviously reduces some of the travel that some of them had to do.  But our field force across the world, where businesses are allowing, are actually back seeing customers. Now it's not as many customers as they saw before in a day, and that has to be both a customer and a colleague feeling comfortable in a given market. But it also has to flex, obviously, given some of the flare-ups in the U.S. geographically and across the world, a lot more flexibility there. So I think it's both our customers getting creative and flexible and our field force and some of our capabilities overall as the company to be able to meet our customers where they are. So I think I'm quite impressed at how our colleagues and our customers have adopted. Sure. Sure, so I'll start David with your first question on the Durham portfolio. We were obviously quite pleased with its performance in the quarter, growing 24%. This is now obviously a blockbuster products as well as category. And to your point, we have expected competition for a while given the attractiveness of the sector. At this point in time, as you know \u2013 we have very intelligence, as you know, in our industry with regards to competitive launches, but based on what we know today, we are not expecting a competitive launch in the rest of 2020 and likely the first half of 2021. Obviously that's always subject to change since we don't know exactly what our competitors are doing, but we continue to believe that we will have competition in the space, but we, at this point, do not believe it's in the next 6 to 12 months. So our focus right now on our Durham portfolio is building those brands as big as we can. And if you saw in the quarter, our focus on direct-to-consumer advertising in the U.S. to continue to grow our share and to build the market itself. So your second question with regards to the platform, the images platform, what we're saying is it's the first fecal will be the first. Obviously, it could look at lots of others. I mean that's still \u2013 product that is still in our research and development to look at other types such as obviously blood and other types. But those are not things we are prepared at this point to discuss, but obviously the platform lends itself to be able to do multiple different tissue types. Thanks so much. Sure. Thanks, Balaji. For starters on the combination of Elanco and Bayer, as we said previously, we don't really see this as changing the competitive landscape in any dramatic way. We've competed against both of them many times before. Obviously, the acquisition of Bayer by Elanco will increase their business in the OTC space, where we honestly don't really operate. We do in the direct-to-consumer side, but not in the over-the-counter. So it's not a space that's important to us, especially with our focus on the veterinarian where that's more of a retail market there. So we don't foresee that changing it. They're both been well-capitalized competitors historically, so we don't see that as a major change. With regards to digital and data analytics, I think, it's an - and it is both a revenue driver as we announced today with IMAGYST certainly looking at products that drive revenues, such as platforms, such as vet. We've also spoken about precision livestock farming. So there's a numbers of ways in both companion animal and livestock that this continues to help us drive revenue in, but it's also an area where we can also be much more efficient, better targeting our customers, looking at new ways through e-commerce and other channels. We've done some quite exciting things. In China, for example, launching our own revolution page there and leveraging different tools in digital and data to just also make us more efficient, so to drive revenue and just increase our efficiency. So I think it is a \u2013 it's both. Thanks, Balaji. Thanks, Nathan. So as we look at Trio, we started shipping the distribution in late March and launched the product in April, right and probably the height of the pandemic at least in the U.S. What we've seen to date is that \u2013 that was more difficult for clinics to take on new products. That's often something that requires an in-person meeting and training of staff, et cetera. So we saw a slight \u2013 versus what we expected fewer penetration of clinics, but what we've been incredibly pleased about and why we've given the guidance of $100 million to 125 million, is that for the \u2013 we've been quite successful in corporate accounts ones that we engage quite early on this larger clinics and the ones we penetrated, our share in those clinics has grown faster than we expected. So I think that's been a positive. So I \u2013 again, we're continuing to grow our penetration of clinics, but we're quite pleased with the share. And what we're also pleased about is it's had less of an impact certainly in cannibalizing Simparica, which has been great. So we've certainly taken share from others, but our data also suggests we're also bringing new people back to the category of oral parasiticides, which we think is pretty exciting there. So, I think \u2013 whether this will be a typical season, if you look at some of the data with regards to vet visits Q2 year-over-year, they're still down, I think, about 3%, but it's a significant improvement from the negative 20 to negative 30 you saw it in the U.S. in the beginning of the quarter. But what's really interesting and what might affect your second \u2013 your question there is that the spend per visit, however, is up dramatically. So, latest data, we'll say it's maybe up about 7%. We do think that's going to moderate over time. This is probably people buying more of the products so they don't have to return to the vet in case there's something. So we do expect that to moderate some in the coming quarters, but that might mean that people may versus the normal \u2013 historical six months, six or so \u2013 six or seven months of buying the parasiticides, maybe they bought more. So we'll see that that goes, but we are expecting that to moderate. So I think, overall, we're looking for continued positive trends in companion animal, but I think it will be dependent on geography by geography. Sure, thanks, Gregg. When we entered the space, it was really about assisting the pet owner and getting the care and increasing access to care and supporting the vet and providing the best care they can. And oftentimes, one of the challenges there is the sort of unexpected expense. So our focus really has been in this to get like a product that's more attractive to the consumer or to your point, the U.S. versus the rest of the world is underpenetrated in pet insurance. But we think the primary reason there is not because of employers or anything other than we think, you know, some of the products have not been as attractive to pet owners. So we really felt that the way we launched this, the focus on the pet owner would be attractive. We are pleased with our performance to date of our product with regards to Pumpkin, which is our pet insurance. And we look at that what's going to drive that and what feedback, we did get some feedback from veterinarians and they had concerns with regard to the inclusion of parasiticide. So we did change the \u2013 that program a little bit to look \u2013 focus more on diagnostics. And this is part of continuing to launch a new product and really iterate with our customers both with pet owners and vets to make it as attractive as we can. This is still a very, very small business relative to the rest of our business to be perfectly honest with you. It's not terribly material, but we are very pleased with how the company has been doing to date and most specifically in the number of new policies they continue to attract. And our goal is that we can make insurance grow the overall market, which is not hard to do since in the U.S., I think it's only 2% to 3% versus the other markets outside the U.S. Sure. I'll start with the first question on the monoclonal antibodies and I'll let Glenn take the second question with regards to the alternative channels. Obviously, we don't have an approved product, so it's hard to say exactly how it would stack-up. But the focus on monoclonal antibodies is really a focus on a product with strong efficacy, with a strong safety profile. And these are large markets for example in the K9 space. We think that have gotten really comfortable with monoclonal antibodies as is evidenced by our performance on Cytopoint. It really also addresses a strong compliance issue, which is you remember to give the product to your dog every day. But it would say if you think about the feline or the cat monoclonal antibodies, there really aren't any products out there today in the cat space. So we think this is quite innovative in the cat monoclonal antibody space with really very little existing products that cat owners or vets can use. So we're quite excited, but until we have a profile it would be hard to say very specifically, but certainly from a compliance and safety perspective and efficacy, we think these will be very strong products that we think both vets and pet owners will be quite excited about. So, Glenn, do you want to take the second question? Okay, well, thanks everybody. I want to thank you for your questions and for your continued interest in Zoetis. While there's still many uncertainties around the impact and the resolution of COVID-19, the fundamental strength of our business and industry, we believe are proven and unchanged, and we remain very confident what Zoetis can achieve this year based on the diversity of our portfolio, the resiliency of our business, and certainly the spirit of our colleagues. So thanks for joining us today."

            "name": "Glenn David",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. I hope everyone is safe, healthy, and adapting to what is certainly an unprecedented time for all of us. Today, we'll provide additional commentary on our Q2 financial results, provide an update on our liquidity position and review our improved full year 2020 guidance. Beginning with the second quarter results, we generated revenue of $1.5 billion, which was flat on a reported basis and 4% growth operationally. Adjusted net income of $427 million, decreased 2% on a reported basis and increased 4% operationally. Foreign exchange in the quarter had an unfavorable impact of 4% on revenue. This was driven primarily by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and euro. Operational revenue growth at 4% was driven by 2% price and 2% volume. Volume growth. 2% includes 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 5% in other inline products.  Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 13% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally. Companion animal performance was driven by a parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., Canada and certain European markets and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint.  Revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance, and its nutritional products acquired in the second half of 2019, drove the growth in equine. Livestock declines in the quarter were driven by challenges to our U.S. livestock portfolio. Supply chain disruptions caused by reduced animal processing capacity and shifting consumer demand from restaurant and food service to grocery stores effected our customers' purchasing decisions. This decline was partially offset by strong performance internationally with growth in swine, fish and poultry. New products contributed 3% to overall growth in the quarter driven by Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12, Revolution Plus and our Alpha Flux parasiticides for salmon in Chile. We remain excited by the launch of Simparica Trio and are reaffirming the range of a $100 million to $125 million for full year incremental revenue. While vet clinic penetration is occurring at a more moderate pace as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, prescriptions in those clinics that have adopted Trio have been more robust and cannibalization of Simparica has been less than we anticipated.  Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $224 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally and contributing 3% overall revenue growth. Recent acquisitions contributed 1% growth this quarter, which includes Platinum Performance and our reference lab expansion strategy.  Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segments for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 6% with companion animal products growing 19% and livestock products declining by 18%. Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of Simparica franchise, our key dermatology products and the impact of recent acquisitions. U.S. key dermatology sales were $160 million for the quarter, growing 26%. The continued strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of both CytoPoint and Apoquel benefiting from our direct-to-consumer campaign, uptick in e-commerce channels and pet owners spending more time with their pets as a result of COVID-19. Simparica Trio performed well in the U.S. with sales of $36 million, despite challenging market conditions in Q2. We're observing several positive trends, included rapid uptake in clinic that have adopted Trio smaller than expected cannibalization of Simparica. Sales coming from new patients for the category and taking share from current oral flea and tick competitors. Diagnostic sales increased 18% in the quarter, largely driven by our reference lab acquisitions. In addition, previous instrument placements created a solid foundation for consumables growth in the second quarter. U.S. livestock declined 18% in the quarter driven by lower sales across all species. In the second quarter, we faced challenges with significant declines in feedlot placements, reduced demand from the food service industry and the effects that had throughout the food supply chain and our customers, in addition to increased competition. To summarize, U.S. performance was strong in a difficult market environment. And the diversity of our portfolio, again, proved beneficial as growth in companion animal offset the challenges faced in the U.S. by our livestock portfolio.  Our international segment had operational revenue growth of 3% in the second quarter with more balanced performance across our companion animal and livestock portfolios. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 2% and livestock operational growth was 4%. Increase sales in companion animal products with a result of growth in our key dermatology portfolio and our Simparica franchise, including the launch of Simparica Trio in Canada.  While European markets were impacted significantly by COVID-19, the decline was offset by significant growth in other markets, including Japan and China. Diagnostics had a difficult quarter as wide-scale clinic closures resulting from COVID-19, limited the ability to place the instruments and negatively impacted consumable usage.  International livestock growth in the quarter was driven by swine, fish and poultry. Swine grew double digits in the quarter, primarily driven by China, which grew 25% as key accounts continue to expand their herds and production shifts from smaller farms to larger scale operations.  Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter. We saw favorable conditions in Chile and Norway that resulted in vaccinations being accelerated into Q2. In addition, we continue to see an uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile. Overall, our international segment was again, a positive contributor to revenue growth with performance in swine, companion animal, fish, and poultry, more than offsetting declining cattle resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 71.1%, increased slightly on a reported basis compared to the prior year due to price, favorable manufacturing costs and product mix, which were partially offset by foreign exchange, recent acquisitions and higher inventory charges. Adjusted operating expenses were flat operationally. The incremental advertising and promotion expense is related to Simparica Trio, recent acquisitions and R&D increases were largely offset by reductions to T&E and compensated related costs as a result of COVID-19.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%. The increase versus prior year is driven by the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recorded in Q2 2019. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 4% operationally, primarily driven by revenue growth and adjusted diluted EPS grew 6% operationally.  Next, I'd like to cover our liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the second quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including the proceeds from our $1.25 billion long-term debt issuance in May, of which $500 million is earmarked for repayment of our November 2020 maturity. We have access to a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a coinciding commercial paper program, both of which remain undrawn. Given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities for internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Consistent with what I mentioned last quarter, we still anticipate elevated capital expenditures this year to support investments in manufacturing, information technology to support our recent acquisitions and capabilities in digital and data analytics.  With regard to returning excess cash to shareholders, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend, which represents a 22% increase over 2019. In Q1, we repurchased $250 million in Zoetis shares before suspending the program in the second quarter in order to conserve cash. We have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our multi-year share repurchase program.  Now moving on to our updated guidance assumptions for 2020. Our cash performance has always given us confidence that the essential nature of our business, a diverse portfolio and the innovation we consistently bring to our customers would position us well during difficult market conditions. After assessing recent trends and our performance in the second quarter, we're further refining and raising our full year 2020 guidance. We expect recent positive companion animal trends in the U.S. will continue. Although vet clinic revenue may moderate somewhat as pent-up demand works its way through the system. Alternatively, we believe social distancing measures are negatively impacting the food service recovery and will continue to present challenges to our livestock business in the U.S. The more recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases in parts of the U.S. and expanding rates of infection in international markets continues to create uncertainty around the duration, scope and economic impact of the pandemic.  Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July and given our global footprint, movement in foreign exchange has had an impact on revenue and adjusted net income since we issued our prior guidance in May.  Our current guidance includes favorable foreign exchange at revenue of approximately $50 million and approximately $10 million at adjusted net income versus May guidance.  For revenue, we're raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $6.3 billion and $6.475 billion and operational revenue growth of between 3% and 6% for the full year versus the negative 2% to positive 3% we had in our May guidance.  Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of between $1.685 billion and $1.765 billion, representing operational growth, a positive 1% to positive 5% compared to our prior guidance of negative 9% to negative 3%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.68 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.14 to $3.32. In closing, while the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly presented a set of challenges we have not seen in the past. We're extremely proud of our colleagues and the commitment they have shown toward our customers, our company, and animal healthcare.  During this time, we have demonstrated the diversity and durability of our portfolio, the resiliency of our industry, and we have confidence in our ability to continue to execute on our strategy during these uncertain times. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? So Jon, I'll address the first part of your question with operating margins and mix. So as you say, we have very favorable gross margin in this quarter as well as the first half of the year. As we look into the second half of the year, we do expect there to be some deterioration in gross margin. And that does come from product mix, right? The separation that we've seen in performance in the quarter, livestock declined 5% operationally. Companion animal growth grew 13%. We expect that to narrow in the second half of the year, the differential in performance between companion animal and livestock. So that will negatively impact mix.  The other component is that we generally have a larger portion of livestock sales in the second half of the year than we do have in the first half of the year. The other component to consider is OpEx. As we move into the second half of the year and our field returns more and more to visiting clinics, T&E expenses, which has been very favorable, particularly in Q2, will rise as we go into Q3 and Q4. In terms of the dynamics between Q3 and Q4, don't really see any big differential in terms of the dynamics between Q3 and Q4. So Mike, just in terms of your first question in terms of the guidance in revenue of the 34% to 6% growth. So to your point, in the first half, we grew 5% with a limited impact from COVID-19 in Q1. That would imply a second half of 2% to 7% growth essentially. I think, a, it's first important to understand that, in the first half, that 5% growth did have a contribution from acquisitions of about 1%, which we won't have that same contribution in the second half of the year because of when the timing of those acquisitions occurred last year. So that really brings you to organic growth of about 4% in the first half of the year, which is the real comparator for that implied 2% to 7% growth in the second half of the year.  So really pretty balanced between first half and second half organically with the first quarter not really having a significant impact from COVID-19. To your question about what brings you to the low end of the range, that would be a more would be a more severe impact of COVID-19 than we're seeing today across our markets. What takes you to the higher end of that range is things sort of stabilizing as they are for the rest of the year without a more rapid or more significant impact of COVID-19. Yes, so \u2013 Kathy, I'll take the questions on dermatology on and on share repurchase. So in terms of the derm portfolio, if you look back to last year, we had over $750 million in sales and we grew 29%, right. Obviously, with a bigger base of revenue, we were expecting that growth rate to slow down. When you look at year-to-date, however, we've grown 25%, and that has exceeded our expectations and there's been a number of drivers in that. We've continued to invest behind the portfolio, it should drive growth and we've seen a very positive return on that. So we do expect to see better than expected performance in the derm portfolio than we would have when we started out the year, which is really pretty impressive considering the impact of COVID-19 as well. And it's a franchise that we will continue to make sure that we invest behind the growth in. In terms of share repurchase, we did mention on the last call that we were suspending our share repurchase for Q2, we are also suspending for Q3, and we'll continue to evaluate that throughout the year. Sure. So in terms of the impact of alternative channels on our margins, it did not have a material impact, and that's just based on the overall size of our sales in those channels, right. It really is limited to our U.S. companion animal business. So while the channel has expanded significantly in the quarter, it still represents less than 3% of our sales. So it's still not a big impact on the overall margin, but just to give a sense of the growth that we have seen. In 2019, in our U.S. companion animal business, the alternative channels represented about $100 million of sales for the year. In this quarter alone in Q2 that number was about $50 million. So that gives you a sense of the rapid increase we're seeing in these channels, but it's still small over an overall portion of our business to really impact our overall margins."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all doing well. Welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2020 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 6, 2020. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. I think it's fair to say the past few months have been unlike any we've ever experienced in business or that any of us could have imagined for our families, friends and communities. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had such an incredible impact on our world and for many of us personally. It has given me a chance to reflect, not just on the financial numbers we reported today, but on the true value our business provides society, the role we play in public health, the support we deliver for our customers in crisis and the safety and security we provide to our colleagues. For Zoetis, we're privileged to play an essential role in sustaining and protecting animal and human life during the outbreak. Our products and services play a critical part in animal health, helping support pet care and the food supply, and we've continued to manufacture products and serve customers even in places that have imposed stringent limits on businesses in the wake of the coronavirus. Our colleagues are more committed than ever to supporting the nutrition and comfort that animals provide the world and that purpose has motivated us to continue serving our customers and communities in these extraordinary times. I'm especially proud of the efforts of Zoetis colleagues in supporting our local communities, healthcare workers and businesses during the outbreak. We've been contributing surplus personal protective equipment from our operations. We've been increasing production of human health diagnostics and answering requests from local hospitals for a variety of assistance. As far as the direct impact of COVID-19 on our colleagues, we've been fortunate to see only a small number of COVID-19 cases in our workforce of more than 10,000 colleagues. Thanks to increased safety measures, hygiene protocols and adjustments to our operations. About 70% of our colleagues today are working remotely. They are being productive as they adjust to new arrangements, juggle new home and family responsibilities and benefit from the use of technology infrastructure that we've invested in and continue to enhance at this time. The other 30% of our colleagues are working at our sites supporting essential operations such as manufacturing, distribution and logistics, clinical trials and research and technical services and support for customers. Our teams in Zoetis sites are adhering to strict health and hygiene protocols recommended by the WHO and CDC. They're practicing social distancing, operating in staggered shifts and participating in health monitoring, all as part of the adjustments we've made at each plant to limit potential exposure. Our 30 manufacturing sites remain open around the globe today and we've been able to maintain supply of critical product inventories. We've also shown excellent agility to deal with the local market changes in terms of border controls, regulatory changes and freight operations. I'm also pleased to say that even under these difficult circumstances, we were able to meet our launch timing for Simparica Trio, our highly anticipated triple combination parasiticide. We launched Simparica Trio in the UK, Spain, and Italy in February. Made initial shipments for distribution in the U.S. in March and initiated the full launch in the U.S. and Canada in April, with more markets to follow. We've seen significant interest in Trio and we've been supporting its introduction with consumer ads in the U.S. this spring. While we're excited by the introduction and the receptiveness of customers and pet owners, we've had to revisit full year projections for Simparica Trio, given the expected impact of COVID-19 and the recession. Glenn will speak more to this in his remarks. We are grateful, we've been able to keep our major R&D programs on track. We continue to advance our research in key areas such as monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in cats and dogs and vector vaccines for poultry. We're continuing with regulatory reviews, commissions are going in and we're maintaining momentum at our most critical projects for the future, all while keeping colleagues safe. From a P&L perspective, in the first quarter, the pandemic had a limited impact on our results given the February quarter-end for international markets and the timing of shelter in place across the U.S. We generated 7% operational growth in revenue and 10% operational growth in adjusted net income, thanks to the strength of our diverse portfolio and global scope of our business. We expect a more significant revenue impact from COVID-19 in Q2 and for the year as the lockdowns and recession have a continued impact on our business, especially in terms of traffic at companion animal clinics and reduction in demand for protein from their restaurant and dine out sectors. We will need to watch carefully how the reopening of various markets in the coming weeks impact veterinary services for companion animals as well as livestock. Glenn will discuss 2020 guidance in more detail in a few minutes, but I'm pleased to share that Zoetis remains a resilient company at times like these, given the essential nature of our business and our diverse portfolio. In most markets, our sales teams are working virtually to respect local government guidance and limit potential exposure of COVID-19 for colleagues and customers. We've been keeping in regular contact with our customers through phone calls, video conferences, webinars and surveys. And we're responding as best we can to anticipate and address their most important needs. We're here to help them maintain critical care and supply for their customers at this time and adapt to a new normal for the future of animal care. For example, we've been advising customers on increasing digital content for their use of pet owners, offering telemedicine solutions through new partnerships, discussing their liquidity concerns, offering continuing education for veterinary staff and providing technical support services to deal with adjustments being made to food production. We are seeing many of the trends you are in terms of animal health and food supply as well as decreased traffic to veterinary practices, but history tells us that animal health medicines, vaccines and other products remain essential even in a challenging economy. On the livestock side of the business, the need for food hasn't gone away, but with restaurants and hotels closed, consumer demand has shifted to supermarkets. There's less demand for beef and dairy products while poultry remains strong as people choose less expensive proteins. As with every front-line business today, the biggest challenge our livestock customers are having is maintaining their operations with enough healthy workers to handle processing, packing, and delivering food. On the pet side of the business, veterinary traffic is down in places where containment measures are in place. Now, many vets are leveraging curbside check-ins, home visits, telemedicine and online pharmacy distribution to take the place of in-clinic visits. As you look ahead, our business continuity plans are working well and we continue to show great agility and responsiveness to this crisis. We are carefully managing our expenses and doing scenario planning for the medium and long-term, including hiring freezes and rejections to discretionary spending such as travel, entertainment and consulting. We have not had to engage in furloughs or salary reductions for our colleagues. Thanks to the resiliency and diversification of our business and our strong balance sheet. We continue to regularly assess any long-term needs depending on the duration of the pandemic and the resulting recession. Like all companies, we begun planning for the days when more of our colleagues will return to the workplace. Over the last few months, we have safely maintained operations in our manufacturing distribution and R&D facilities to ensure continuous supply to our customers while maintaining strict quality standards and keeping our colleagues safe. We plan to leverage these enhanced policies and procedures for a phased return to work that helps ensure the safety of not just our colleagues, but the customers they interact within the field. I am proud of our teams for their resourcefulness, flexibility and commitment to colleagues and customers. Their efforts are helping us to envision an even better way to work over the long-term. When we began this year, my first as CEO, I laid out five priorities for Zoetis and those are as relevant today as they were then. Our priorities remain driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. As we managed through the crisis to this new normal, we will find relevant new ways to adapt our strategies and tactics for the future. Even in the midst of COVID-19, we continue to act on opportunities to advance these priorities. Since February, we received approval of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and Australia and have launched it in several markets with the support of direct-to-consumer advertising and digital marketing where applicable. We acquired Performance Livestock Analytics, a company which brings us proven cloud-based management systems and data analytics for beef producers. And we announced Pumpkin, a new pet health startup is offering pet insurance and preventative care in the U.S. Once again, I'm very proud of the results we've been able to deliver this quarter and I look forward to your questions. Now, let me hand over to Glenn for more detail on the first quarter results and our updated view for the rest of 2020. Glenn?\nGlenn David: Thank you, Kristin and good morning. Echoing Kristin\u2019s comments, we find ourselves in a world we never imagined. I\u2019m grateful for our colleagues as they balance new working arrangements, caring for their families, and keeping our essential business running during this crisis. Today I'll provide commentary on our Q1 results, provide clarity on our liquidity position and review our updated guidance for 2020. Historically, we know that Zoetis has remained a resilient company, given the essential nature of our business and our diverse portfolio. But no one yet knows the full extent, duration or implications that this pandemic will have. Our updated guidance reflects our best estimates based on what we know today. Beginning with the first quarter results, we generated revenue of $1.5 billion, representing an increase of 5% on a reported basis and 7% operationally. Adjusted net income of $455 million, increased 7% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Foreign exchange in the quarter drove an unfavorable 2% impact on revenue, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Operational revenue growth of 7% was driven by 3% price and 4% volume. Volume growth of 4% includes 2% from key dermatology products, 2% from new products, 1% from acquisitions, and a decline of 1% in other inline products. The first quarter was not materially impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19, given the February quarter end for our international markets and the timing of quarantine guidelines in the U.S. However, as indicated in our updated guidance ranges, we anticipate a more significant impact for the full year as the lockdowns and recessions have a continued impact on our business. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 10% operationally while livestock grew 3% operationally. Companion animal performance was driven by continued strength of our key dermatology products and parasiticide portfolio, which includes initial sales of Simparica Trio in both the U.S. and certain European markets. Revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance, which was acquired in the second half of 2019 and its nutritional products also contributed to strong equine growth. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong poultry, swine and fish performance partially offset by declines in cattle. New products contributed 2% to overall growth in the quarter, driven by some Simparica Trio and ProHeart 12 and our Alpha Flux parasiticide for fish in Chile. We remain very excited and confident in our ability to successfully launch Simparica Trio beginning with key markets in Europe and the U.S. However, we are now anticipating the incremental revenue for the full year to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million. The initial response from veterinarians has been extremely encouraging. However, due to the current COVID-19 situation, clinic penetration and adoption will be more gradual than initially expected. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $194 million in the quarter, growing 25% operationally and contributing 2% to overall revenue growth. The ongoing strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of APOQUEL, resulting from promotional investments, increased adoption of CYTOPOINT, as well as entry into new markets and price. Recent acquisitions and commercial agreements contributed 1% growth this quarter, which includes Platinum Performance, our reference lab acquisitions and the stable lab diagnostic test for equine. Other in-line products declined this quarter, primarily driven by declines in U.S. cattle related to ongoing beef and dairy market challenges. Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 9% with companion animal products growing 12% and livestock products growing 5%. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by increased sales of our key dermatology products, growth of the Simparica franchise and the impact of recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by declines in point-of-care diagnostics. U.S. key dermatology sales were $136 million for the quarter, growing, 31%. Growth this quarter was driven by ongoing promotional investments and expanded usage of CYTOPOINT in the clinic. Simparica Trio revenue in the quarter included initial sales, the distribution channels with product becoming available to veterinarians for prescribing in mid-April. We're supporting the launch with strong field force engagement and direct-to-consumer advertising. We remain confident in the long-term success of this product, despite launching within the current environment. Diagnostic sales in the quarter were primarily impacted by distributor purchasing patterns and slower demands in March related to COVID-19. U.S. livestock returned to growth this quarter, supported by positive performance in poultry and swine, partially offset by cattle declines. Poultry continues to benefit from our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives, driven by new customer adoption and efficacy challenges for a competitive product. Swine also had a strong quarter, driven by increased sales of any effectives and the one-time replenishment of a classical swine fever vaccine stockpile by the USDA. Cattle product sales continued to be negatively impacted by unfavorable beef market conditions driven by feedlot placements of heavier and healthier animals with a lower risk profile and dairy continue to face headwinds from negative producer profitability and oversupply. To summarize, U.S. performance was strong, despite ongoing challenges in U.S. and dairy cattle markets. Our International segment had operational revenue growth of 4% in the quarter. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 8% and livestock operational growth was 2%. Companion animal product growth resulted from increased sales of our Simparica franchise, including the launch of Simparica Trio in certain EU markets and growth in our key dermatology portfolio. New diagnostic customer accounts and strong performance in China also contributed to growth in the quarter, despite the impact of social distancing measures in China. International livestock growth in the quarter was driven primarily by swine, fish and poultry. Swine returned to growth in the quarter, due to expanding herd production and key account penetration across emerging markets including China. Our short-term outlook for China remains neutral to slightly positive as they rebuild due to lower incidents of African Swine Fever. However, certain smaller markets in Asia continue to experiences challenges related to ASF. The fish portfolio benefited from the continued uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile, while poultry growth was driven primarily by price. Overall, our International segment continued to be a positive contributor to revenue growth with all species flat to growing, including swine returning to growth even in the current challenging environment. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.3% increased slightly on a reported basis compared to the prior year, due to price partially offset by the mildly deluded impact of recent acquisitions. Total adjusted operating expenses grew 7% operationally. The increase was primarily related to the impact of recent acquisitions, investments to support future growth of the business and direct-to-consumer advertising. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.8%, the decrease from the comparable 2019 period is primarily driven by the tax benefits from share-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 10% operationally driven by revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally. Next I'd like to cover our liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as well as access to $1 billion revolving credit facility and a coinciding commercial paper program, both of which are undrawn. Given a strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Consistent with what I mentioned last quarter, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures this year to support investments in manufacturing, information technology to support our recent acquisitions and capabilities in digital and data analytics. However, we are delaying expenditures that will not materially impact our medium and long-term growth strategy. Our strong liquidity also allows us to be opportunistic and continue executing on our M&A strategy. In consistent with what I've said before, our focus is on strategic acquisitions, not large scale transformational M&A. Our recent acquisitions of Performance Livestock Analytics is a good example. With regards to returning excess cash to shareholders, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend, which represents a 22% increase over 2019. In Q1, we also repurchased $250 million in Zoetis shares and we have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our multi-year share repurchase program. However, in light of the current situation, we have decided to temporarily suspend our share repurchases and conserve cash. Now moving on to our updated guidance assumptions for 2020. As I noted earlier, we cannot know the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation continues to evolve daily. Our updated guidance reflects our current assumptions and may change materially as the situation progresses. Our guidance assumes that the economy begins to open up in the second half of the year with pet care visits returning to more normalized levels as the year progresses and our livestock customers being able to maintain their operations. It also assumes a continued recession this year. We have increased the width of our ranges, as the timing of returning to normal operations and the depth of the recession is still uncertain. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April and movement in foreign exchange rate has had a significant impact on our revenue and adjusted net income, since prior guidance, given our global footprint. Our current guidance includes unstable foreign exchange revenue of approximately $150 million and approximately $50 million at adjusted net income, primarily driven by the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and the euro. We are now projecting revenue between $5.95 billion and $6.25 billion, representing a 2% operational decline to 3% operational growth. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is now expected to be in the range of 30.5% to 31.5%, increasing slightly from February guidance due to increased manufacturing and freight costs related to COVID-19. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are now expected to be between $1.455 billion and $1.545 billion with the decrease from the February guidance, driven by savings and compensation due to hiring freezes and reductions to discretionary spending, such as travel and entertainment and professional service spent. As Kristin indicated, our key R&D programs are progressing and so adjusted R&D expenses are now expected to be between $440 million and $465 million, consistent with our commitment to invest in pipeline opportunities. We're also continuing to invest in strategic areas of focus such as diagnostics, biodevices, and precision livestock farming and strategies to maximize the value of the continuum of care through integrated offerings. While we were taking measures to reduce expenses this year, we also remain committed to bring medium and long-term growth and value to our shareholders. Adjusted interest and other income deductions is now expected to be approximately $215 million with the increase over February guidance driven by lower interest income and other factors. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%, consistent with February guidance. Adjusted net income is expected to be in a range of $1.52 billion to $1.64 billion representing an operational decline of 2% to 9%. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.42 and reported diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.07. While our guidance represents full year expectations, we do anticipate revenue and adjusted net income to be most significantly impacted in Q2, based upon quarantine and shelter in place guidelines that have been put in place in most major markets around the world and the economic impact of recession. We anticipate the second half of the year will be impacted, but to a lesser extent. Now to summarize, before we move to Q&A. Pre COVID-19, 2020 was off to a strong start and inline with our expectations, with 7% operational revenue growth and 10% operational growth and adjusted net income. The essential nature of our business, the diversity of our portfolio and the durability of our business will allow us to continue executing on our strategy during this period of uncertainty. We're confident, we'll be able to maintain strong liquidity and manage effectively through this challenging environment, given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, and despite managing our spend in the short-term as we navigate through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to medium and long-term profitable growth through responsible investment. Now, I have things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks for taking the questions. I'll ask sort of a big picture one to get the ball wrong. Steve, Glenn, Kristin, you\u2019ve all alluded to various expense on the economic impacts of the recession, both about the press release and in your prepared remarks. Could you just help us walk through the nuance of there and how you think about that affecting both the livestock markets and the companion animal market? Because as we think through it, all the other impacts through the livestock, slaughterhouse closures, the food service shift, the vet visits, that's still for the most part transient expected to bounce back later this year. But the recessionary impact on the guide, that's something that could very well persistent 2021 and 2022. So how do you think about that affecting the business, if you could offer any pointers related to 2008, 2009 that'd be really helpful as we walk through it. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll talk a little bit about some of the broader trends and then I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about what that means overall and guidance and how that translates. If we start at the vet clinic side and the pet care side. Q1, there really was limited impact just given the timing of the quarantine decisions across the world, and China tended to rebound a little bit. As we moved into early April, we did see significant impacts about \u2013 to about 20% to 30% reduction in the U.S., and in Europe, 30% to 50%. The very good news right now is that those are turning around quite quickly. We're seeing a significant improvement both in the U.S. and Europe in overall clinic visits. And so our expectation is obviously, overall a week Q2, but that will improve in Q3 and Q4, also because we strongly believe that that's our \u2013 being very thoughtful about how they increase their business, leveraging telemedicine, curbside, drop off, lots of different strategies there. As you look at the livestock sector, I mean, there are two big trends impacting this. The first is the shift out of dine-out and into grocery stores. Historically that was about a 50-50 split. And now about 80% to 90% of consumption is coming out of grocery stores. Historically those supply chains were quite different. So the channel migration there has been a little challenging as you've seen. And the second trend there has been an exacerbated in the U.S. specifically around the reduction and the battery, and at this point about a 15% reduction of processing capacity, given some of the outbreaks at some of those sites, which continues to be obviously in the news every day. Again, the good news is that's a U.S. trend and that trend is not relevant internationally. But what we do see sort of in the medium term as we look into Q2, Q3, Q4, as this will put a pressure on our customers, on livestock producers, it is decreasing price and therefore their profitability. It's likely going to decrease their herd size and also put pressure on their import costs and potentially have them trade down. The question is, how fast that works through? It\u2019s quick to work through that in poultry, a little more challenging in swine and in catalyst we\u2019ve seen \u2013 that really is just exacerbating as Glenn mentioned in his remarks, a trend we've been seeing for awhile. We strongly believe the long-term fundamentals remain strong in all these sectors. So the animal protein consumption will continue to grow. So I think a lot of this is a more of an impact as we work through some of these dynamics this year and the humanization of pets has never been more important than it is now, as you\u2019ve seeing on adoptions of animals, and in previous recessions it\u2019s pretty resilient. But I'll let Glenn sort of talk through how he thinks about those trends as we did our guidance.\nGlenn David: Absolutely. Mike, to your question on the economic impacts of the recession, as we saw back in 2008, 2009, the animal health industry was essentially flat, showing strong resiliency. And then it had a pretty rapid bounce back in the next year growing around 7%. So in terms of the recessionary impacts, as Kristin said, the companion animal business, just due to a recession, we expect to be very resilient. We saw that back in 2008 and 2009, and the trends of pets becoming more part of the family has only continued even stronger there. In terms of the livestock area of the business, though, that's where the recession may have a larger impact. A, as people trade down to lower cost proteins, but also our livestock producers tend to go to cheaper products as their profitability is challenged, and we do provide premium products. So there will be some pricing challenges and just some overall challenges in the livestock industry more so than companion animal from a recession.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions here on the companion animal side. How much did Simparica Trio stocking contribute in the quarter? And how should we be thinking about that quarterly cadence in light of some of the COVID dynamics for Simparica Trio? Is the $150 million target for Simparica Trio still intact? And can you speak to also some of the traction you're seeing across the alternative online channel in the companion animal segment just amidst COVID and some of the dynamics there? How big is that segment for you now? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Erin. I'll start off and let Glenn build on it. We've been very excited at the very strong awareness and anticipation for the launch of the really innovative Simparica Trio. We did see stocking, as I think we mentioned in Q1, of around $15 million. That was really just the distribution. We did the full launch to vets and to customers in April, and we followed that shortly thereafter with a very strong direct-to-consumer advertising push, which has been very well received. We remain very excited about this product. However, we are cognizant that with the pandemic, social distancing as well as the recession, the outlook for 2020 will be adjusted. I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about that guidance. But outside the U.S., we launched in February in the U.K., Italy and Spain. We also recently launched in Canada. So we've remain very excited about the potential for this product, and we think we'll have a very good 2020, and we're pleased given \u2013 at the launch so far, and given what we're facing with the pandemic. But I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about the updated guidance.\nGlenn David: Yes. In term of the updated guidance for Simparica Trio, we've now brought our estimate down from $150 million in incremental sales to $100 million to $125 million, and that's really based on launching in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of how we see the quarterly progression, we're not necessarily going to give quarterly forecast, but we did about $15 million in the quarter, and we do expect that to grow gradually over the year and to reflect more underlying demand throughout the year. To your question on the alternative channels, Erin, we are definitely seeing a ramp-up in alternative channels as a way for our customers to get their prescriptions filled. However, it's important to remember that, that is off of a relatively lower base still today. And also about 50% of our products do need to be administered within the clinic. So while we are seeing a rapid increase, it is off of a relatively small base.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So we're seeing a lot of headlines around protein supply chain. Are these headlines mostly noise? Or do they concern you in any way? And could you give more color on your producer supply chain assumptions in your guidance? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Louise. Unfortunately, I do not think they are noise, but they're indeed , very real to our customers. It is taking a large part of our field force and technical services supporting our customers through this. Shedding some of these packing plants and having 15% of the capacity of the U.S. packing taken offline, backs up significantly to our producers. They have nowhere to put animals. We are an economy in the livestock space that was just in time, and they were \u2013 trying to make sure they were as efficient as possible. So it is a quite serious issue for our producers, and it does have impact that will be important in 2020. It is decreasing the price that they're willing to pay. They don't need the animals. So they're paying less for them. That significantly hurts the profitability of our customers and certainly would courage them at this point to reduce herd sizes. So it does have an impact. As I was trying to express before, some of that impact, as you look at it, it can be turned around quite quickly in poultry, where 43 days, you can make some new decisions there to expand production. There's a little more time in pork. The effects took a lot longer to work through in the beef side. So we do think they will have an impact in 2020 significantly on the livestock side that was baked into the guidance we provided. But I'll let Glenn talk a little bit more to that.\nGlenn David: Yes, to Kristin's point, we did bake this into the guidance. Now when you look at our guidance, we do expect that Q2 will be more severely impacted. So the challenges that we're seeing now in livestock with the plant closures are baked in, and we do expect that Q2 will be more severely impacted for livestock and also for companion animal as well as this is when we see the clinic visit probably at their lowest in Q2. When we look toward the full year guidance range, the higher end of our ranges do assume that our producer customers are able to return to more normal operations throughout the second half of the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJon Kaufman: Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. Thank you for taking the question. So one on the Pumpkin insurance launch. Can you talk about your pricing strategy here? How do your prices and coverage compare to others in the market? And on the preventive aspect of this, the direct-to-pet owner shipping. Is there a chance that you risk anchoring veterinarians because you're taking parasiticide sales out of the clinic? Or will there be some sort of reimbursement of that's related to these scripts? And then just another quick one here. I don't think I heard the dermatology sales breakout between U.S. and international. Can you provide those? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I\u2019ll start on Pumpkin, and then Glenn can follow-up on the derm question, John. We're very excited about the launch of Pumpkin. I think it's actually never been more relevant than it is as we enter a recession. The focus of the Pumpkin insurance and preventative plans is really increasing access to care. It's one of the biggest issues that pet owners have and their vet struggle with is, what's the price? Can they get a pet and can they afford care? And really the new value proposition that we were trying to offer vets and pet owners is a real focus on preventative. So our plan is unique and it really helps cover it completely two to three core vaccines for dogs and for cats, parasiticides for the year and that wellness visit, which is an important part. Many pet owners didn't want to get pet insurance in the U.S. because they felt like it only paid \"if their animal got sick\". And under the new wave that we have combined the insurance and the preventative care plan, we think pet owners will see the value at day one. And so although there are some changes to where that goes for a vet clinic, ensuring that those animals will be coming in regularly because that is a visit that's paid for, for the vaccines and the wellness visits and the parasiticides, we think, really does help the veterinarian. So as we sat down, I think there was a lot of \u2013 I think, from some of our competitors, noise around that when it first launched. But as we sat down to explain the vet, what we're paying for overall in a wellness visit, how we'll be encouraging that, how we'll be covering vaccines. I think veterinarians are quite excited at the opportunity as many new people have adopted pets. And the opportunity in the space overall, in the U.S., with penetration levels of pet insurance very low at 2%, 3% versus the rest of the world at 20%, 30%, 40%, is significant And we think, especially going into recession, this is an important part of ensuring that pets get the care and that they go to the vet to get that care. So I'll turn it over to Glenn to comment on the derm.\nGlenn David: Yes. So in terms of the total derm sales breakout. So for the year, total was \u2013 for the quarter, total was $194 million with 25% growth, U.S. was $136 million with 31% growth and international was $28 million with 14% growth.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll ask both upfront. Kristin, maybe the first one for you. I may have missed it, but I don't think I heard a revised market growth figure versus the previous 4% to 5%, is there one there? And then if so, is your 0.5% operational midpoint, call it, still above market expectations? And then the second one, Glenn, just the flowdown in EPS was a little bit more \u2013 was little bit bigger than what we were expecting. So any color on the decremental margins as we think on how it impacted the P&L? I'm guessing maybe part of that is FX, but any color you can provide would be helpful. Thanks guys.\nKristin Peck: Sure, John. Great question. No, you did not miss the what is the new market projection to be. The groups that project the market growth, obviously, has not been able to do that yet, and this is a fast emerging. So there is no general sense. As we look at it, we continue to see that pet care will probably have the strongest growth globally overall, followed by poultry. As we look at the swine growth overall, although that we're seeing significant impacts in the U.S. right now, given ASF in China and really the strong demand that China is going to continue to have to import swine, we think swine will likely be okay. It will probably have some impact but will do better. And we see the greatest impact overall in cattle. As you look at our business, we're about 50% companion animal, 50% livestock. So it really \u2013 we haven't seen updated market growth numbers to how we compare to that. But we think we will be doing better than the market. And I think it might be helpful. Glenn can talk a little bit about you use the midpoint of the range, but we'll talk a little bit what the assumptions are for us at the high end of the range and what the assumptions are at the lower end of the range to help you better navigate that. So I'll let Glenn take that question as well as the EPS.\nGlenn David: Yes. So John, when you look at the flow down to EPS, there are a couple of things that I want to point out. A, cost of goods is up since the last guidance, right, by about 50 basis points at the midpoint. Big part of that is driven by COVID-19 and some incremental freight costs. Those incremental costs, we expect to have to pay our suppliers for some of our key ingredients for the product. So that's one area that impacts the flow down to the bottom line. We did take cuts in SG&A about $100 million at the midpoint, as we've discussed. Well, we also do have additional interest expense. The previous guidance was $215 million. Current guidance is approximately $250 million, and that does take into account the fact that we will earn less interest income on our cash. And it also does contemplate that we may incur some additional debt throughout the year. So it's really the cost of goods and the interest expense that offsets some of the benefits that we were seeing in the other expense line that are impacting the EPS.\nOperator: We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much for the questions. Maybe just the first one, just a clarification on the top line guidance update. I know you've touched on this on a high level, but can you just quantify how much of the sales revision are these kind of near-term COVID disruptions? Are people just not able to get to production sites and not able to see the vets versus how much is longer-term recession-related headwind? And maybe in the same vein, how much of the reduction is livestock versus companion? Is it 50-50? Is it 60-40? Any color there? My second kind of bigger picture question was on the companion side of the business and how sensitive that part of the portfolio is to a recession. Is that should we think about that business being more insulated than livestock? Or is there also some potential sensitivity we have to think about on that portion of the portfolio? Thanks so much.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll take pet care, and then Glenn can take overall guidance. With regards to pet care, in previous recessions, it has been a very resilient industry, and we think it will continue to be. I think if you look at the hit in Q2, it really obviously, recession impacts it, but less than most other sectors. But Q2 with people not going to the vet, which is not necessarily right now in Q2 recession, it was more related to the pandemic and the quarantine situation. And as you look at it, we still have a very strong portfolio that doesn't even require you to go to the vet. So even vet visit isn't always a great proxy for our business, since a lot of our products can be bought online. But there are a percentage of our business that's more in clinic. We're seeing much greater impact, for example, in diagnostics. But for us, diagnostics is only 5% of our business. So we do think pet care will be quite resilient in the medium to long-term and will bounce back. And it has historically, as Glenn mentioned, been quite resilient historically. But I think Glenn can do a good job of putting in context our assumptions as if we trend through the year at the high end of the guidance versus the low end of the guidance for both pet care and livestock.\nGlenn David: Yes. So Chris, I'll just address your first question, and then we'll get into a little more of the details on the guidance. So in terms of COVID versus the recession, obviously, we think Q2 will be the most severely impacted, and COVID will be a big driver of that in both livestock and companion animal. In terms of then going forward, we do expect an impact from the recession, and we do expect that the recessionary impact will be more impactful on livestock than companion animal based on the reasons that Kristin just shared. However, I think when you look at the overall guidance, right, we did do a bottoms-up analysis to inform the guidance range because we do believe that the people in the markets are closest to this and have the best information. And what we got back was pretty clear that Q2 will be the hardest hit due to the impact of social distancing and the recession and the fact that the companion animal visits will be lowest in Q2, and livestock plant closures will also impact the livestock side of the business. When you look at the second half of the year, the high end of the guidance range assumes that the recessionary impacts continue, but that companion animal visits return to more normalized levels and that our livestock producers return to full operations. If you look at the lower end of the revenue range, that really assumes a very deep recession and also contemplates a potential second wave of the virus with social distancing measures negatively impacting both companion animal and livestock further in the second half of the year. So we're really just trying to be very transparent with investors as we always do, which is why we chose to provide the guidance with a broader range. However, as we look to the long-term future of both the industry and our business, we do expect that we will return to more normalized growth rates that we see in terms of revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I know you mentioned that, the online alternative channels is a little bit more of a low base, but we have seen a speed up in the adoption curve of online pharmacies. Now as we look to compliance in maybe the back half of the year, I mean, do you think \u2013 could we see maybe some upside from reorders that we not \u2013 would normally not see? And then my second question is a little bit more continued granularity on the guidance. So when we're looking at \u2013 in the last week, I think I've seen some data and talking to clinics about normalization almost in the last week. So when we're looking at Q2, I mean, should we assume the last couple of weeks is something that could happen in Q2? And I know that your crystal ball might not necessarily be perfect here. But just as we're modeling that, it's moving so fast, and it does seem like there's some positive bounce back in the last week. I just want to be fairly accurate in the way we're modeling that, so, thank you.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, David. I'll start with the online channels, and I'll let Glenn pick up your question on the more detailed guidance and what you're seeing as the trends right now in vet visits. The online channels have been a significant trend. I'd say from a few different places. And if they continue, I do think there is an upside with regards to compliance. We've seen a significant uptick in vets signing up for Covetrus as vet's first choice and vet source to make sure that their pet owners get their products, if they \u2013 even if they feel uncomfortable coming into the vet. We have seen \u2013 and they publish as well studies that once you get a customer on to your online home delivery that their compliance goes up, because it ships once a month and there's less of the stress. So we do think that's a potential upside. And again, it really just accelerated a trend that we thought would happen, but we have seen significant growth in that channel for us. And I think that's why, as I said before, our portfolio has been more resilient in some other companies, as many of our products you can get from home delivery. The other big channel that's been quite \u2013 growing quite quickly for us remains e-commerce. So Chewy has also increased its sales dramatically with us. Again, I want to go back to Glenn's earlier point. This is off a very low base. This was historically a very small percentage. It is growing very quickly and we do think, especially now consumers would like to get more shipped directly to them. So I think this is a trend that we're going to continue to see. And we do think it does have the upside over the medium term to improve compliance overall with pet owners. So that is a potential upside. I'll let Glenn take the rest of your questions with regards to guidance.\nGlenn David: Yes. So in terms of guidance and for Q2 in particular, in some of the trends that we're seeing in the more current weeks, I think it's important, a, to break it out between the U.S. and international. So again, reminding because of our international close, Q2 for us will be the month of March, April and May. So recovery in terms of visits, we'll have a smaller benefit in international because it only applies to the end of April and early May. When you look at the U.S. however, in early April we were seeing visits down 20% to 30%. But to your point, we have seen those numbers begin to rise pretty significantly. And to the extent that that continues, that could limit the impact that we would expect to see in Q2, particularly on the companion animal side of the business. So those are positive trends and we hope that those trends do continue.\nOperator: Our next question is from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So Kristin could I \u2013 we're discussed much about the near-term impact in with what we're likely to see in Q2 and Q3. Can I take a step back here and ask you about the longer term implications of COVID-19 on both livestock and companion animal side? How do you think about the change in industry dynamics here with user behavior, veterinary practices, meat producers and what it means more importantly for the long-term industry growth numbers that were discussed in both the companion animal and livestock side? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks. Absolutely, we very much still believe the longer term trends for this industry are very strong. If you look at the trend of the humanization of pets, I actually think has been accelerated. So as you look at the next few years of people likely spending more time at home, less travel, maybe potentially working from home more. They're around their pets longer, they tend to therefore want to take better care of them. They also tend to notice issues before they might have noticed them historically. So we think really the long-term trend here is very positive. And we'll continue the humanization of pets. And the only thing that will temper that is obviously a recession. But again, as we said in previous recessions, there has been quite a resilient space. I think as you look at the longer term trend in livestock, I think for the next, say as we've talked about this year, there's some significant impacts to many of our producers. But over the medium to long-term, feeding the world is an important secular trend that is not going to change. So supply chains will realign themselves so that it's more \u2013 it goes to the grocery store, we'll be better aligned to do that. They'll change it in the sense of dine-in, dine-out. They'll also evolve across species. So it may be that you will see poultry and pork do better over the short to medium-term. But in the end of the day, as we've seen over and over again in other crises and recessions, feeding the world is a strong secular trend. So we remain quite optimistic for the industry and specifically for our portfolio. If you look at our portfolio, it's very diversified and that has been very good for us over the years with about half in the U.S., half outside the U.S. with a 50/50 split between livestock and companion animals and watching that evolve. So we're very optimistic, continue to believe that the industry and more importantly, Zoetis will be resilient.\nOperator: Next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Risinger: Thanks very much. Sorry about that. So congrats on the Pumpkin innovative and compelling offering, it certainly differentiated. Could you help us understand the insurance element of the promotional offering including acute illness coverage and exactly what Zoetis is pitching to pet owners with respect to the insurance aspect? And then just a side comment with respect to the second wave that you're modeling, you're assuming that second wave in the fourth quarter, not this summer. Correct?\nKristin Peck: Okay. So I'll start with the insurance. I'll let Glenn take the question on the second wave. We're very excited about Pumpkin. What we think truly differentiates it is a preventative wellness plan. The insurance, again, we are not taking underwriting risk in this that is taken by Crum & Forster. I can't get into comparing individual plans. Obviously, it would depend on your pet, its age, as always all insurance does. I would say the insurance is a very strong insurance plans, but there's many comparable ones on the insurance. The unique part of the offering is the real focus on the additional preventative wellness plans or I think we have a very unique offering there and it's quite differentiated. But from an insurance perspective, it's quite competitive with other things out there. I wouldn't say the insurance alone is as differentiated. I would say how we work with our customers, the customer experience is quite differentiated. If you've checked it out and gone to the website, we're trying to make it easier for pet owners, simpler to understand, simpler to file claims. So we're really looking to innovate on user experience with regards to the insurance part of it. But the plan itself is comparable. What's really different is the additional preventative wellness plan, which I think is quite different. But I'll let Glenn take the question on the second wave.\nGlenn David: Yes. And in terms of the second wave, again, that's one of the assumptions within the lower end of our guidance range. We would anticipate that that would occur later in the year. Not necessarily in the coming months.\nOperator: We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Just two quick questions for me. First, Kristin, just going back to your comment on Simparica Trio, could you maybe share some of the initial feedback that you've gotten from that? And how receptive do you think they might need to kind of using this product as the year-round treatment and potentially kind of switching has midyear. And then have you seen any change in your response from competitors that\u2019s factored into your outlook? That's kind of the first question. The second question for Glenn, I think the companion animal growth rate internationally I think slowed a little bit from what the recent trend has been. Could you maybe just go into more details on what you saw there on the quarter?\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks Nathan. If you look at Trio, we think our customers have been quite receptive. They've been excited. This has been a highly anticipated product and the reception from many of our vets having something exciting and new to discuss with their pet owners to make sure that they can take care of a deadly disease like heartworm. And combine that with one of the best flea and tick products.  It's been quite positive. We've been seeing a pickup even more in the last few weeks as vets have had more time to engage. So, honestly, from the market \u2013 the vets have been very excited. We've seen great receptivity to our direct-to-consumer advertising. As we saw from some of our competitors, they did exactly what we expected. They definitely build the channel with as much product as they could in Q1 before our launch, as we had talked about at our Q4 call that was anticipated. And obviously, they will come after us, as they should. This is the single largest sector as you know in animal health and in the U.S. alone it\u2019s a $2.5 billion market. So we're really excited. We continue to see, as you saw our guidance that this will drive significant growth for us overall as a company and certainly in the U.S. And we have been very pleased with the receptivity of both vets and pet owners to this new innovation. So Glenn, do you want to take this companion animal question?\nGlenn David: Yes. So in terms of a companion animal in the international market, so we did see good growth of 8% in companion animal in the international markets. There were a couple of things that did factor into limiting that growth to some degree. So a, China grew 8%, which was actually a little below our expectations because of the impact of COVID-19 and the timing of COVID-19 within that market. We also did see declines in markets such as Italy and Canada. Italy was changed \u2013 was impacted by some changes in prescribing laws that we think again will recover it through the rest of the year. Whereas Canada was impacted somewhat by the timing of the launch of Simparica Trio, there was a hold on some of the sales for Simparica Trio from our customers in anticipation of Simparica Trio being provided shortly thereafter.\nOperator: The next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nKathy Miner: Thank you for taking the question. Just going to follow up a little bit more on the dermatology business, specifically, was there any stocking of Apoquel in the first quarter? And second of all, can you comment on Cytopoint, you've indicated that there was growth in the quarter and since this is a vet visit kind of product, just talk about those dynamics and how you see that as we get into Q2 and later in the year? And if there's any difference in this U.S. versus O-U.S. also. Thank you.\nGlenn David: Sure. So from Apoquel perspective and just from a broader companion animal perspective, we did not see stocking within the quarter. This is something that we monitor and manage very closely and we prefer ourselves to mirror our underlying demand. So we did not see significant stocking in the quarter of any extent. And when you look at the breakout between Apoquel and Cytopoint, they both perform very well in the quarter, but Cytopoint did actually grow more rapidly as we think the convenience and the compliance and the fact that it is administered in the clinic certainly does help Cytopoint. We also saw very rapid growth in Cytopoint in international, growing approximately 71% as it was introduced in new markets as well so very strong performance across the entire portfolio of both Cytopoint and Apoquel.\nOperator: Our next question is from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nElliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. Question on return to baseline or normalcy trends in terms of vet visits on the companion animal side. Assuming that, in effect, does happen near year-end or sometime in the second half of 2020 at least, how are you thinking about and how should we think about revenue per visit? Is there a possibility of a trade-down effect? Is that something that you've incorporated into expectations? And maybe any color from \u2013 experienced during the Great recession with respect to that aspect of vet visits would be helpful. And just real quickly, if you could \u2013 could you just remind us of the relative margins within the livestock business between cattle versus swine and poultry? Thanks.\nGlenn David: Sure. So in terms of the relative margins across the livestock business, they actually are starting to converge across them. But in general, cattle is a higher margin, then comes swine and then comes poultry, but they're all relatively close. And then in terms of the revenue per visit. So, a, in the first quarter, we did see very positive trends in terms of revenue per visit in companion animal. We get most of that data honestly within the U.S. So we haven't seen anything telling us that revenue per visit is declining significantly, but that is something that we will track throughout the year, but we have no data that indicates that, that is a trend that should reverse at any time soon.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Greg Gilbert with SunTrust. Please go ahead.\nGreg Gilbert: Thank you. I know that you and others are offering telehealth to vet customers. Can you talk about how that's being embraced and how that could affect the business longer term? And then secondly, what are you seeing in Asia? I realize it's early days, but what are you seeing in terms of a return to normal or an attempt to return to normal both from your own employee base as well as the customer base. In the U.S., we see a lot of companies guiding to some return to normal for their business by year-end, but those companies that are guiding have employees who are terrified to go back to work anytime soon. So just trying to \u2013 maybe that's a very U.S. sort of New York centric way of thinking. But I'm hoping you can offer some color from a more global perspective. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks so much, Greg. I'll start with looking at China. China really has come back. They have about 80% to 90% of vet clinics are now open. And they are seeing pet owners return, but they do \u2013 the pet owners do remain cautious. So I wouldn't say it's at exactly the same level. But if you look at \u2013 and we have significant operations in China. We are continuing to operate our manufacturing sites and other sites there. And our experience there is the measures that the government has put in place to control the virus and to do staggered shifts, et cetera and track and trace are not measures that so far, most of Europe and the U.S. are willing or are able to implement anyway. The ability to look at that as a proxy, we don't think that is a good proxy for what a return to the workplace looks like in the U.S. and in Europe. They're just \u2013 what they've done there is quite different. We did see a strong growth in China. As you look at Q1, they grew 13%, with 19% in livestock and 9% in companion animal. But we caution that looking at China and extrapolating to the rest of the world is probably not the best strategy. We do see and we've put a lot of focus in what a return to work looks like. We are leveraging our experience in our manufacturing sites, distribution and R&D sites that have been operational as an essential business throughout. And our plan is to leverage those learnings, where we looked at implementing health and hygiene measures such as social distancing, increased sanitization, temp checks and staggered shifts, and that is certainly the way we're looking to do that in the U.S. I think we talk a lot about office-based colleagues but field-based colleagues is another big category for us. And so we think it's going to take a little longer, and we'll obviously be leveraging other opportunities such as telehealth with \u2013 and webinars and things like that with our customers. We need to make sure that as our colleagues return, the customers are comfortable too. It's got to be two-sided. And with regards to your question, specifically on telehealth, we did see a quick uptick initially. It is a process change for clinics. So whether or not and at what level that really continues to take off, it's still early days. I've actually been doing a telehealth visit. I'd say it does help the vet do really simple checkups on a procedure to just make sure the pet\u2019s okay. Remotely, it is actually more efficient and to get them paid for something that sometimes they call a customer and they were never paid for. So I do think it will take off, but it is a big process flow change for the vet and even integration to the system. So I think it will take a little time to see how fast that picks up. But we've heard a positive reception for most of our customers who've started to adopt it, but it does take a little time.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead. Navin, check the mute button on your phone. Your line is open. We\u2019ll go to the next one. We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with a follow-up. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: On channel and your opportunity to move over there. Could you just given us an overview of the companion animal product portfolio you have now between vaccines and other injectables like Cytopoint? There's a large part of the product that simply cannot be moved on. And then on the other hand, you have parasiticides, growing presence there, Apoquel, other products that with a prescription, you can get it from Chewy and from other sites. Could you just discuss how Zoetis is positioned here in the online channel? And sort of big picture, do you anticipate COVID could drive a longer-term shift to more online pharmacy purchases, as opposed to people going to the vet. If people are trying to continue to practice some social distancing longer term?\nKristin Peck: Sure. As we look at our portfolio, the first thing I'd start with is almost all of our portfolio does require a prescription. So the vet will remain at the center of anything that happens. But to your question of sort of where they get products over whether it's in the clinic, through home delivery, via the clinic website or through Chewy, is really a focus. As you look about our portfolio, about 50% of our portfolio generally would be given in clinic. That would be a vaccine, an injectable, a surgical, something for urgent care, et cetera, and about 50% of our portfolio could eventually go to home delivery or online. And I think you're seeing the acceleration of that as we look at the sort of the pandemic impact overall in Q1. And I think that will continue to accelerate. But if you look at a lot of this, it still requires a wellness visit, it still requires a prescription. So the vet will stay center. But I do think you're seeing a real acceleration in home delivery and in places like Chewy. It has the upside of driving compliance, as we've talked about before and we do believe it will. We'll see how fast it continues to go. But I think once you get a customer in the habit of a monthly home delivery, it certainly makes their lives easier. And it will drive compliance overall.\nOperator: And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Kristin, for closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks so much. These are certainly unprecedented times. But the one thing, as I started out with, Zoetis as an essential business has also been a quite resilient company, and I'm quite proud of what our colleagues across the world have done to ensure that they've taken care of each other and supported our customers. Medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and many of our solutions will remain essential in the months and years to come. We think Zoetis has a diverse portfolio that addresses a broad spectrum of needs, and given the diversification of our portfolio and our very strong balance sheet, we believe that Zoetis is strongly positioned to manage certainly over this year and in the years to come. We're driven by two very important secular trends, both the humanization of pets and ensuring we feed the world. So we remain quite optimistic as we look to the end of 2020 and 2021 that Zoetis and our industry will continue to be essential and resilient. Thanks so much for joining us today.\nOperator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. I think it's fair to say the past few months have been unlike any we've ever experienced in business or that any of us could have imagined for our families, friends and communities. The global COVID-19 pandemic has had such an incredible impact on our world and for many of us personally. It has given me a chance to reflect, not just on the financial numbers we reported today, but on the true value our business provides society, the role we play in public health, the support we deliver for our customers in crisis and the safety and security we provide to our colleagues. For Zoetis, we're privileged to play an essential role in sustaining and protecting animal and human life during the outbreak. Our products and services play a critical part in animal health, helping support pet care and the food supply, and we've continued to manufacture products and serve customers even in places that have imposed stringent limits on businesses in the wake of the coronavirus. Our colleagues are more committed than ever to supporting the nutrition and comfort that animals provide the world and that purpose has motivated us to continue serving our customers and communities in these extraordinary times. I'm especially proud of the efforts of Zoetis colleagues in supporting our local communities, healthcare workers and businesses during the outbreak. We've been contributing surplus personal protective equipment from our operations. We've been increasing production of human health diagnostics and answering requests from local hospitals for a variety of assistance. As far as the direct impact of COVID-19 on our colleagues, we've been fortunate to see only a small number of COVID-19 cases in our workforce of more than 10,000 colleagues. Thanks to increased safety measures, hygiene protocols and adjustments to our operations. About 70% of our colleagues today are working remotely. They are being productive as they adjust to new arrangements, juggle new home and family responsibilities and benefit from the use of technology infrastructure that we've invested in and continue to enhance at this time. The other 30% of our colleagues are working at our sites supporting essential operations such as manufacturing, distribution and logistics, clinical trials and research and technical services and support for customers. Our teams in Zoetis sites are adhering to strict health and hygiene protocols recommended by the WHO and CDC. They're practicing social distancing, operating in staggered shifts and participating in health monitoring, all as part of the adjustments we've made at each plant to limit potential exposure. Our 30 manufacturing sites remain open around the globe today and we've been able to maintain supply of critical product inventories. We've also shown excellent agility to deal with the local market changes in terms of border controls, regulatory changes and freight operations. I'm also pleased to say that even under these difficult circumstances, we were able to meet our launch timing for Simparica Trio, our highly anticipated triple combination parasiticide. We launched Simparica Trio in the UK, Spain, and Italy in February. Made initial shipments for distribution in the U.S. in March and initiated the full launch in the U.S. and Canada in April, with more markets to follow. We've seen significant interest in Trio and we've been supporting its introduction with consumer ads in the U.S. this spring. While we're excited by the introduction and the receptiveness of customers and pet owners, we've had to revisit full year projections for Simparica Trio, given the expected impact of COVID-19 and the recession. Glenn will speak more to this in his remarks. We are grateful, we've been able to keep our major R&D programs on track. We continue to advance our research in key areas such as monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in cats and dogs and vector vaccines for poultry. We're continuing with regulatory reviews, commissions are going in and we're maintaining momentum at our most critical projects for the future, all while keeping colleagues safe. From a P&L perspective, in the first quarter, the pandemic had a limited impact on our results given the February quarter-end for international markets and the timing of shelter in place across the U.S. We generated 7% operational growth in revenue and 10% operational growth in adjusted net income, thanks to the strength of our diverse portfolio and global scope of our business. We expect a more significant revenue impact from COVID-19 in Q2 and for the year as the lockdowns and recession have a continued impact on our business, especially in terms of traffic at companion animal clinics and reduction in demand for protein from their restaurant and dine out sectors. We will need to watch carefully how the reopening of various markets in the coming weeks impact veterinary services for companion animals as well as livestock. Glenn will discuss 2020 guidance in more detail in a few minutes, but I'm pleased to share that Zoetis remains a resilient company at times like these, given the essential nature of our business and our diverse portfolio. In most markets, our sales teams are working virtually to respect local government guidance and limit potential exposure of COVID-19 for colleagues and customers. We've been keeping in regular contact with our customers through phone calls, video conferences, webinars and surveys. And we're responding as best we can to anticipate and address their most important needs. We're here to help them maintain critical care and supply for their customers at this time and adapt to a new normal for the future of animal care. For example, we've been advising customers on increasing digital content for their use of pet owners, offering telemedicine solutions through new partnerships, discussing their liquidity concerns, offering continuing education for veterinary staff and providing technical support services to deal with adjustments being made to food production. We are seeing many of the trends you are in terms of animal health and food supply as well as decreased traffic to veterinary practices, but history tells us that animal health medicines, vaccines and other products remain essential even in a challenging economy. On the livestock side of the business, the need for food hasn't gone away, but with restaurants and hotels closed, consumer demand has shifted to supermarkets. There's less demand for beef and dairy products while poultry remains strong as people choose less expensive proteins. As with every front-line business today, the biggest challenge our livestock customers are having is maintaining their operations with enough healthy workers to handle processing, packing, and delivering food. On the pet side of the business, veterinary traffic is down in places where containment measures are in place. Now, many vets are leveraging curbside check-ins, home visits, telemedicine and online pharmacy distribution to take the place of in-clinic visits. As you look ahead, our business continuity plans are working well and we continue to show great agility and responsiveness to this crisis. We are carefully managing our expenses and doing scenario planning for the medium and long-term, including hiring freezes and rejections to discretionary spending such as travel, entertainment and consulting. We have not had to engage in furloughs or salary reductions for our colleagues. Thanks to the resiliency and diversification of our business and our strong balance sheet. We continue to regularly assess any long-term needs depending on the duration of the pandemic and the resulting recession. Like all companies, we begun planning for the days when more of our colleagues will return to the workplace. Over the last few months, we have safely maintained operations in our manufacturing distribution and R&D facilities to ensure continuous supply to our customers while maintaining strict quality standards and keeping our colleagues safe. We plan to leverage these enhanced policies and procedures for a phased return to work that helps ensure the safety of not just our colleagues, but the customers they interact within the field. I am proud of our teams for their resourcefulness, flexibility and commitment to colleagues and customers. Their efforts are helping us to envision an even better way to work over the long-term. When we began this year, my first as CEO, I laid out five priorities for Zoetis and those are as relevant today as they were then. Our priorities remain driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. As we managed through the crisis to this new normal, we will find relevant new ways to adapt our strategies and tactics for the future. Even in the midst of COVID-19, we continue to act on opportunities to advance these priorities. Since February, we received approval of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and Australia and have launched it in several markets with the support of direct-to-consumer advertising and digital marketing where applicable. We acquired Performance Livestock Analytics, a company which brings us proven cloud-based management systems and data analytics for beef producers. And we announced Pumpkin, a new pet health startup is offering pet insurance and preventative care in the U.S. Once again, I'm very proud of the results we've been able to deliver this quarter and I look forward to your questions. Now, let me hand over to Glenn for more detail on the first quarter results and our updated view for the rest of 2020. Glenn? Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll talk a little bit about some of the broader trends and then I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about what that means overall and guidance and how that translates. If we start at the vet clinic side and the pet care side. Q1, there really was limited impact just given the timing of the quarantine decisions across the world, and China tended to rebound a little bit. As we moved into early April, we did see significant impacts about \u2013 to about 20% to 30% reduction in the U.S., and in Europe, 30% to 50%. The very good news right now is that those are turning around quite quickly. We're seeing a significant improvement both in the U.S. and Europe in overall clinic visits. And so our expectation is obviously, overall a week Q2, but that will improve in Q3 and Q4, also because we strongly believe that that's our \u2013 being very thoughtful about how they increase their business, leveraging telemedicine, curbside, drop off, lots of different strategies there. As you look at the livestock sector, I mean, there are two big trends impacting this. The first is the shift out of dine-out and into grocery stores. Historically that was about a 50-50 split. And now about 80% to 90% of consumption is coming out of grocery stores. Historically those supply chains were quite different. So the channel migration there has been a little challenging as you've seen. And the second trend there has been an exacerbated in the U.S. specifically around the reduction and the battery, and at this point about a 15% reduction of processing capacity, given some of the outbreaks at some of those sites, which continues to be obviously in the news every day. Again, the good news is that's a U.S. trend and that trend is not relevant internationally. But what we do see sort of in the medium term as we look into Q2, Q3, Q4, as this will put a pressure on our customers, on livestock producers, it is decreasing price and therefore their profitability. It's likely going to decrease their herd size and also put pressure on their import costs and potentially have them trade down. The question is, how fast that works through? It's quick to work through that in poultry, a little more challenging in swine and in catalyst we've seen \u2013 that really is just exacerbating as Glenn mentioned in his remarks, a trend we've been seeing for awhile. We strongly believe the long-term fundamentals remain strong in all these sectors. So the animal protein consumption will continue to grow. So I think a lot of this is a more of an impact as we work through some of these dynamics this year and the humanization of pets has never been more important than it is now, as you've seeing on adoptions of animals, and in previous recessions it's pretty resilient. But I'll let Glenn sort of talk through how he thinks about those trends as we did our guidance. Thanks, Erin. I'll start off and let Glenn build on it. We've been very excited at the very strong awareness and anticipation for the launch of the really innovative Simparica Trio. We did see stocking, as I think we mentioned in Q1, of around $15 million. That was really just the distribution. We did the full launch to vets and to customers in April, and we followed that shortly thereafter with a very strong direct-to-consumer advertising push, which has been very well received. We remain very excited about this product. However, we are cognizant that with the pandemic, social distancing as well as the recession, the outlook for 2020 will be adjusted. I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about that guidance. But outside the U.S., we launched in February in the U.K., Italy and Spain. We also recently launched in Canada. So we've remain very excited about the potential for this product, and we think we'll have a very good 2020, and we're pleased given \u2013 at the launch so far, and given what we're facing with the pandemic. But I'll let Glenn talk a little bit about the updated guidance. Sure. Thanks, Louise. Unfortunately, I do not think they are noise, but they're indeed , very real to our customers. It is taking a large part of our field force and technical services supporting our customers through this. Shedding some of these packing plants and having 15% of the capacity of the U.S. packing taken offline, backs up significantly to our producers. They have nowhere to put animals. We are an economy in the livestock space that was just in time, and they were \u2013 trying to make sure they were as efficient as possible. So it is a quite serious issue for our producers, and it does have impact that will be important in 2020. It is decreasing the price that they're willing to pay. They don't need the animals. So they're paying less for them. That significantly hurts the profitability of our customers and certainly would courage them at this point to reduce herd sizes. So it does have an impact. As I was trying to express before, some of that impact, as you look at it, it can be turned around quite quickly in poultry, where 43 days, you can make some new decisions there to expand production. There's a little more time in pork. The effects took a lot longer to work through in the beef side. So we do think they will have an impact in 2020 significantly on the livestock side that was baked into the guidance we provided. But I'll let Glenn talk a little bit more to that. Sure. I'll start on Pumpkin, and then Glenn can follow-up on the derm question, John. We're very excited about the launch of Pumpkin. I think it's actually never been more relevant than it is as we enter a recession. The focus of the Pumpkin insurance and preventative plans is really increasing access to care. It's one of the biggest issues that pet owners have and their vet struggle with is, what's the price? Can they get a pet and can they afford care? And really the new value proposition that we were trying to offer vets and pet owners is a real focus on preventative. So our plan is unique and it really helps cover it completely two to three core vaccines for dogs and for cats, parasiticides for the year and that wellness visit, which is an important part. Many pet owners didn't want to get pet insurance in the U.S. because they felt like it only paid \"if their animal got sick\". And under the new wave that we have combined the insurance and the preventative care plan, we think pet owners will see the value at day one. And so although there are some changes to where that goes for a vet clinic, ensuring that those animals will be coming in regularly because that is a visit that's paid for, for the vaccines and the wellness visits and the parasiticides, we think, really does help the veterinarian. So as we sat down, I think there was a lot of \u2013 I think, from some of our competitors, noise around that when it first launched. But as we sat down to explain the vet, what we're paying for overall in a wellness visit, how we'll be encouraging that, how we'll be covering vaccines. I think veterinarians are quite excited at the opportunity as many new people have adopted pets. And the opportunity in the space overall, in the U.S., with penetration levels of pet insurance very low at 2%, 3% versus the rest of the world at 20%, 30%, 40%, is significant And we think, especially going into recession, this is an important part of ensuring that pets get the care and that they go to the vet to get that care. So I'll turn it over to Glenn to comment on the derm. Sure, John. Great question. No, you did not miss the what is the new market projection to be. The groups that project the market growth, obviously, has not been able to do that yet, and this is a fast emerging. So there is no general sense. As we look at it, we continue to see that pet care will probably have the strongest growth globally overall, followed by poultry. As we look at the swine growth overall, although that we're seeing significant impacts in the U.S. right now, given ASF in China and really the strong demand that China is going to continue to have to import swine, we think swine will likely be okay. It will probably have some impact but will do better. And we see the greatest impact overall in cattle. As you look at our business, we're about 50% companion animal, 50% livestock. So it really \u2013 we haven't seen updated market growth numbers to how we compare to that. But we think we will be doing better than the market. And I think it might be helpful. Glenn can talk a little bit about you use the midpoint of the range, but we'll talk a little bit what the assumptions are for us at the high end of the range and what the assumptions are at the lower end of the range to help you better navigate that. So I'll let Glenn take that question as well as the EPS. Sure. I'll take pet care, and then Glenn can take overall guidance. With regards to pet care, in previous recessions, it has been a very resilient industry, and we think it will continue to be. I think if you look at the hit in Q2, it really obviously, recession impacts it, but less than most other sectors. But Q2 with people not going to the vet, which is not necessarily right now in Q2 recession, it was more related to the pandemic and the quarantine situation. And as you look at it, we still have a very strong portfolio that doesn't even require you to go to the vet. So even vet visit isn't always a great proxy for our business, since a lot of our products can be bought online. But there are a percentage of our business that's more in clinic. We're seeing much greater impact, for example, in diagnostics. But for us, diagnostics is only 5% of our business. So we do think pet care will be quite resilient in the medium to long-term and will bounce back. And it has historically, as Glenn mentioned, been quite resilient historically. But I think Glenn can do a good job of putting in context our assumptions as if we trend through the year at the high end of the guidance versus the low end of the guidance for both pet care and livestock. Thanks, David. I'll start with the online channels, and I'll let Glenn pick up your question on the more detailed guidance and what you're seeing as the trends right now in vet visits. The online channels have been a significant trend. I'd say from a few different places. And if they continue, I do think there is an upside with regards to compliance. We've seen a significant uptick in vets signing up for Covetrus as vet's first choice and vet source to make sure that their pet owners get their products, if they \u2013 even if they feel uncomfortable coming into the vet. We have seen \u2013 and they publish as well studies that once you get a customer on to your online home delivery that their compliance goes up, because it ships once a month and there's less of the stress. So we do think that's a potential upside. And again, it really just accelerated a trend that we thought would happen, but we have seen significant growth in that channel for us. And I think that's why, as I said before, our portfolio has been more resilient in some other companies, as many of our products you can get from home delivery. The other big channel that's been quite \u2013 growing quite quickly for us remains e-commerce. So Chewy has also increased its sales dramatically with us. Again, I want to go back to Glenn's earlier point. This is off a very low base. This was historically a very small percentage. It is growing very quickly and we do think, especially now consumers would like to get more shipped directly to them. So I think this is a trend that we're going to continue to see. And we do think it does have the upside over the medium term to improve compliance overall with pet owners. So that is a potential upside. I'll let Glenn take the rest of your questions with regards to guidance. Thanks. Absolutely, we very much still believe the longer term trends for this industry are very strong. If you look at the trend of the humanization of pets, I actually think has been accelerated. So as you look at the next few years of people likely spending more time at home, less travel, maybe potentially working from home more. They're around their pets longer, they tend to therefore want to take better care of them. They also tend to notice issues before they might have noticed them historically. So we think really the long-term trend here is very positive. And we'll continue the humanization of pets. And the only thing that will temper that is obviously a recession. But again, as we said in previous recessions, there has been quite a resilient space. I think as you look at the longer term trend in livestock, I think for the next, say as we've talked about this year, there's some significant impacts to many of our producers. But over the medium to long-term, feeding the world is an important secular trend that is not going to change. So supply chains will realign themselves so that it's more \u2013 it goes to the grocery store, we'll be better aligned to do that. They'll change it in the sense of dine-in, dine-out. They'll also evolve across species. So it may be that you will see poultry and pork do better over the short to medium-term. But in the end of the day, as we've seen over and over again in other crises and recessions, feeding the world is a strong secular trend. So we remain quite optimistic for the industry and specifically for our portfolio. If you look at our portfolio, it's very diversified and that has been very good for us over the years with about half in the U.S., half outside the U.S. with a 50/50 split between livestock and companion animals and watching that evolve. So we're very optimistic, continue to believe that the industry and more importantly, Zoetis will be resilient. Okay. So I'll start with the insurance. I'll let Glenn take the question on the second wave. We're very excited about Pumpkin. What we think truly differentiates it is a preventative wellness plan. The insurance, again, we are not taking underwriting risk in this that is taken by Crum & Forster. I can't get into comparing individual plans. Obviously, it would depend on your pet, its age, as always all insurance does. I would say the insurance is a very strong insurance plans, but there's many comparable ones on the insurance. The unique part of the offering is the real focus on the additional preventative wellness plans or I think we have a very unique offering there and it's quite differentiated. But from an insurance perspective, it's quite competitive with other things out there. I wouldn't say the insurance alone is as differentiated. I would say how we work with our customers, the customer experience is quite differentiated. If you've checked it out and gone to the website, we're trying to make it easier for pet owners, simpler to understand, simpler to file claims. So we're really looking to innovate on user experience with regards to the insurance part of it. But the plan itself is comparable. What's really different is the additional preventative wellness plan, which I think is quite different. But I'll let Glenn take the question on the second wave. Sure. Thanks Nathan. If you look at Trio, we think our customers have been quite receptive. They've been excited. This has been a highly anticipated product and the reception from many of our vets having something exciting and new to discuss with their pet owners to make sure that they can take care of a deadly disease like heartworm. And combine that with one of the best flea and tick products.  It's been quite positive. We've been seeing a pickup even more in the last few weeks as vets have had more time to engage. So, honestly, from the market \u2013 the vets have been very excited. We've seen great receptivity to our direct-to-consumer advertising. As we saw from some of our competitors, they did exactly what we expected. They definitely build the channel with as much product as they could in Q1 before our launch, as we had talked about at our Q4 call that was anticipated. And obviously, they will come after us, as they should. This is the single largest sector as you know in animal health and in the U.S. alone it's a $2.5 billion market. So we're really excited. We continue to see, as you saw our guidance that this will drive significant growth for us overall as a company and certainly in the U.S. And we have been very pleased with the receptivity of both vets and pet owners to this new innovation. So Glenn, do you want to take this companion animal question? Sure. Thanks so much, Greg. I'll start with looking at China. China really has come back. They have about 80% to 90% of vet clinics are now open. And they are seeing pet owners return, but they do \u2013 the pet owners do remain cautious. So I wouldn't say it's at exactly the same level. But if you look at \u2013 and we have significant operations in China. We are continuing to operate our manufacturing sites and other sites there. And our experience there is the measures that the government has put in place to control the virus and to do staggered shifts, et cetera and track and trace are not measures that so far, most of Europe and the U.S. are willing or are able to implement anyway. The ability to look at that as a proxy, we don't think that is a good proxy for what a return to the workplace looks like in the U.S. and in Europe. They're just \u2013 what they've done there is quite different. We did see a strong growth in China. As you look at Q1, they grew 13%, with 19% in livestock and 9% in companion animal. But we caution that looking at China and extrapolating to the rest of the world is probably not the best strategy. We do see and we've put a lot of focus in what a return to work looks like. We are leveraging our experience in our manufacturing sites, distribution and R&D sites that have been operational as an essential business throughout. And our plan is to leverage those learnings, where we looked at implementing health and hygiene measures such as social distancing, increased sanitization, temp checks and staggered shifts, and that is certainly the way we're looking to do that in the U.S. I think we talk a lot about office-based colleagues but field-based colleagues is another big category for us. And so we think it's going to take a little longer, and we'll obviously be leveraging other opportunities such as telehealth with \u2013 and webinars and things like that with our customers. We need to make sure that as our colleagues return, the customers are comfortable too. It's got to be two-sided. And with regards to your question, specifically on telehealth, we did see a quick uptick initially. It is a process change for clinics. So whether or not and at what level that really continues to take off, it's still early days. I've actually been doing a telehealth visit. I'd say it does help the vet do really simple checkups on a procedure to just make sure the pet's okay. Remotely, it is actually more efficient and to get them paid for something that sometimes they call a customer and they were never paid for. So I do think it will take off, but it is a big process flow change for the vet and even integration to the system. So I think it will take a little time to see how fast that picks up. But we've heard a positive reception for most of our customers who've started to adopt it, but it does take a little time. Sure. As we look at our portfolio, the first thing I'd start with is almost all of our portfolio does require a prescription. So the vet will remain at the center of anything that happens. But to your question of sort of where they get products over whether it's in the clinic, through home delivery, via the clinic website or through Chewy, is really a focus. As you look about our portfolio, about 50% of our portfolio generally would be given in clinic. That would be a vaccine, an injectable, a surgical, something for urgent care, et cetera, and about 50% of our portfolio could eventually go to home delivery or online. And I think you're seeing the acceleration of that as we look at the sort of the pandemic impact overall in Q1. And I think that will continue to accelerate. But if you look at a lot of this, it still requires a wellness visit, it still requires a prescription. So the vet will stay center. But I do think you're seeing a real acceleration in home delivery and in places like Chewy. It has the upside of driving compliance, as we've talked about before and we do believe it will. We'll see how fast it continues to go. But I think once you get a customer in the habit of a monthly home delivery, it certainly makes their lives easier. And it will drive compliance overall. Thanks so much. These are certainly unprecedented times. But the one thing, as I started out with, Zoetis as an essential business has also been a quite resilient company, and I'm quite proud of what our colleagues across the world have done to ensure that they've taken care of each other and supported our customers. Medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and many of our solutions will remain essential in the months and years to come. We think Zoetis has a diverse portfolio that addresses a broad spectrum of needs, and given the diversification of our portfolio and our very strong balance sheet, we believe that Zoetis is strongly positioned to manage certainly over this year and in the years to come. We're driven by two very important secular trends, both the humanization of pets and ensuring we feed the world. So we remain quite optimistic as we look to the end of 2020 and 2021 that Zoetis and our industry will continue to be essential and resilient. Thanks so much for joining us today."

            "name": "Glenn David",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin and good morning. Echoing Kristin's comments, we find ourselves in a world we never imagined. I'm grateful for our colleagues as they balance new working arrangements, caring for their families, and keeping our essential business running during this crisis. Today I'll provide commentary on our Q1 results, provide clarity on our liquidity position and review our updated guidance for 2020. Historically, we know that Zoetis has remained a resilient company, given the essential nature of our business and our diverse portfolio. But no one yet knows the full extent, duration or implications that this pandemic will have. Our updated guidance reflects our best estimates based on what we know today. Beginning with the first quarter results, we generated revenue of $1.5 billion, representing an increase of 5% on a reported basis and 7% operationally. Adjusted net income of $455 million, increased 7% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Foreign exchange in the quarter drove an unfavorable 2% impact on revenue, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Operational revenue growth of 7% was driven by 3% price and 4% volume. Volume growth of 4% includes 2% from key dermatology products, 2% from new products, 1% from acquisitions, and a decline of 1% in other inline products. The first quarter was not materially impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19, given the February quarter end for our international markets and the timing of quarantine guidelines in the U.S. However, as indicated in our updated guidance ranges, we anticipate a more significant impact for the full year as the lockdowns and recessions have a continued impact on our business. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 10% operationally while livestock grew 3% operationally. Companion animal performance was driven by continued strength of our key dermatology products and parasiticide portfolio, which includes initial sales of Simparica Trio in both the U.S. and certain European markets. Revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance, which was acquired in the second half of 2019 and its nutritional products also contributed to strong equine growth. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong poultry, swine and fish performance partially offset by declines in cattle. New products contributed 2% to overall growth in the quarter, driven by some Simparica Trio and ProHeart 12 and our Alpha Flux parasiticide for fish in Chile. We remain very excited and confident in our ability to successfully launch Simparica Trio beginning with key markets in Europe and the U.S. However, we are now anticipating the incremental revenue for the full year to be in the range of $100 million to $125 million. The initial response from veterinarians has been extremely encouraging. However, due to the current COVID-19 situation, clinic penetration and adoption will be more gradual than initially expected. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $194 million in the quarter, growing 25% operationally and contributing 2% to overall revenue growth. The ongoing strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of APOQUEL, resulting from promotional investments, increased adoption of CYTOPOINT, as well as entry into new markets and price. Recent acquisitions and commercial agreements contributed 1% growth this quarter, which includes Platinum Performance, our reference lab acquisitions and the stable lab diagnostic test for equine. Other in-line products declined this quarter, primarily driven by declines in U.S. cattle related to ongoing beef and dairy market challenges. Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 9% with companion animal products growing 12% and livestock products growing 5%. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by increased sales of our key dermatology products, growth of the Simparica franchise and the impact of recent acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by declines in point-of-care diagnostics. U.S. key dermatology sales were $136 million for the quarter, growing, 31%. Growth this quarter was driven by ongoing promotional investments and expanded usage of CYTOPOINT in the clinic. Simparica Trio revenue in the quarter included initial sales, the distribution channels with product becoming available to veterinarians for prescribing in mid-April. We're supporting the launch with strong field force engagement and direct-to-consumer advertising. We remain confident in the long-term success of this product, despite launching within the current environment. Diagnostic sales in the quarter were primarily impacted by distributor purchasing patterns and slower demands in March related to COVID-19. U.S. livestock returned to growth this quarter, supported by positive performance in poultry and swine, partially offset by cattle declines. Poultry continues to benefit from our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives, driven by new customer adoption and efficacy challenges for a competitive product. Swine also had a strong quarter, driven by increased sales of any effectives and the one-time replenishment of a classical swine fever vaccine stockpile by the USDA. Cattle product sales continued to be negatively impacted by unfavorable beef market conditions driven by feedlot placements of heavier and healthier animals with a lower risk profile and dairy continue to face headwinds from negative producer profitability and oversupply. To summarize, U.S. performance was strong, despite ongoing challenges in U.S. and dairy cattle markets. Our International segment had operational revenue growth of 4% in the quarter. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 8% and livestock operational growth was 2%. Companion animal product growth resulted from increased sales of our Simparica franchise, including the launch of Simparica Trio in certain EU markets and growth in our key dermatology portfolio. New diagnostic customer accounts and strong performance in China also contributed to growth in the quarter, despite the impact of social distancing measures in China. International livestock growth in the quarter was driven primarily by swine, fish and poultry. Swine returned to growth in the quarter, due to expanding herd production and key account penetration across emerging markets including China. Our short-term outlook for China remains neutral to slightly positive as they rebuild due to lower incidents of African Swine Fever. However, certain smaller markets in Asia continue to experiences challenges related to ASF. The fish portfolio benefited from the continued uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile, while poultry growth was driven primarily by price. Overall, our International segment continued to be a positive contributor to revenue growth with all species flat to growing, including swine returning to growth even in the current challenging environment. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.3% increased slightly on a reported basis compared to the prior year, due to price partially offset by the mildly deluded impact of recent acquisitions. Total adjusted operating expenses grew 7% operationally. The increase was primarily related to the impact of recent acquisitions, investments to support future growth of the business and direct-to-consumer advertising. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.8%, the decrease from the comparable 2019 period is primarily driven by the tax benefits from share-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 10% operationally driven by revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally. Next I'd like to cover our liquidity position and our capital allocation priorities. We ended the first quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, as well as access to $1 billion revolving credit facility and a coinciding commercial paper program, both of which are undrawn. Given a strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Consistent with what I mentioned last quarter, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures this year to support investments in manufacturing, information technology to support our recent acquisitions and capabilities in digital and data analytics. However, we are delaying expenditures that will not materially impact our medium and long-term growth strategy. Our strong liquidity also allows us to be opportunistic and continue executing on our M&A strategy. In consistent with what I've said before, our focus is on strategic acquisitions, not large scale transformational M&A. Our recent acquisitions of Performance Livestock Analytics is a good example. With regards to returning excess cash to shareholders, we remain committed to our 2020 dividend, which represents a 22% increase over 2019. In Q1, we also repurchased $250 million in Zoetis shares and we have approximately $1.4 billion remaining under our multi-year share repurchase program. However, in light of the current situation, we have decided to temporarily suspend our share repurchases and conserve cash. Now moving on to our updated guidance assumptions for 2020. As I noted earlier, we cannot know the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation continues to evolve daily. Our updated guidance reflects our current assumptions and may change materially as the situation progresses. Our guidance assumes that the economy begins to open up in the second half of the year with pet care visits returning to more normalized levels as the year progresses and our livestock customers being able to maintain their operations. It also assumes a continued recession this year. We have increased the width of our ranges, as the timing of returning to normal operations and the depth of the recession is still uncertain. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April and movement in foreign exchange rate has had a significant impact on our revenue and adjusted net income, since prior guidance, given our global footprint. Our current guidance includes unstable foreign exchange revenue of approximately $150 million and approximately $50 million at adjusted net income, primarily driven by the Brazilian real, Mexican peso and the euro. We are now projecting revenue between $5.95 billion and $6.25 billion, representing a 2% operational decline to 3% operational growth. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is now expected to be in the range of 30.5% to 31.5%, increasing slightly from February guidance due to increased manufacturing and freight costs related to COVID-19. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are now expected to be between $1.455 billion and $1.545 billion with the decrease from the February guidance, driven by savings and compensation due to hiring freezes and reductions to discretionary spending, such as travel and entertainment and professional service spent. As Kristin indicated, our key R&D programs are progressing and so adjusted R&D expenses are now expected to be between $440 million and $465 million, consistent with our commitment to invest in pipeline opportunities. We're also continuing to invest in strategic areas of focus such as diagnostics, biodevices, and precision livestock farming and strategies to maximize the value of the continuum of care through integrated offerings. While we were taking measures to reduce expenses this year, we also remain committed to bring medium and long-term growth and value to our shareholders. Adjusted interest and other income deductions is now expected to be approximately $215 million with the increase over February guidance driven by lower interest income and other factors. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%, consistent with February guidance. Adjusted net income is expected to be in a range of $1.52 billion to $1.64 billion representing an operational decline of 2% to 9%. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.17 to $3.42 and reported diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.80 to $3.07. While our guidance represents full year expectations, we do anticipate revenue and adjusted net income to be most significantly impacted in Q2, based upon quarantine and shelter in place guidelines that have been put in place in most major markets around the world and the economic impact of recession. We anticipate the second half of the year will be impacted, but to a lesser extent. Now to summarize, before we move to Q&A. Pre COVID-19, 2020 was off to a strong start and inline with our expectations, with 7% operational revenue growth and 10% operational growth and adjusted net income. The essential nature of our business, the diversity of our portfolio and the durability of our business will allow us to continue executing on our strategy during this period of uncertainty. We're confident, we'll be able to maintain strong liquidity and manage effectively through this challenging environment, given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, and despite managing our spend in the short-term as we navigate through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to medium and long-term profitable growth through responsible investment. Now, I have things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator. Absolutely. Mike, to your question on the economic impacts of the recession, as we saw back in 2008, 2009, the animal health industry was essentially flat, showing strong resiliency. And then it had a pretty rapid bounce back in the next year growing around 7%. So in terms of the recessionary impacts, as Kristin said, the companion animal business, just due to a recession, we expect to be very resilient. We saw that back in 2008 and 2009, and the trends of pets becoming more part of the family has only continued even stronger there. In terms of the livestock area of the business, though, that's where the recession may have a larger impact. A, as people trade down to lower cost proteins, but also our livestock producers tend to go to cheaper products as their profitability is challenged, and we do provide premium products. So there will be some pricing challenges and just some overall challenges in the livestock industry more so than companion animal from a recession. Yes. In term of the updated guidance for Simparica Trio, we've now brought our estimate down from $150 million in incremental sales to $100 million to $125 million, and that's really based on launching in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of how we see the quarterly progression, we're not necessarily going to give quarterly forecast, but we did about $15 million in the quarter, and we do expect that to grow gradually over the year and to reflect more underlying demand throughout the year. To your question on the alternative channels, Erin, we are definitely seeing a ramp-up in alternative channels as a way for our customers to get their prescriptions filled. However, it's important to remember that, that is off of a relatively lower base still today. And also about 50% of our products do need to be administered within the clinic. So while we are seeing a rapid increase, it is off of a relatively small base. Yes, to Kristin's point, we did bake this into the guidance. Now when you look at our guidance, we do expect that Q2 will be more severely impacted. So the challenges that we're seeing now in livestock with the plant closures are baked in, and we do expect that Q2 will be more severely impacted for livestock and also for companion animal as well as this is when we see the clinic visit probably at their lowest in Q2. When we look toward the full year guidance range, the higher end of our ranges do assume that our producer customers are able to return to more normal operations throughout the second half of the year. Yes. So in terms of the total derm sales breakout. So for the year, total was \u2013 for the quarter, total was $194 million with 25% growth, U.S. was $136 million with 31% growth and international was $28 million with 14% growth. Yes. So John, when you look at the flow down to EPS, there are a couple of things that I want to point out. A, cost of goods is up since the last guidance, right, by about 50 basis points at the midpoint. Big part of that is driven by COVID-19 and some incremental freight costs. Those incremental costs, we expect to have to pay our suppliers for some of our key ingredients for the product. So that's one area that impacts the flow down to the bottom line. We did take cuts in SG&A about $100 million at the midpoint, as we've discussed. Well, we also do have additional interest expense. The previous guidance was $215 million. Current guidance is approximately $250 million, and that does take into account the fact that we will earn less interest income on our cash. And it also does contemplate that we may incur some additional debt throughout the year. So it's really the cost of goods and the interest expense that offsets some of the benefits that we were seeing in the other expense line that are impacting the EPS. Yes. So Chris, I'll just address your first question, and then we'll get into a little more of the details on the guidance. So in terms of COVID versus the recession, obviously, we think Q2 will be the most severely impacted, and COVID will be a big driver of that in both livestock and companion animal. In terms of then going forward, we do expect an impact from the recession, and we do expect that the recessionary impact will be more impactful on livestock than companion animal based on the reasons that Kristin just shared. However, I think when you look at the overall guidance, right, we did do a bottoms-up analysis to inform the guidance range because we do believe that the people in the markets are closest to this and have the best information. And what we got back was pretty clear that Q2 will be the hardest hit due to the impact of social distancing and the recession and the fact that the companion animal visits will be lowest in Q2, and livestock plant closures will also impact the livestock side of the business. When you look at the second half of the year, the high end of the guidance range assumes that the recessionary impacts continue, but that companion animal visits return to more normalized levels and that our livestock producers return to full operations. If you look at the lower end of the revenue range, that really assumes a very deep recession and also contemplates a potential second wave of the virus with social distancing measures negatively impacting both companion animal and livestock further in the second half of the year. So we're really just trying to be very transparent with investors as we always do, which is why we chose to provide the guidance with a broader range. However, as we look to the long-term future of both the industry and our business, we do expect that we will return to more normalized growth rates that we see in terms of revenue. Yes. So in terms of guidance and for Q2 in particular, in some of the trends that we're seeing in the more current weeks, I think it's important, a, to break it out between the U.S. and international. So again, reminding because of our international close, Q2 for us will be the month of March, April and May. So recovery in terms of visits, we'll have a smaller benefit in international because it only applies to the end of April and early May. When you look at the U.S. however, in early April we were seeing visits down 20% to 30%. But to your point, we have seen those numbers begin to rise pretty significantly. And to the extent that that continues, that could limit the impact that we would expect to see in Q2, particularly on the companion animal side of the business. So those are positive trends and we hope that those trends do continue. Yes. And in terms of the second wave, again, that's one of the assumptions within the lower end of our guidance range. We would anticipate that that would occur later in the year. Not necessarily in the coming months. Yes. So in terms of a companion animal in the international market, so we did see good growth of 8% in companion animal in the international markets. There were a couple of things that did factor into limiting that growth to some degree. So a, China grew 8%, which was actually a little below our expectations because of the impact of COVID-19 and the timing of COVID-19 within that market. We also did see declines in markets such as Italy and Canada. Italy was changed \u2013 was impacted by some changes in prescribing laws that we think again will recover it through the rest of the year. Whereas Canada was impacted somewhat by the timing of the launch of Simparica Trio, there was a hold on some of the sales for Simparica Trio from our customers in anticipation of Simparica Trio being provided shortly thereafter. Sure. So from Apoquel perspective and just from a broader companion animal perspective, we did not see stocking within the quarter. This is something that we monitor and manage very closely and we prefer ourselves to mirror our underlying demand. So we did not see significant stocking in the quarter of any extent. And when you look at the breakout between Apoquel and Cytopoint, they both perform very well in the quarter, but Cytopoint did actually grow more rapidly as we think the convenience and the compliance and the fact that it is administered in the clinic certainly does help Cytopoint. We also saw very rapid growth in Cytopoint in international, growing approximately 71% as it was introduced in new markets as well so very strong performance across the entire portfolio of both Cytopoint and Apoquel. Sure. So in terms of the relative margins across the livestock business, they actually are starting to converge across them. But in general, cattle is a higher margin, then comes swine and then comes poultry, but they're all relatively close. And then in terms of the revenue per visit. So, a, in the first quarter, we did see very positive trends in terms of revenue per visit in companion animal. We get most of that data honestly within the U.S. So we haven't seen anything telling us that revenue per visit is declining significantly, but that is something that we will track throughout the year, but we have no data that indicates that, that is a trend that should reverse at any time soon."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I\u2019ll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company\u2019s filings dated today, Tuesday, February 15, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and welcome everyone to our year end earnings call for 2021. I am happy to report that Zoetis delivered its strongest performance ever in 2021, thanks to our innovative, diverse and durable portfolio and the talent and commitment of our colleagues. We grew revenue 15% operationally, which is once again above the anticipated growth rate for the animal health market. And these results were highlighted by 27% operational growth in our companion animal portfolio with 1% operational growth in livestock. Our parasiticide dermatology vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibody therapies all contributed to these strong results driven by the positive trends in pet care, trends that we see continuing to be a key growth driver in 2022 and beyond. From a segment perspective, we saw solid balance across our global footprint with the U.S. up 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Operationally, for the year, China grew 25%, Brazil grew 28% and other emerging markets grew 22%, leading the way for our international performance. Another major growth driver for the year has been our global diagnostics portfolio, which grew 21% operationally with significant strength in international markets and the continued launch of VetScan Imagyst, our AI-driven diagnostics platform. Based on the strong revenue performance, we were able to deliver 19% operational growth in adjusted net income for the year, while investing significantly in our latest product launches as well as staffing, R&D and manufacturing projects for future growth. Looking ahead, we believe this momentum sets us up well for 2022. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in the coming year driven by continued strength in pet care, expansion of our diagnostics portfolio internationally as significant growth in both companion animal and livestock product sales for emerging markets, including China and Brazil. As a result, we are guiding to full year operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue. Wetteny and I will discuss more details about the full year 2022 guidance. But let me share some views on the year and other updates. First, the essential nature of animal health continues to be affirmed by our performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen the fundamental drivers such as increased emphasis on pet wellness, a growing global population and continuous consumption of animal-based proteins all reinforce the animal health industry as a positive investment choice. In terms of the companion animal market, people\u2019s commitment to the health and well-being of their pets has continued to drive higher spending and new opportunities for innovation, geographic expansion and increasing levels of care. Pet owners spending in animal health remains one of the more durable trends in consumer spending as people place a premium on the health and well-being of their pets, even during challenging economic times. In January, the Human Animal Bond Research Institute and Zoetis released the results of a new global survey of more than 16,000 pet owners and 1,200 small animal clinics, which reinforce how deep the connection is between pets and pet owners and how that dynamic relates to views on veterinary care and the related benefits of pet ownership. In the study, 92% of respondents said there was no reason they could ever be convinced to give up their pets and 86% said they would pay whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. The strength of the human animal bonds strongly correlated with higher rates of veterinary treatment for both preventative care and specific conditions in their pets. This study and other research support our focus on advancing an innovative pipeline for pain, dermatology and parasiticides for pets and we continue to invest in our field force, direct-to-consumer marketing and manufacturing capacity to bring these products to market. Moving on to the livestock industry, the need for safe and reliable sources of animal protein continues to be a fundamental growth driver for the industry, particularly in emerging markets. In any given year, weather, disease and market dynamics may have various regional impacts, but the underlying demand continues to be served locally or through global trade across more than 100 markets, where Zoetis products are sold. We have continued to see Zoetis\u2019 livestock business show modest growth during the pandemic and recent economic challenges based on our strength internationally. We see that international growth continuing this year, while we continue to see declines in the U.S. driven primarily by generic competition in certain product lines. Our competitive strategies in pricing and new lifecycle innovations will help us mitigate some of that impact. Livestock products are a key element of our global strategy and long-term growth and we have continued to expand our vaccine product lines like Poulvac Procerta for poultry and Alpha Ject Micro for fish as well as DRAXXIN KP as a treatment for cattle. We are also exploring more livestock innovations around greater efficiency, precision animal health and more sustainable food production. We have been focusing on our investments in vaccines for prevention and maintaining healthy animals, data analytics for more individualized animal care and research into other sustainability improvements around immunotherapies. I was particularly excited by two recently announced additions to our precision animal health portfolio, Performance Ranch, a new cloud-based cow-calf management software this simplified tracking of individual animal performance and health product usage and our new block yard platform, which is blockchain technology developed in cooperation with IBM to provide a secure way to share information across different segments of the animal production supply chain. For Zoetis, we continue to stay focused on our five strategic priorities for the long-term and we are optimistic about the growth drivers we see for 2022. Pet care will remain a major growth driver for Zoetis globally based on our diverse and innovative portfolio. We see continued growth potential for our dermatology portfolio, which surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2021. Our parasiticide driven by our triple combination, Simparica Trio as well as Revolution Plus, Stronghold Plus, Simparica and ProHeart 12 will continue to achieve growth as we gain market share in major markets and look at further lifecycle innovations and label gains across the portfolio. Librela and Solensia, our monoclonal antibodies for control of osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats will continue to increase their revenue in 2022, primarily in the EU and we are making regulatory progress for these products in the U.S. We received FDA approval for Solensia in January with the launch expected in the second half of the year and we still anticipate approval of Librela in the second half of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at a facility outside the U.S. As we begin 2022, we are seeing strong demand in the EU for Librela and Solensia and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. We continue to optimize our global supply chain and manage ongoing challenges, which have been creating isolated constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products. As always, maintaining a consistent reliable supply for our customers is our top priority and we have been communicating with them about any impacts to their orders. We want to ensure all pets can continue their treatments without interruption, especially for chronic treatment of OA pain. Our global manufacturing network is working around the clock to ensure reliable supply for our customers as they did throughout 2021 and our full year guidance and strong growth reflects our views on supply. Diagnostics is our next major growth driver in 2022 with a fully integrated point-of-care business that is prime for strong growth internationally, along with the expansion plans for relatively new reference lab operations. We are making significant progress in one of the fastest growing markets for animal health. We are adding more dedicated field force and customer service resources, while developing more offerings that will leverage our portfolio across the continuum of care. And finally, we see significant growth opportunities in emerging markets, including China and Brazil, where we see excellent opportunities for both our companion animal and livestock products based on increased medicalization and other positive trends. Meanwhile, our R&D team, along with external partners, will continue to generate the industry\u2019s most productive pipeline in the years to come, with more than $500 million in R&D spending in 2021 our largest ever annual investment for R&D. We continue progressing research to address allergies, livestock health, chronic pain and inflammation, chronic kidney disease and diagnostics through our vaccines, therapeutics and digital technology platforms. In conclusion, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another terrific year and for always bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers, everyday. Zoetis remains well-positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth to investors in 2022 and beyond. Now, let me hand things off to Wetteny.\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin and good morning everyone. 2021 was an exceptional year for us with revenue of $7.8 billion and adjusted net income of $2.2 billion both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 16% on a reported basis and 15% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 21% on a reported basis and 19% operationally. Looking deeper into the 2021 numbers, price contributed 1% to full year operational revenue growth, with volume contributing 14%. Volume growth consisted of 6% from other inline products, 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio and 3% from key dermatology products. Revenue growth was again broad-based with the U.S. growing 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Our strong performance was driven by our innovative, diverse and durable companion animal portfolio, which grew 27% operationally. Our livestock business, which faced generic competition on key franchises as well as challenging macro conditions in certain markets, grew 1% operationally on a year-over-year basis. Performance in companion animal was led by our small animal parasiticide portfolio bolstered by full year sales of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $425 million, an increase of $305 million compared to 2020 sales. Sales of Simparica also grew double-digits for the year, with operational revenue growth of 13%. For the year, the Simparica franchise grew 82% operationally, with revenue of approximately $0.75 billion. Our key dermatology products performed incredibly well, growing 24% operationally with approximately $1.2 billion in revenue for the year, performing above our expectations. Our diagnostics portfolio grew 21% operationally in the year, with strong contributions from our U.S. and international segments and we will continue to make meaningful investments in the coming years to drive global growth. We do believe the adoption of diagnostics products and services outside the U.S. represents larger growth opportunities geographically and feel we are favorably positioned to capture future growth in those markets. Our livestock performance in 2021 depicts the importance of geographical diversification. Generic competition and challenging market conditions weighed on our U.S. performance, but were offset by solid growth internationally, primarily in emerging markets. The modest livestock growth on a global basis was in line with our expectations for the year. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, we posted another strong quarter, with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 9% on both a reported and operational basis. Adjusted net income of $474 million is an increase of 8% on a reported basis and 5% operationally, of the 9% operational revenue growth, 1% from price and 8% from volume. Volume growth of 8% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio, 2% from key dermatology products and 1% from other inline products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of [indiscernible] growth, growing 21% operationally, with livestock 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Small animal parasiticides were the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, where our innovative and diverse fleet, tick and heartworm portfolio grew 32% operationally. Simparica Trio posted revenue of $124 million, representing operational growth of 106% versus the comparable 2020 period and the third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $100 million. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, again, had significant global growth in the quarter, with $360 million of revenue, representing 23% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 27% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our livestock business declined 6% in the quarter as a result of generic competition for DRAXXIN on favorable market conditions in the U.S., primarily resulting from elevated input costs as well as softer conditions in China, losses driven by reduced pork prices. Our fish business grew double-digits in the quarter and along with the strength of our emerging markets, partially offset the broader decline. Overall, livestock performance in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. Now, moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter, U.S. revenue grew 9%, with companion animal products growing 20% and livestock sales declining by 13%. U.S. pet care vet practice trends remained robust in Q4, with practice revenue growing approximately 8% with visits growing 3% despite challenging prior year comps. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales from our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We are driving growth in both therapeutic areas by making meaningful investments, primarily through direct-to-consumer advertising and field force and we continue to be pleased by the return on investment the programs are yielding. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter, with sales of $114 million growing more than 100%. We also met our clean penetration target and continued to take share within the clinics. Key dermatology sales were $216 million for the quarter, growing 22% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each growing significantly. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as the large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain untreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. U.S. livestock fell 13% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business, which as expected, was challenged by generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Our poultry business was negatively affected by reduced disease pressure from smaller flock sizes as well as generic competition, while swine faced competitive pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccine products. Moving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 8% on a reported and operational basis in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally and livestock revenue declined 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our key dermatology products, our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of OA pain and our parasiticide portfolio. Several key brands are benefiting from our international DTC campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. Overall, companion animal grew double-digits operationally in every major market in the quarter. We are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, with Librela generating $15 million and Solensia delivering $3 million in fourth quarter sales. In the fourth quarter, Librela became the number one pain product in the EU in its first year, with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates were in excess of 90% and compliance rates exceeded our initial expectations. In the past, we have highlighted the significant opportunity to expand the pain market. Therefore, we were extremely pleased to see approximately 40% of Librela and Solensia sales or from patients receiving medication for the first time. International livestock declined 2% operationally in the quarter as declines in cattle and swine were partially offset by growth in fish and poultry. Cattle declines were largely in the EU and Canada as generic competition for DRAXXIN weighed on sales. The decline in swine sales was primarily the result of lower pork prices in China negatively impacting producer profitability. Our fish portfolio grew double-digits again this quarter driven primarily by growth of Alpha Flux in Chile and the growth in poultry was largely attributed to further key account penetration. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, adjusted gross margin of 69.6% increased 190 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year resulted from favorable product mix, lower inventory charges, favorable FX and price. This was partially offset by higher freight, manufacturing and other costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with compensation-related costs being the primary driver of the 15% operational increase in SG&A as well as 3% operational increase in R&D expenses. Increased international advertising and promotion expense for key brands also contributed to higher SG&A, while R&D had increased project spend in the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%, an increase of 510 basis points, driven by the impact of prior year discrete tax benefits and changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 5% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 6% operationally for the quarter. In December, we announced a 30% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $200 million of Zoetis shares and announced the authorization of a $3.5 billion multiyear share repurchase program. Because we generate significant free cash flow, we have the ability to grow our business through organic investments and business development and return excess cash to shareholders without consuming our cash balance or being dependent on elevated leverage. Now moving on to guidance for 2022, please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact versus prior year by approximately $160 million on revenue, which is roughly 200 basis points and approximately $0.12 on EPS, which is about 250 basis points. For 2022, we are projecting revenue between $8.325 billion and $8.475 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse parasiticide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and the growth in point-of-care diagnostics and reference labs. We see a very favorable companion animal backdrop for 2022 while expecting certain vet clinics trends to moderate over time we believe they will remain above pre-pandemic levels. The catalyst for growth in 2022 and beyond stem from a younger pet owner demographic and the standard of care increases, which took shape over the prior 2 years. Our innovative portfolio, geographic representation and significant investments in key brands have us positioned extremely well to capture a meaningful portion of that growth. We anticipate modest livestock growth again in 2022 led by the contributions of our emerging markets. The macro trends which makes livestock and essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023. I\u2019d like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with companion animal, we do not assume a triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2022 to compete against Simparica Trio or competitive entrants for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. As Kristin mentioned, in 2022, we expect Librela to become a blockbuster product in the first full year of sales with revenue exceeding $100 million largely from the EU markets. We remain very optimistic about the potential of Solensia as well. While the revenue curve will have a different shape due to the lack of an established feline pain market, we review Solensia as a long-term blockbuster product, which suggested a significant unmet need in animal health. In livestock, we expect generic competition to negatively impact DRAXXIN revenue by approximately 20% in 2022 comparable to the impact we saw this year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29%, where favorable product mix and price are expected to generate margin expansion. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion with the increase from 2021 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including investments to support new and existing products as well as diagnostics. Adjusted R&D expense for 2022 is expected to be between $540 million and $560 million. Zoetis is the leader in animal health because of the novel products, disruptive innovation and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. Our internal R&D engine remains the primary source of innovation, and we are committed to ensuring it will continue to be significantly funded as a priority in capital allocation. Adjusted interest and other income inductions are expected to be approximately $240 million, representing a minimal year-over-year change. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2022 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2022 is primarily related to the favorable impact of foreign derived intangible income and nonrecurring net discrete tax benefits that occurred in 2021. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.470 billion, representing operational growth of 10% to 13%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We are anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures in 2022 primarily related to investments in manufacturing expansions in Ireland, the U.S. and China. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.19 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.87. While guidance represents our expectations for full year financials, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth in 2022. We expect top line growth to be fairly consistent between the first half and second half of the year. However, due to the impact of generic competition for DRAXXIN, isolated supply constraints and the continued weakness of our swine business in China, we expect growth in the first quarter of 2022 to be lower than the remaining three quarters. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support revenue growth, primarily in companion animal, including diagnostics, along with very challenging comparative periods for T&E and other expenses, will impact Q1 materially more than the subsequent quarters. Now to summarize, 2021 was another exceptional year, our best performing year with 15% operational revenue growth and 19% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our guidance for 2022 reflects the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and establish new markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in. Now I\u2019ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Congratulations on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. So you\u2019ve been very successful over the years in your R&D efforts. And where do you our next wave of innovation coming from? And is it going to be companion or livestock focused drugs or diagnostics? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Louise. Good to hear from you. We are quite excited with regards to our pipeline. And I really think it is the innovative nature of Zoetis that has made us so successful. As you look at the pipeline, we\u2019re excited about a number of areas, both across pet care and livestock. In pet care, continuing to innovate in the parasiticide space, it\u2019s a $5 billion market. I think we can continue to bring innovation there, certainly, growing our osteoarthritis monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela, Solensia continuing to innovate in the derm space. You saw us add Apoquel chewable in Europe, for example, there also leveraging that whole platform of monoclonal antibodies for other indications, we think is a big opportunity, really excited on diagnostics, the ability to continue to bring really disruptive innovation there. Certainly, our Imagyst platform and some of the new indications there is a great example. We also think taking a lot of our products and growing them in emerging markets will be valuable. And as you move into the livestock space, we\u2019re excited about vector vaccines and poultry, vaccines in cattle and in swine and then really investing as well in our precision livestock farming and genetics portfolio. You probably saw we launched two new products there over the last few weeks. So we think there is significant innovation across both pet care and livestock and believe we have strong platforms in R&D for growth, investing over $500 million in R&D.\nOperator: We will take the next question from Mike Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter and strong guide. Just to start, I know you touched on this in the prepared remarks, but I have to ask a follow-up on the Trio competition. We heard from one of your competitors that they may be closer than that. So even though you don\u2019t expect competition and it\u2019s not built into your assumptions for 2022, how would you react if you did see it? How would your assumptions be impacted? And how do you think you would adjust pricing or go-to-market? Sort of how would you see a flow through? And if I could ask just a quick follow-up to that, on pricing in general across the portfolio, what are your expectations for 2022? Are you going to be able to take more price, less price? Obviously, there is an inflationary environment. You have to think about livestock versus companion differently. So could you just talk us through your assumptions on price across the portfolio?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So let me take that first. With respect to Trio, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Trio and really the entire Simparica franchise. When you look at Trio, we delivered $124 million of revenue in the quarter. When you look across the franchise, we continue to see really strong growth. For the year, the franchise grew 82% across the board, so very pleased with that. And we\u2019re putting significant investments behind the product and across Simparica as well in markets where you don\u2019t see heartworm being prevalent. And so we\u2019ve seen Simparica grow 13% on the year. And so we continue to make those investments in our field force as well as advertising and DTC campaigns across \u2013 our confidence is that we will continue to see growth even when this competitor is in this space. We have seen that in other cases where other products have come into the market. When you look at the fleet tick heartworm market, it\u2019s the biggest market within animal health with $5 billion, and there are other products in the space that have better sizes of $800 million-plus. So as we look here, we continue to see more headroom to continue to grow this brand and this franchise even when there is competition. When I look at price, we delivered 1% of growth in price net in 2021. And we\u2019re probably looking at about the same sort of range when we think about 2022. You have to keep in mind while we see opportunities to take price across the board, particularly in companion animal and behind our innovative brands and seeing really strong demand in the end markets. We will continue to pull that lever. In terms of what\u2019s going the other way, as you\u2019re aware, DRAXXIN is one with competitive \u2013 generic competition there with respect to that as well as Zoamix in BMD, we\u2019ve seen that sort of partially offset, I would say, but we still delivered a net price increase in 2021 and we believe even as we look to offset inflation as we have done in 2021, we will have the opportunity to do that. We do look at price on a market-by-market and SKU-by-SKU basis. And so we deliberated about where we can be more aggressive, and we will take those opportunities as we go through.\nOperator: We will take the next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I had two on Librela. Kristin, I think you said you expect Librela to be a blockbuster in \u201822. What have you seen with respect prescribing patterns for vets that have started to use the product? I mean has this displaced other products? Or are vets just diagnosing OA more? And can \u2013 and does the guidance for it being a blockbuster in \u201822 assume a U.S. launch? And then just as a quick follow-up to that, could you just go into more detail on the supply disruption that you mentioned for Librela? Is it an API issue or a factory issue? Just any more details that you could share there, that would be great. Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Sure. Thanks, Nathan. We are very excited at the trends we\u2019re seeing in Librela in Europe. For starters, it is now the number one selling OA pain product in Europe, which is pretty incredible given it wasn\u2019t even a full year in Europe. And what\u2019s really exciting about that is we\u2019re seeing 40% of the prescriptions of pets that are new to the category. So I think for a lot of pet owners who are worried about safety or efficacy of the previous portfolios, they really see this as really a game changer. And the people who have been on it, we\u2019ve seen a 90% reorder rate from clinics and very high compliance. So once they are on it, really staying with it, which gives us great confidence as we look into 2022 that we can get Librela to be a blockbuster product. To your question about, does that assume a U.S. launch, it definitively does not assume a U.S. launch. We would not \u2013 with an approval late in the year, we would not be able to launch Librela in 2022. So that would hit blockbuster status just outside of the U.S. And as you look at some of the supply challenges, the inputs to Librela are the same inputs as you would make a human COVID vaccine. So we\u2019ve been really thoughtful about where we launch and making sure we do market by market, ensure we can supply. We have had challenges intermittently just having to do with the fact that the inputs are the same. So I think our supply chain team has done a phenomenal job. I mean, as a matter of fact, we\u2019re already the number one selling in OA pain, but we are really thoughtful about where we\u2019re launching. A lot of those are getting addressed. The capacity and a lot of those component parts in human health have increased. So we become more confident every quarter we can do that. But that is what was driving some of the short-term intermittent supply challenges we had in Europe. But I think if you look at our obvious guidance for this year, we can clearly see if we\u2019re going to hit $100 million that we\u2019re pretty confident we can address those.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. And I would just add with Librela in the fourth quarter, we were deliberate about holding back even new patients coming on. We just want to make sure that we can secure the inputs so that when it all comes on, they can stay on given that it\u2019s chronic OA pain conditions. So \u2013 and we\u2019ve been able to secure materials and be able to run, and we\u2019re confident in in our forecasted demand here to be able to manufacture and deliver those.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. A question on the monoclonal antibody, can you speak to the pipeline outside of Solensia? And you have significant capacity there and you\u2019ve entered multiple partnerships, including [indiscernible] products. How would you think about the targets there and the time line? And what\u2019s next on that front? Do you see several monoclonal antibody launches for you over the next 3 to 5 years? And then on diagnostics, you mentioned increased focus internationally. And can you speak to how that strategy is progressing, I guess, both in the U.S. and internationally for reference lab as well as on point of care. And is international reference lab also on your radar screen? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Erin. Yes, if you look at the monoclonal antibody platform, we do see this very much as a platform for growth with Librela and Solensia being the second and third. As you know, we also have a Cytopoint. We are the only one with any monoclonal antibodies approved right now. So I do think we have a good head start. We do see this similar to what you see in human health with application across a number of diseases. So we have not been terribly public about that pipeline. I think we\u2019ve talked about a few such as chronic kidney disease, etcetera. But obviously, in our world, our pipelines are not public, but we are very excited. We have invested in building significant capacity across monoclonal antibodies both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in multiple facilities just given our excitement on the fact that this is a really important space. We do have a number of partnerships with human health companies and even some small animal health companies in this space. So we\u2019re really excited at the pipeline and believe we can continue to launch new products, new mAbs over time. And I will let Wetteny take the diagnostic question.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, we continue to be very excited about the diagnostics space with growth above the animal health space in general. If you look at 2021, we delivered 21% growth in diagnostics across the year and particularly when you look at \u2013 although we grew both across U.S. and international. And we\u2019ve always said that international was the more level playing field where we look to be aggressive and we continue to make investments across field force, reference labs, etcetera, here. You\u2019ve seen us innovate in this space with Imagyst, the first AI platform with \u2013 indication. We look at additional indications coming on there as well. And so we will continue to make those investments, and diagnostics is one of our key growth drivers as we look ahead.\nOperator: We will go now to Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. It seems like you\u2019re implying 2022 companion animal growth, roughly mid to high teens, a very solid growth rate. Maybe I can just put you guys a little bit on some of the key products, any specifics for Trio when we think about 2022 or call the Simparica franchise and/or the atopic derm franchise just maybe in terms of contribution to growth? And then a little bit of a follow-up. Those Librela \u2013 certainly the Librela numbers are really solid international numbers, add the gate where the medicalization rates are usually a lot lower. So Kristin, can you just comment, does this still hold where, longer term, this is still like a 70-30 U.S. international split in terms of revenue from those novel therapeutics when we look out a number of years? Thanks, guys.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I will start with your second question on just Librela, Solensia and international. They are solid. Look, we are really focused on increasing the medicalization and the adoption of new technologies outside the U.S. I think it\u2019s been a key focus for Glenn David since he has moved into the international group. I mean as you know, there is a very similar number of animals in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And to your point, historically, the revenue splits have been quite different. But we are really looking at, especially in categories right now where we are the only product out there, derm is one, but even monoclonal OA pain, really thinking of unbranded, really seeing we can raise the standard of care, it\u2019s a key focus for us as well on the diagnostics space, how we increase medicalization outside the U.S. I think it will evolve over time. And I am not sure when it gets to the equal number of animals. But really why we feel we have a lot of optimism international, if you think about some of the emerging markets, where they are adopting new technologies, and that curve is quite different. So, if you look at the increase in China, Brazil, across a number of emerging markets, they are really moving up that curve much, much more quickly. And we also see our belief that we can continue to do that in some of the key categories. And to your point and your first question, we continue to see growth potential in derm. We do not expect a competitor in 2022 in derm. Again, I don\u2019t have any data, but you always ask me, why do I leave that, I mean based on just what I know today, we could obviously be wrong. So, we are going to invest aggressively as we have been doing in direct-to-consumer. We still believe there are 6 million untreated dogs in the U.S. alone who have itch and don\u2019t have treatment. And if you saw the growth that we delivered in 2021 across derm, it\u2019s 24% growth and already at over $1 billion, we still see growth in derm. Certainly in paras, we are going to aggressively grow that portfolio through direct-to-consumer advertising amongst other things in 2022 to make sure we have the highest share as we enter. I think the brand equity there has been really strong. So, we continue to see significant opportunities as well in paras. So \u2013 and I think you also can add in emerging markets across all these continuing to do really well. So, as we look at growth, obviously, growth will be led, as you referenced by our companion animal business in 2022. And I think what\u2019s important is there is not one key platform that\u2019s driving that. It is multiple. It is derm, it is paras, it is diagnostics, it\u2019s mAbs, it\u2019s emerging markets. So, we do think we have a range of platforms to continue to grow in 2022 and beyond.\nOperator: We will go now to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just a follow-up on Librela and capacity in the U.S. launch. I guess by the time that drug is approved later this year, do you expect some of these issues will be addressed by then, or should we be thinking about either a gap between approval and rollout or a more targeted rollout as you are dealing with capacity? I am just trying to get a sense of is this something that\u2019s the next few quarters that you are going to be addressing most of this, or is this going to be an ongoing kind of challenge given the kind of broader capacity demands in the industry out there? And then the second question, I was \u2013 just maybe a longer term operating margin question. And the guidance implies moderating \u2013 moderate kind of operating margin improvements in \u201822. As I think about longer term, do you see kind of a sustained period where we are going to see OpEx growth that\u2019s kind of keeping up with overall sales growth so that you are seeing some margin improvement but not a ton, or do we think about a window where there is maybe a larger margin improvement cycle coming as we maybe think out to 2023 and beyond as maybe some of these initial investments on derm, Trio, etcetera, kind of start to plateau at some point in here? Thanks so much.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Let me take both. So, going to your first question with respect to Librela, as we said in the prepared commentary, we continue to anticipate approval sometime late in 2022, that is hedging on an inspection that the FDA has to do at a facility outside the U.S. By the time this product gets approved and as we continue to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and our plans, we anticipate having the manufacturing capacity that we need to meet demand across the market. Now, we will certainly leverage our learnings from our launches outside the U.S. in terms of how we go about executing that with respect to early experience programs, etcetera. But at this point, we are confident in our ability to manufacture to meet customer commitments across that product when it gets approved. Now, going on to operating margins, as we have said, we see opportunity to really invest behind a number of areas to drive long-term sustainable growth. And we are doing so, whether you look at R&D, investments in our field force, for example, investments in advertising campaigns, DTC campaigns behind our brands that we can really drive growth in \u2013 particularly in areas where we have an advantage like being the only triple combination in the U.S. as we speak as well as in the derm area. As we do that, we will be aggressive, but we are mindful to grow the bottom line faster than the top line. And that may narrow the range that you see from time-to-time. But certainly, the business has the ability to continue to expand margins, and we have demonstrated that. But we are going to be aggressive about those opportunities when we see them, which may narrow that range. In terms of how long do we continue to see that, as long as we see the opportunity to continue to drive growth and grab more share, we will execute on those, but be mindful of that value proposition.\nOperator: We will go now to Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Firstly, on the R&D pipeline, the innovations that you called out and the focus that you called out six, seven areas for innovation, I am not sure if I am reading too much into it, but I thought oncology pipeline was the same. I remember this being flagged as an important carrier in the past. Have you had a change of thought around oncology as a key area of innovation? And just on Librela, does your success in the first year drive you to revisit your thoughts around the longer term opportunity in the clinic pain market? You have called it out as a market which can potentially double over the next few years. Is there an upside risk to those numbers? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. As we talk about the pipeline, certainly oncology is in there. We don\u2019t get very specific with regards to that. I don\u2019t believe we have ever said anything specific with regards to oncology historically. It\u2019s certainly an area we are looking at, but I would say some of the other focus areas we talked about, we used to think in the near-term will likely drive more value. As you look at Librela, as the outlook changed. I mean we think that taking a $400 million market that\u2019s been established for a long time in doubling it is pretty aggressive. We are \u2013 we probably have more conviction in our ability to do that is what I would say just based on the first two full quarters that we have launched the product outside the U.S. So more confidence there and more confidence as well that we can take what is almost like a nonexistent market in the cat for Solensia and make that a $200 million. So, I am not sure we are willing to say above that. I think doubling a market as a pretty aggressive timeline \u2013 pretty aggressive there. But I do think our commitment and our conviction and our ability to do that and do it faster, certainly, I would say, is strong.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Rains with William Blair. Your line is open.\nChristine Rains: Hi, congratulations and good morning. I am just hoping to have some more color about the Solensia rollout in Europe and how that can translate into the U.S. So, just kind of how are you reaching cat owners given the low medicalization of cats and the fact that cat owners don\u2019t really bring their cats into the vet very often? And also, is this a vet-administered product or something pet owners can do at home via injection? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. The one thing we have done with Solensia was the learning from Cytopoint. Certainly, as you bring new technologies and create new markets, it starts with really with your KOLs. So our plan, as you probably saw in 2021, which was first start with early experience with some of the key opinion leaders in each of the markets to get them experience, to get them talking for general practitioners to be able to call them and sort of hear their experiences seeing videos. As you think about, you made a really good point you have seen with regards to pet owners. We are also trying to provide tools for pet owners to be able to know when their cat is in pain. Cats do a great job of hiding it. So, that\u2019s really been a focus on videos to show them what it looks like, so they can sort of notice it, giving a big awareness campaign there and then helping vets understand how to make it easier for people to either bring their cats in or there is some now cat-only clinics or the ability to have vets go out and do injections or have technicians go out and do injections. We are not focused right now on having monoclonal antibodies being able to be done by consumers at their house. This is a pretty advanced technology. Our focus is really on helping to raise awareness, increase the medicalization and make treating these cats easier either at the clinic or at home. There is really no reason, for example, technician, once the vet that has seen it can\u2019t do the monthly injection at home. So, we are just seeing really positive, but it takes a thoughtful creation of the market. And as I talked about before, that would be our plan in the U.S. as well. We will start with early experience, get that \u2013 get the KOLs talking, get things of able to be seeing multiple cats. And that really helps us, once you get in the GPs, ensure that they are using it and they know how to do it successfully. So, that is our plan as we think about it.\nOperator: We will take the next question from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nElliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. I guess just two questions for Kristin, specifically with respect to your outlook for the livestock segment in aggregate, anything you could say about growth expectations for the specific species and what \u2013 which of those may have more risk based on your current assumption than others? And then just switching gears to the international markets and specifically thinking about regions where you showed 20% plus or stronger growth, Chile, Italy, China, etcetera, can you just talk maybe a little bit more about the key drivers there? How much of the growth is coming from companion versus livestock? Which markets is the company over-performing? And what are the key drivers of that over-performance? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Elliot. I will take the first, and I will let Wetteny take your second one on some of the specific international markets. As we talk about livestock, first of all, it has been hit much harder with COVID than the pet care space. Pet care has actually been a beneficiary of COVID. And it\u2019s, by its nature, a cyclical industry. So, it can go up and go down. Ultimately, we believe as you look at sort of once we get past the DRAXXIN and some of the other big product LOEs, it will go back to mid-single digit growth. But if you double-click that a little way, obviously, the biggest challenge for us specifically has been cattle, and that\u2019s really been led by DRAXXIN, which overall last year declined by 15%, which was in line with our expectations. We expect in 2022 to have a 20% decline as we had a full year with generic competition there. But there is a lot of bright spots as you look at different species to your point. You look at fish, they grew 23% in 2021. We see that as a fast-growing species with really positive fundamentals. We think poultry, which grew last year 6%, maybe a little bit more challenged, obviously, in the U.S. with some of the generic competition there. But we are really excited about some of the innovative things that we are launching there. We saw swine last year at 4%. So, livestock is not one, as you know, and it obviously varies by market. And I think it\u2019s important to sort of note as you look at international, it was growing in livestock significantly last year. So, if you really pull out the DRAXXIN effect. As we look at livestock, we do believe it will go back to, for us and for the industry, mid-single digits. For us, we have just got to get out of some of these near-term LOEs. We are also excited about our pipeline there, which we think, again, can drive incremental growth above the market as we launch innovation into that sector. So, I don\u2019t know, Wetteny, you want to take some of the specifics on the international markets, emerging markets, Brazil, China.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, absolutely. Look, one of the most remarkable things, at least in my first year here, that I have come to realize is what we are seeing in terms of trends on companion animal not just in the U.S., but we are seeing them across the emerging markets. Now if you step back, international is still about just over 50% of our international revenues, our livestock and companion animal is about just over 40%. However, the pace of growth that we are seeing across markets, I am comparing absolutely phenomenal. Markets like China that used to be mostly livestock is now about 50% companion animal. And elsewhere, even when we talk about Brazil, we are seeing a really great year across cattle, etcetera. Brazil is growing double digits in companion animal. So, we believe those trends \u2013 those same reasons that are driving growth for companion animal, where pet owners prioritize the health of their pets and are willing to spend more on them, we are seeing those across international markets and we see those outpacing growth versus livestock, although we have seen livestock growth in international markets, as Kristin mentioned. It was 8% growth in livestock in 2021 across our international markets. And if you look at species, fish, for example, is 100% of our fish business is outside the U.S. So, that\u2019s one area of growth that we anticipate as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color looking across international.\nOperator: The next question comes from Navann Ty with Citi. Your line is open.\nNavann Ty: Hi, good morning. Could you discuss your expectation on vet staffing in the near-term and the potential impact on Zoetis Companion Animal segment, if any? And then I have a second question on Simparica Trio. Can you give us more details on the label expansion, how significant could be the new indications? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Thanks so much. I will start with the vet staffing. They are sort of short-term and long-term. We did see something challenges in the U.S. in December and January, given absenteeism with COVID, and that was sort of short-term. So, as you look at trends overall in the U.S., we continue to see those to be strong with 8% revenue growth led by a 3% increase in traffic and spend per visit at 5%. Double clicking on that traffic 3%, we think, again, it will get back to sort of what are our more normal trends. There has been a challenge, as you mentioned, given there are so many more pets being seen, making sure that the staffing levels at both the vets and the technicians side remain strong. We are really focused on partnering with both the ADMA and the ADMC in the U.S. and honestly, around the globe to ensure there is a reliable supply of vets and vet technicians. But importantly as well, to make sure that the veterinary profession and vet clinics remain really attractive jobs, and so it\u2019s really partnering with different organizations to make sure that, that is the case. I would say everyone is aligned here. I think you are seeing significant increases in compensation for many of these vets. We firmly believe that they are doing the right things to make sure that they can provide the great customer care and pet care that they need to. But obviously, it\u2019s something that we are highly invested in partnering across the industry to make sure that pets get the care that they need and the staffing levels remain high. It is a challenge given the very quick growth in the number of pets that were adopted over the last 2 years. So, the challenge is there, but we are really confident that in partnership with many other companies, pharmaceutical companies as well as vet clinics and associations, we can ensure that the vets and the vet technicians can meet that need. Do you want to \u2013 there is a question on Trio label extensions in the future. I don\u2019t think we have been specific about what we are looking at there and we wouldn\u2019t just for competitive reasons.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kathy Miner with Cowen. Your line is open.\nKathy Miner: Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions. First on Solensia and the U.S. launch, can you just clarify that the launch in the second half of this year is just a setup for getting education and preparation as opposed to any supply issues? And will you be coordinating the marketing with Librela in the U.S. once it gets approved? Second question, just to follow-up on the derm side of it, for 2022, I don\u2019t think you said a growth target, but clearly, you have got to be pretty optimistic with no competition coming in for this year. Do you think that you could see growth get \u2013 matching the 2021 trends? And do your assumptions for the derm include a U.S. chewable or any feline options? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. So, with regards to Solensia, yes, we are focused when we think about the long-term to ensure that we start with early experience. We build that market, and we will obviously launch shortly thereafter. But we are not concerned there on a supply issue. The plans that we have assume supply for exactly what we are planning on doing. So, that is not what\u2019s driving that one. And derm in 2022, we continue to expect robust growth obviously with \u2013 right now, as we talked about, we are not expecting competition next year, of course, we could be wrong, but we are not. And therefore, we will invest aggressively, not just in the U.S., but outside the U.S. That does not, to your question, assume that we have Apoquel chewable in the U.S. and nor does that number that we are talking about in derm assume that we are having it for cat. So, we really believe with Apoquel, Cytopoint, Apoquel chewable outside the U.S., we can continue to drive robust growth in 2022 across the category.\nOperator: This will conclude our Q&A session. It is now my pleasure to hand the program back to Kristin Peck for any additional or closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Great. Look, thank you, everyone, for your questions and your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, I am really proud of what Zoetis delivered in 2021, having our best year ever. And we see that positive momentum really continuing into 2022, as I think you heard today from both Wetteny and myself, we will continue to build on our diverse global portfolio and really our strength in pet care, diagnostics and emerging markets to grow faster than the market in 2022 and beyond. And we are committed to the investments in talent, technology, manufacturing and innovation that will spur our future growth. So, thanks so much, everybody, and talk to you soon.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Steve and welcome everyone to our year end earnings call for 2021. I am happy to report that Zoetis delivered its strongest performance ever in 2021, thanks to our innovative, diverse and durable portfolio and the talent and commitment of our colleagues. We grew revenue 15% operationally, which is once again above the anticipated growth rate for the animal health market. And these results were highlighted by 27% operational growth in our companion animal portfolio with 1% operational growth in livestock. Our parasiticide dermatology vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibody therapies all contributed to these strong results driven by the positive trends in pet care, trends that we see continuing to be a key growth driver in 2022 and beyond. From a segment perspective, we saw solid balance across our global footprint with the U.S. up 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Operationally, for the year, China grew 25%, Brazil grew 28% and other emerging markets grew 22%, leading the way for our international performance. Another major growth driver for the year has been our global diagnostics portfolio, which grew 21% operationally with significant strength in international markets and the continued launch of VetScan Imagyst, our AI-driven diagnostics platform. Based on the strong revenue performance, we were able to deliver 19% operational growth in adjusted net income for the year, while investing significantly in our latest product launches as well as staffing, R&D and manufacturing projects for future growth. Looking ahead, we believe this momentum sets us up well for 2022. We expect to continue growing revenue faster than the market in the coming year driven by continued strength in pet care, expansion of our diagnostics portfolio internationally as significant growth in both companion animal and livestock product sales for emerging markets, including China and Brazil. As a result, we are guiding to full year operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue. Wetteny and I will discuss more details about the full year 2022 guidance. But let me share some views on the year and other updates. First, the essential nature of animal health continues to be affirmed by our performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen the fundamental drivers such as increased emphasis on pet wellness, a growing global population and continuous consumption of animal-based proteins all reinforce the animal health industry as a positive investment choice. In terms of the companion animal market, people's commitment to the health and well-being of their pets has continued to drive higher spending and new opportunities for innovation, geographic expansion and increasing levels of care. Pet owners spending in animal health remains one of the more durable trends in consumer spending as people place a premium on the health and well-being of their pets, even during challenging economic times. In January, the Human Animal Bond Research Institute and Zoetis released the results of a new global survey of more than 16,000 pet owners and 1,200 small animal clinics, which reinforce how deep the connection is between pets and pet owners and how that dynamic relates to views on veterinary care and the related benefits of pet ownership. In the study, 92% of respondents said there was no reason they could ever be convinced to give up their pets and 86% said they would pay whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. The strength of the human animal bonds strongly correlated with higher rates of veterinary treatment for both preventative care and specific conditions in their pets. This study and other research support our focus on advancing an innovative pipeline for pain, dermatology and parasiticides for pets and we continue to invest in our field force, direct-to-consumer marketing and manufacturing capacity to bring these products to market. Moving on to the livestock industry, the need for safe and reliable sources of animal protein continues to be a fundamental growth driver for the industry, particularly in emerging markets. In any given year, weather, disease and market dynamics may have various regional impacts, but the underlying demand continues to be served locally or through global trade across more than 100 markets, where Zoetis products are sold. We have continued to see Zoetis' livestock business show modest growth during the pandemic and recent economic challenges based on our strength internationally. We see that international growth continuing this year, while we continue to see declines in the U.S. driven primarily by generic competition in certain product lines. Our competitive strategies in pricing and new lifecycle innovations will help us mitigate some of that impact. Livestock products are a key element of our global strategy and long-term growth and we have continued to expand our vaccine product lines like Poulvac Procerta for poultry and Alpha Ject Micro for fish as well as DRAXXIN KP as a treatment for cattle. We are also exploring more livestock innovations around greater efficiency, precision animal health and more sustainable food production. We have been focusing on our investments in vaccines for prevention and maintaining healthy animals, data analytics for more individualized animal care and research into other sustainability improvements around immunotherapies. I was particularly excited by two recently announced additions to our precision animal health portfolio, Performance Ranch, a new cloud-based cow-calf management software this simplified tracking of individual animal performance and health product usage and our new block yard platform, which is blockchain technology developed in cooperation with IBM to provide a secure way to share information across different segments of the animal production supply chain. For Zoetis, we continue to stay focused on our five strategic priorities for the long-term and we are optimistic about the growth drivers we see for 2022. Pet care will remain a major growth driver for Zoetis globally based on our diverse and innovative portfolio. We see continued growth potential for our dermatology portfolio, which surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the first time in 2021. Our parasiticide driven by our triple combination, Simparica Trio as well as Revolution Plus, Stronghold Plus, Simparica and ProHeart 12 will continue to achieve growth as we gain market share in major markets and look at further lifecycle innovations and label gains across the portfolio. Librela and Solensia, our monoclonal antibodies for control of osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats will continue to increase their revenue in 2022, primarily in the EU and we are making regulatory progress for these products in the U.S. We received FDA approval for Solensia in January with the launch expected in the second half of the year and we still anticipate approval of Librela in the second half of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at a facility outside the U.S. As we begin 2022, we are seeing strong demand in the EU for Librela and Solensia and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. We continue to optimize our global supply chain and manage ongoing challenges, which have been creating isolated constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products. As always, maintaining a consistent reliable supply for our customers is our top priority and we have been communicating with them about any impacts to their orders. We want to ensure all pets can continue their treatments without interruption, especially for chronic treatment of OA pain. Our global manufacturing network is working around the clock to ensure reliable supply for our customers as they did throughout 2021 and our full year guidance and strong growth reflects our views on supply. Diagnostics is our next major growth driver in 2022 with a fully integrated point-of-care business that is prime for strong growth internationally, along with the expansion plans for relatively new reference lab operations. We are making significant progress in one of the fastest growing markets for animal health. We are adding more dedicated field force and customer service resources, while developing more offerings that will leverage our portfolio across the continuum of care. And finally, we see significant growth opportunities in emerging markets, including China and Brazil, where we see excellent opportunities for both our companion animal and livestock products based on increased medicalization and other positive trends. Meanwhile, our R&D team, along with external partners, will continue to generate the industry's most productive pipeline in the years to come, with more than $500 million in R&D spending in 2021 our largest ever annual investment for R&D. We continue progressing research to address allergies, livestock health, chronic pain and inflammation, chronic kidney disease and diagnostics through our vaccines, therapeutics and digital technology platforms. In conclusion, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another terrific year and for always bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers, everyday. Zoetis remains well-positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth to investors in 2022 and beyond. Now, let me hand things off to Wetteny. Thanks, Louise. Good to hear from you. We are quite excited with regards to our pipeline. And I really think it is the innovative nature of Zoetis that has made us so successful. As you look at the pipeline, we're excited about a number of areas, both across pet care and livestock. In pet care, continuing to innovate in the parasiticide space, it's a $5 billion market. I think we can continue to bring innovation there, certainly, growing our osteoarthritis monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela, Solensia continuing to innovate in the derm space. You saw us add Apoquel chewable in Europe, for example, there also leveraging that whole platform of monoclonal antibodies for other indications, we think is a big opportunity, really excited on diagnostics, the ability to continue to bring really disruptive innovation there. Certainly, our Imagyst platform and some of the new indications there is a great example. We also think taking a lot of our products and growing them in emerging markets will be valuable. And as you move into the livestock space, we're excited about vector vaccines and poultry, vaccines in cattle and in swine and then really investing as well in our precision livestock farming and genetics portfolio. You probably saw we launched two new products there over the last few weeks. So we think there is significant innovation across both pet care and livestock and believe we have strong platforms in R&D for growth, investing over $500 million in R&D. Sure. Sure. Thanks, Nathan. We are very excited at the trends we're seeing in Librela in Europe. For starters, it is now the number one selling OA pain product in Europe, which is pretty incredible given it wasn't even a full year in Europe. And what's really exciting about that is we're seeing 40% of the prescriptions of pets that are new to the category. So I think for a lot of pet owners who are worried about safety or efficacy of the previous portfolios, they really see this as really a game changer. And the people who have been on it, we've seen a 90% reorder rate from clinics and very high compliance. So once they are on it, really staying with it, which gives us great confidence as we look into 2022 that we can get Librela to be a blockbuster product. To your question about, does that assume a U.S. launch, it definitively does not assume a U.S. launch. We would not \u2013 with an approval late in the year, we would not be able to launch Librela in 2022. So that would hit blockbuster status just outside of the U.S. And as you look at some of the supply challenges, the inputs to Librela are the same inputs as you would make a human COVID vaccine. So we've been really thoughtful about where we launch and making sure we do market by market, ensure we can supply. We have had challenges intermittently just having to do with the fact that the inputs are the same. So I think our supply chain team has done a phenomenal job. I mean, as a matter of fact, we're already the number one selling in OA pain, but we are really thoughtful about where we're launching. A lot of those are getting addressed. The capacity and a lot of those component parts in human health have increased. So we become more confident every quarter we can do that. But that is what was driving some of the short-term intermittent supply challenges we had in Europe. But I think if you look at our obvious guidance for this year, we can clearly see if we're going to hit $100 million that we're pretty confident we can address those. Thanks, Erin. Yes, if you look at the monoclonal antibody platform, we do see this very much as a platform for growth with Librela and Solensia being the second and third. As you know, we also have a Cytopoint. We are the only one with any monoclonal antibodies approved right now. So I do think we have a good head start. We do see this similar to what you see in human health with application across a number of diseases. So we have not been terribly public about that pipeline. I think we've talked about a few such as chronic kidney disease, etcetera. But obviously, in our world, our pipelines are not public, but we are very excited. We have invested in building significant capacity across monoclonal antibodies both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in multiple facilities just given our excitement on the fact that this is a really important space. We do have a number of partnerships with human health companies and even some small animal health companies in this space. So we're really excited at the pipeline and believe we can continue to launch new products, new mAbs over time. And I will let Wetteny take the diagnostic question. Sure. I will start with your second question on just Librela, Solensia and international. They are solid. Look, we are really focused on increasing the medicalization and the adoption of new technologies outside the U.S. I think it's been a key focus for Glenn David since he has moved into the international group. I mean as you know, there is a very similar number of animals in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And to your point, historically, the revenue splits have been quite different. But we are really looking at, especially in categories right now where we are the only product out there, derm is one, but even monoclonal OA pain, really thinking of unbranded, really seeing we can raise the standard of care, it's a key focus for us as well on the diagnostics space, how we increase medicalization outside the U.S. I think it will evolve over time. And I am not sure when it gets to the equal number of animals. But really why we feel we have a lot of optimism international, if you think about some of the emerging markets, where they are adopting new technologies, and that curve is quite different. So, if you look at the increase in China, Brazil, across a number of emerging markets, they are really moving up that curve much, much more quickly. And we also see our belief that we can continue to do that in some of the key categories. And to your point and your first question, we continue to see growth potential in derm. We do not expect a competitor in 2022 in derm. Again, I don't have any data, but you always ask me, why do I leave that, I mean based on just what I know today, we could obviously be wrong. So, we are going to invest aggressively as we have been doing in direct-to-consumer. We still believe there are 6 million untreated dogs in the U.S. alone who have itch and don't have treatment. And if you saw the growth that we delivered in 2021 across derm, it's 24% growth and already at over $1 billion, we still see growth in derm. Certainly in paras, we are going to aggressively grow that portfolio through direct-to-consumer advertising amongst other things in 2022 to make sure we have the highest share as we enter. I think the brand equity there has been really strong. So, we continue to see significant opportunities as well in paras. So \u2013 and I think you also can add in emerging markets across all these continuing to do really well. So, as we look at growth, obviously, growth will be led, as you referenced by our companion animal business in 2022. And I think what's important is there is not one key platform that's driving that. It is multiple. It is derm, it is paras, it is diagnostics, it's mAbs, it's emerging markets. So, we do think we have a range of platforms to continue to grow in 2022 and beyond. Sure. As we talk about the pipeline, certainly oncology is in there. We don't get very specific with regards to that. I don't believe we have ever said anything specific with regards to oncology historically. It's certainly an area we are looking at, but I would say some of the other focus areas we talked about, we used to think in the near-term will likely drive more value. As you look at Librela, as the outlook changed. I mean we think that taking a $400 million market that's been established for a long time in doubling it is pretty aggressive. We are \u2013 we probably have more conviction in our ability to do that is what I would say just based on the first two full quarters that we have launched the product outside the U.S. So more confidence there and more confidence as well that we can take what is almost like a nonexistent market in the cat for Solensia and make that a $200 million. So, I am not sure we are willing to say above that. I think doubling a market as a pretty aggressive timeline \u2013 pretty aggressive there. But I do think our commitment and our conviction and our ability to do that and do it faster, certainly, I would say, is strong. Sure. The one thing we have done with Solensia was the learning from Cytopoint. Certainly, as you bring new technologies and create new markets, it starts with really with your KOLs. So our plan, as you probably saw in 2021, which was first start with early experience with some of the key opinion leaders in each of the markets to get them experience, to get them talking for general practitioners to be able to call them and sort of hear their experiences seeing videos. As you think about, you made a really good point you have seen with regards to pet owners. We are also trying to provide tools for pet owners to be able to know when their cat is in pain. Cats do a great job of hiding it. So, that's really been a focus on videos to show them what it looks like, so they can sort of notice it, giving a big awareness campaign there and then helping vets understand how to make it easier for people to either bring their cats in or there is some now cat-only clinics or the ability to have vets go out and do injections or have technicians go out and do injections. We are not focused right now on having monoclonal antibodies being able to be done by consumers at their house. This is a pretty advanced technology. Our focus is really on helping to raise awareness, increase the medicalization and make treating these cats easier either at the clinic or at home. There is really no reason, for example, technician, once the vet that has seen it can't do the monthly injection at home. So, we are just seeing really positive, but it takes a thoughtful creation of the market. And as I talked about before, that would be our plan in the U.S. as well. We will start with early experience, get that \u2013 get the KOLs talking, get things of able to be seeing multiple cats. And that really helps us, once you get in the GPs, ensure that they are using it and they know how to do it successfully. So, that is our plan as we think about it. Sure. Thanks, Elliot. I will take the first, and I will let Wetteny take your second one on some of the specific international markets. As we talk about livestock, first of all, it has been hit much harder with COVID than the pet care space. Pet care has actually been a beneficiary of COVID. And it's, by its nature, a cyclical industry. So, it can go up and go down. Ultimately, we believe as you look at sort of once we get past the DRAXXIN and some of the other big product LOEs, it will go back to mid-single digit growth. But if you double-click that a little way, obviously, the biggest challenge for us specifically has been cattle, and that's really been led by DRAXXIN, which overall last year declined by 15%, which was in line with our expectations. We expect in 2022 to have a 20% decline as we had a full year with generic competition there. But there is a lot of bright spots as you look at different species to your point. You look at fish, they grew 23% in 2021. We see that as a fast-growing species with really positive fundamentals. We think poultry, which grew last year 6%, maybe a little bit more challenged, obviously, in the U.S. with some of the generic competition there. But we are really excited about some of the innovative things that we are launching there. We saw swine last year at 4%. So, livestock is not one, as you know, and it obviously varies by market. And I think it's important to sort of note as you look at international, it was growing in livestock significantly last year. So, if you really pull out the DRAXXIN effect. As we look at livestock, we do believe it will go back to, for us and for the industry, mid-single digits. For us, we have just got to get out of some of these near-term LOEs. We are also excited about our pipeline there, which we think, again, can drive incremental growth above the market as we launch innovation into that sector. So, I don't know, Wetteny, you want to take some of the specifics on the international markets, emerging markets, Brazil, China. Thanks so much. I will start with the vet staffing. They are sort of short-term and long-term. We did see something challenges in the U.S. in December and January, given absenteeism with COVID, and that was sort of short-term. So, as you look at trends overall in the U.S., we continue to see those to be strong with 8% revenue growth led by a 3% increase in traffic and spend per visit at 5%. Double clicking on that traffic 3%, we think, again, it will get back to sort of what are our more normal trends. There has been a challenge, as you mentioned, given there are so many more pets being seen, making sure that the staffing levels at both the vets and the technicians side remain strong. We are really focused on partnering with both the ADMA and the ADMC in the U.S. and honestly, around the globe to ensure there is a reliable supply of vets and vet technicians. But importantly as well, to make sure that the veterinary profession and vet clinics remain really attractive jobs, and so it's really partnering with different organizations to make sure that, that is the case. I would say everyone is aligned here. I think you are seeing significant increases in compensation for many of these vets. We firmly believe that they are doing the right things to make sure that they can provide the great customer care and pet care that they need to. But obviously, it's something that we are highly invested in partnering across the industry to make sure that pets get the care that they need and the staffing levels remain high. It is a challenge given the very quick growth in the number of pets that were adopted over the last 2 years. So, the challenge is there, but we are really confident that in partnership with many other companies, pharmaceutical companies as well as vet clinics and associations, we can ensure that the vets and the vet technicians can meet that need. Do you want to \u2013 there is a question on Trio label extensions in the future. I don't think we have been specific about what we are looking at there and we wouldn't just for competitive reasons. Sure. So, with regards to Solensia, yes, we are focused when we think about the long-term to ensure that we start with early experience. We build that market, and we will obviously launch shortly thereafter. But we are not concerned there on a supply issue. The plans that we have assume supply for exactly what we are planning on doing. So, that is not what's driving that one. And derm in 2022, we continue to expect robust growth obviously with \u2013 right now, as we talked about, we are not expecting competition next year, of course, we could be wrong, but we are not. And therefore, we will invest aggressively, not just in the U.S., but outside the U.S. That does not, to your question, assume that we have Apoquel chewable in the U.S. and nor does that number that we are talking about in derm assume that we are having it for cat. So, we really believe with Apoquel, Cytopoint, Apoquel chewable outside the U.S., we can continue to drive robust growth in 2022 across the category. Great. Look, thank you, everyone, for your questions and your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, I am really proud of what Zoetis delivered in 2021, having our best year ever. And we see that positive momentum really continuing into 2022, as I think you heard today from both Wetteny and myself, we will continue to build on our diverse global portfolio and really our strength in pet care, diagnostics and emerging markets to grow faster than the market in 2022 and beyond. And we are committed to the investments in talent, technology, manufacturing and innovation that will spur our future growth. So, thanks so much, everybody, and talk to you soon."

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin and good morning everyone. 2021 was an exceptional year for us with revenue of $7.8 billion and adjusted net income of $2.2 billion both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 16% on a reported basis and 15% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 21% on a reported basis and 19% operationally. Looking deeper into the 2021 numbers, price contributed 1% to full year operational revenue growth, with volume contributing 14%. Volume growth consisted of 6% from other inline products, 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio and 3% from key dermatology products. Revenue growth was again broad-based with the U.S. growing 14% and international growing 17% operationally. Our strong performance was driven by our innovative, diverse and durable companion animal portfolio, which grew 27% operationally. Our livestock business, which faced generic competition on key franchises as well as challenging macro conditions in certain markets, grew 1% operationally on a year-over-year basis. Performance in companion animal was led by our small animal parasiticide portfolio bolstered by full year sales of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $425 million, an increase of $305 million compared to 2020 sales. Sales of Simparica also grew double-digits for the year, with operational revenue growth of 13%. For the year, the Simparica franchise grew 82% operationally, with revenue of approximately $0.75 billion. Our key dermatology products performed incredibly well, growing 24% operationally with approximately $1.2 billion in revenue for the year, performing above our expectations. Our diagnostics portfolio grew 21% operationally in the year, with strong contributions from our U.S. and international segments and we will continue to make meaningful investments in the coming years to drive global growth. We do believe the adoption of diagnostics products and services outside the U.S. represents larger growth opportunities geographically and feel we are favorably positioned to capture future growth in those markets. Our livestock performance in 2021 depicts the importance of geographical diversification. Generic competition and challenging market conditions weighed on our U.S. performance, but were offset by solid growth internationally, primarily in emerging markets. The modest livestock growth on a global basis was in line with our expectations for the year. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, we posted another strong quarter, with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 9% on both a reported and operational basis. Adjusted net income of $474 million is an increase of 8% on a reported basis and 5% operationally, of the 9% operational revenue growth, 1% from price and 8% from volume. Volume growth of 8% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio, 2% from key dermatology products and 1% from other inline products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of [indiscernible] growth, growing 21% operationally, with livestock 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Small animal parasiticides were the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, where our innovative and diverse fleet, tick and heartworm portfolio grew 32% operationally. Simparica Trio posted revenue of $124 million, representing operational growth of 106% versus the comparable 2020 period and the third consecutive quarter with sales exceeding $100 million. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, again, had significant global growth in the quarter, with $360 million of revenue, representing 23% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 27% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our livestock business declined 6% in the quarter as a result of generic competition for DRAXXIN on favorable market conditions in the U.S., primarily resulting from elevated input costs as well as softer conditions in China, losses driven by reduced pork prices. Our fish business grew double-digits in the quarter and along with the strength of our emerging markets, partially offset the broader decline. Overall, livestock performance in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectations. Now, moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter, U.S. revenue grew 9%, with companion animal products growing 20% and livestock sales declining by 13%. U.S. pet care vet practice trends remained robust in Q4, with practice revenue growing approximately 8% with visits growing 3% despite challenging prior year comps. Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales from our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. We are driving growth in both therapeutic areas by making meaningful investments, primarily through direct-to-consumer advertising and field force and we continue to be pleased by the return on investment the programs are yielding. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter, with sales of $114 million growing more than 100%. We also met our clean penetration target and continued to take share within the clinics. Key dermatology sales were $216 million for the quarter, growing 22% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each growing significantly. Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as the large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain untreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. U.S. livestock fell 13% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business, which as expected, was challenged by generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Our poultry business was negatively affected by reduced disease pressure from smaller flock sizes as well as generic competition, while swine faced competitive pricing pressure on anti-infectives and vaccine products. Moving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 8% on a reported and operational basis in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally and livestock revenue declined 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our key dermatology products, our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of OA pain and our parasiticide portfolio. Several key brands are benefiting from our international DTC campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. Overall, companion animal grew double-digits operationally in every major market in the quarter. We are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, with Librela generating $15 million and Solensia delivering $3 million in fourth quarter sales. In the fourth quarter, Librela became the number one pain product in the EU in its first year, with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates were in excess of 90% and compliance rates exceeded our initial expectations. In the past, we have highlighted the significant opportunity to expand the pain market. Therefore, we were extremely pleased to see approximately 40% of Librela and Solensia sales or from patients receiving medication for the first time. International livestock declined 2% operationally in the quarter as declines in cattle and swine were partially offset by growth in fish and poultry. Cattle declines were largely in the EU and Canada as generic competition for DRAXXIN weighed on sales. The decline in swine sales was primarily the result of lower pork prices in China negatively impacting producer profitability. Our fish portfolio grew double-digits again this quarter driven primarily by growth of Alpha Flux in Chile and the growth in poultry was largely attributed to further key account penetration. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter, adjusted gross margin of 69.6% increased 190 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year resulted from favorable product mix, lower inventory charges, favorable FX and price. This was partially offset by higher freight, manufacturing and other costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with compensation-related costs being the primary driver of the 15% operational increase in SG&A as well as 3% operational increase in R&D expenses. Increased international advertising and promotion expense for key brands also contributed to higher SG&A, while R&D had increased project spend in the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6%, an increase of 510 basis points, driven by the impact of prior year discrete tax benefits and changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 5% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 6% operationally for the quarter. In December, we announced a 30% annual dividend increase continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $200 million of Zoetis shares and announced the authorization of a $3.5 billion multiyear share repurchase program. Because we generate significant free cash flow, we have the ability to grow our business through organic investments and business development and return excess cash to shareholders without consuming our cash balance or being dependent on elevated leverage. Now moving on to guidance for 2022, please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting an unfavorable foreign exchange impact versus prior year by approximately $160 million on revenue, which is roughly 200 basis points and approximately $0.12 on EPS, which is about 250 basis points. For 2022, we are projecting revenue between $8.325 billion and $8.475 billion, representing 9% to 11% operational growth. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse parasiticide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and the growth in point-of-care diagnostics and reference labs. We see a very favorable companion animal backdrop for 2022 while expecting certain vet clinics trends to moderate over time we believe they will remain above pre-pandemic levels. The catalyst for growth in 2022 and beyond stem from a younger pet owner demographic and the standard of care increases, which took shape over the prior 2 years. Our innovative portfolio, geographic representation and significant investments in key brands have us positioned extremely well to capture a meaningful portion of that growth. We anticipate modest livestock growth again in 2022 led by the contributions of our emerging markets. The macro trends which makes livestock and essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023. I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. Beginning with companion animal, we do not assume a triple combination product will launch in the U.S. in 2022 to compete against Simparica Trio or competitive entrants for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. As Kristin mentioned, in 2022, we expect Librela to become a blockbuster product in the first full year of sales with revenue exceeding $100 million largely from the EU markets. We remain very optimistic about the potential of Solensia as well. While the revenue curve will have a different shape due to the lack of an established feline pain market, we review Solensia as a long-term blockbuster product, which suggested a significant unmet need in animal health. In livestock, we expect generic competition to negatively impact DRAXXIN revenue by approximately 20% in 2022 comparable to the impact we saw this year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29%, where favorable product mix and price are expected to generate margin expansion. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.07 billion and $2.12 billion with the increase from 2021 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth, including investments to support new and existing products as well as diagnostics. Adjusted R&D expense for 2022 is expected to be between $540 million and $560 million. Zoetis is the leader in animal health because of the novel products, disruptive innovation and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. Our internal R&D engine remains the primary source of innovation, and we are committed to ensuring it will continue to be significantly funded as a priority in capital allocation. Adjusted interest and other income inductions are expected to be approximately $240 million, representing a minimal year-over-year change. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2022 is expected to be approximately 20%. The increase in 2022 is primarily related to the favorable impact of foreign derived intangible income and nonrecurring net discrete tax benefits that occurred in 2021. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.415 billion to $2.470 billion, representing operational growth of 10% to 13%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We are anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures in 2022 primarily related to investments in manufacturing expansions in Ireland, the U.S. and China. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.09 to $5.19 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.87. While guidance represents our expectations for full year financials, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth in 2022. We expect top line growth to be fairly consistent between the first half and second half of the year. However, due to the impact of generic competition for DRAXXIN, isolated supply constraints and the continued weakness of our swine business in China, we expect growth in the first quarter of 2022 to be lower than the remaining three quarters. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support revenue growth, primarily in companion animal, including diagnostics, along with very challenging comparative periods for T&E and other expenses, will impact Q1 materially more than the subsequent quarters. Now to summarize, 2021 was another exceptional year, our best performing year with 15% operational revenue growth and 19% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our guidance for 2022 reflects the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and establish new markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Yes. So let me take that first. With respect to Trio, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Trio and really the entire Simparica franchise. When you look at Trio, we delivered $124 million of revenue in the quarter. When you look across the franchise, we continue to see really strong growth. For the year, the franchise grew 82% across the board, so very pleased with that. And we're putting significant investments behind the product and across Simparica as well in markets where you don't see heartworm being prevalent. And so we've seen Simparica grow 13% on the year. And so we continue to make those investments in our field force as well as advertising and DTC campaigns across \u2013 our confidence is that we will continue to see growth even when this competitor is in this space. We have seen that in other cases where other products have come into the market. When you look at the fleet tick heartworm market, it's the biggest market within animal health with $5 billion, and there are other products in the space that have better sizes of $800 million-plus. So as we look here, we continue to see more headroom to continue to grow this brand and this franchise even when there is competition. When I look at price, we delivered 1% of growth in price net in 2021. And we're probably looking at about the same sort of range when we think about 2022. You have to keep in mind while we see opportunities to take price across the board, particularly in companion animal and behind our innovative brands and seeing really strong demand in the end markets. We will continue to pull that lever. In terms of what's going the other way, as you're aware, DRAXXIN is one with competitive \u2013 generic competition there with respect to that as well as Zoamix in BMD, we've seen that sort of partially offset, I would say, but we still delivered a net price increase in 2021 and we believe even as we look to offset inflation as we have done in 2021, we will have the opportunity to do that. We do look at price on a market-by-market and SKU-by-SKU basis. And so we deliberated about where we can be more aggressive, and we will take those opportunities as we go through. Yes. And I would just add with Librela in the fourth quarter, we were deliberate about holding back even new patients coming on. We just want to make sure that we can secure the inputs so that when it all comes on, they can stay on given that it's chronic OA pain conditions. So \u2013 and we've been able to secure materials and be able to run, and we're confident in in our forecasted demand here to be able to manufacture and deliver those. Yes, we continue to be very excited about the diagnostics space with growth above the animal health space in general. If you look at 2021, we delivered 21% growth in diagnostics across the year and particularly when you look at \u2013 although we grew both across U.S. and international. And we've always said that international was the more level playing field where we look to be aggressive and we continue to make investments across field force, reference labs, etcetera, here. You've seen us innovate in this space with Imagyst, the first AI platform with \u2013 indication. We look at additional indications coming on there as well. And so we will continue to make those investments, and diagnostics is one of our key growth drivers as we look ahead. Yes, sure. Let me take both. So, going to your first question with respect to Librela, as we said in the prepared commentary, we continue to anticipate approval sometime late in 2022, that is hedging on an inspection that the FDA has to do at a facility outside the U.S. By the time this product gets approved and as we continue to leverage our global manufacturing footprint and our plans, we anticipate having the manufacturing capacity that we need to meet demand across the market. Now, we will certainly leverage our learnings from our launches outside the U.S. in terms of how we go about executing that with respect to early experience programs, etcetera. But at this point, we are confident in our ability to manufacture to meet customer commitments across that product when it gets approved. Now, going on to operating margins, as we have said, we see opportunity to really invest behind a number of areas to drive long-term sustainable growth. And we are doing so, whether you look at R&D, investments in our field force, for example, investments in advertising campaigns, DTC campaigns behind our brands that we can really drive growth in \u2013 particularly in areas where we have an advantage like being the only triple combination in the U.S. as we speak as well as in the derm area. As we do that, we will be aggressive, but we are mindful to grow the bottom line faster than the top line. And that may narrow the range that you see from time-to-time. But certainly, the business has the ability to continue to expand margins, and we have demonstrated that. But we are going to be aggressive about those opportunities when we see them, which may narrow that range. In terms of how long do we continue to see that, as long as we see the opportunity to continue to drive growth and grab more share, we will execute on those, but be mindful of that value proposition. Yes, absolutely. Look, one of the most remarkable things, at least in my first year here, that I have come to realize is what we are seeing in terms of trends on companion animal not just in the U.S., but we are seeing them across the emerging markets. Now if you step back, international is still about just over 50% of our international revenues, our livestock and companion animal is about just over 40%. However, the pace of growth that we are seeing across markets, I am comparing absolutely phenomenal. Markets like China that used to be mostly livestock is now about 50% companion animal. And elsewhere, even when we talk about Brazil, we are seeing a really great year across cattle, etcetera. Brazil is growing double digits in companion animal. So, we believe those trends \u2013 those same reasons that are driving growth for companion animal, where pet owners prioritize the health of their pets and are willing to spend more on them, we are seeing those across international markets and we see those outpacing growth versus livestock, although we have seen livestock growth in international markets, as Kristin mentioned. It was 8% growth in livestock in 2021 across our international markets. And if you look at species, fish, for example, is 100% of our fish business is outside the U.S. So, that's one area of growth that we anticipate as well. So hopefully, that gives you some color looking across international."

In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. Your line will be muted when you complete your question. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2021 Earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projection. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.  Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or US GAAP. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and in the Company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 4th, 2021. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered strong results. Again, this quarter with 10% operational growth in both revenue and adjusted net income driven by our innovative portfolio of petcare parasiticides and dermatology products. Our US business grew revenue 7% operationally, while international grew revenue 14% operationally. In terms of species, our Companion Animal portfolio generated 19% operational revenue growth in the quarter with great performance in markets around the world. Our latest innovation in parasiticides, the triple combination Simparica Trio is increasing its global adoption. Our groundbreaking dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, continue to redefine and expand the category.  And we completed the first full quarter of sales for both of our new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia. These new products are exceeding expectations and receiving very positive feedback from veterinarians and pet owners in European markets, where they've been launched. When you add all of this to our growth in diagnostics for Companion Animals, I see our business continuing to capitalize on the positive demographics for pets. Increased spending on pet wellness and treatment will be sustainable well beyond the pandemic. And our portfolio and pipeline habits well-positioned to continue leading and innovating in this market. Livestock product sales continue to present a more complex picture for the industry and Zoletis with market dynamics vary widely by species and geographies. As we expected, our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally in the third quarter, largely due to generic competition across, cattle, poultry, and swine and most significantly in the US We have taken proactive strategies to protect these product lines, including the introduction of a lifecycle innovation like drafting KP. But pricing pressure remains due to the increasing effects of generic competition. On the positive side, we saw 7% operational growth for livestock and international as markets like Brazil, Chile, and other emerging markets performed well.  Our long-term advantage in livestock continues to be our diverse portfolio and strength across geographies and product categories like medicines, vaccines, and medicated feed additives. We also continue to invest in R&D programs that align with our customers long-term needs for more efficient and sustainable production methods, which can be built anew therapies, analytics and digital solutions. We remain on track for a record setting year with updated guidance for operational revenue growth in the range of 14% to 14.5% and adjusted net income growth in the range of 16.5% to 18% for 2021.  Our major catalyst for growth has performed well this year and have more runway ahead for 2022 and beyond. And when do we make the right investments and continue successfully executing our growth strategies. Our strength in petcare has an incredibly strong foundation across parasiticide, dermatology and vaccine. To the first 9 months of 2021, our Companion Animal portfolio has grown 29% operationally. We also remain very excited about the long-term blockbuster potential of our new monoclonal antibody franchises in pain, Librela and Solensia, as they grow in Europe and we make progress on approvals in the US We currently expect approval of Solensia in the US in the first half of 2022, with Librela remaining more likely in the second half.  Our revenue growth in international markets has been 20% operationally to the first 9 months, driven by China, Brazil, and other emerging markets. We continue to expect growth to come across both our Companion Animal and livestock portfolios in these markets. Finally, our diagnostics portfolio remains a key catalyst for growth with 28% operational growth through the first 9 months. We are gaining significant traction with our expansion of the point-of-care portfolio in markets outside the US We always believed international expansion was one of the biggest value drivers for the Abaxis acquisition once we combine that portfolio with the global Zoetis footprint.  The acceleration of international growth for diagnostics is a very positive sign and continues gaining momentum. We also recently added digital cytology testing to our VetScan images platform in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This means we can now offer a network of expert remote pathologists, in addition to artificial intelligence technology for fecal testing. We're seeing our strongest early adoption of VetScan images in Germany, Australia, Spain, and the UK. And we will continue developing additional applications for the platform over time. In addition to our ongoing investments in R&D programs and direct-to-consumer campaigns, we are investing in manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demands for our new parasiticide products and monoclonal antibody therapies.  Expansions are underway at our sites in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Tullamore, Ireland. All of these are significant multiyear projects to ensure we have ongoing reliable supply, while maintaining a diverse global network of third-party contract manufacturers that give us the greatest flexibility and redundancy. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job over the last two years to optimize inventory levels of key products, while minimizing the impact of a challenging global supply landscape. We continue to carefully monitor and manage our supply chain and inventories.  And finally, before I hand things off to Wetteny, I wanted to note our recent news about changes in our R&D leadership team. Long-time R&D leader, Cathy Knupp will be retiring at the end of the year and ensuring a smooth transition through February. I am very grateful to Cathy for building the most innovative and productive R&D organization in the animal health industry. And for leaving us with a rich pipeline of future innovations and R&D talent, which includes her successor, Rob Polzer. Robin has been with Zoletis since 2015. Working on many of the innovations that have come to market recently in parasiticides and monoclonal antibodies.  He has experienced running our global therapeutics and biologic R&D organization and is the right leader for the future of innovation at Zoetis. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another great quarter and bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers every day. We are confident in the updated guidance we have provided and see the fundamental growth drivers of our business continuing into 2022 and beyond. Now, let me hand things over to Wetteny.\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin and good morning, everyone. The focus of my comments today will be on our third quarter financial results, the contributing factors that drove our performance and an update of our improved full-year 2021 guidance. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 11% on a reported basis, and 10% operationally. Adjusted net income of $597 million was an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Operationally revenue grew 10% with 2% from price and 8% from volume. Run growth is comprised of 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio, and 3% from our online portfolio, primarily our key dermatology franchise. Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter.  Companion Animal products again led the way in terms of species growth, growing 19% operationally, with livestock declining 2% operationally in the quarter. Our parasiticide portfolio made the largest contribution to Companion Animal growth driven by sales of Simparica Trio and continues strength across our broader portfolio including the Proheart franchise, Simparica, and Revolution Stronghold Plus. We also saw robust growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Simparica Trio had another exceptional quarter posting revenue of $122 million, representing operational growth of 140% versus the comparable 2020 period, with year-to-date sales of $350 million.  We believe the global fleet second hardware market will continue to expand and that our broad and innovative portfolio, which were 32% operationally in the quarter has us well-positioned to capture share and outpace our competitors. Global sales of our key dermatology products were $321 million in the quarter, growing 26% operationally. Total sales exceeded $300 million for the first time in Company history. And we remain ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in dermatology sales for the year. Our diagnostics portfolio had operational sales growth of 7% in Q3 against a very challenging comparative period as the third quarter of 2020 had a sharp increase in wellness visits following wide fill clinic closures in the second quarter.  Our International Diagnostics portfolio performed very well, which as Kristin mentioned, was a key component for the strategic rationale of the Abaxis acquisition. Diagnostics remains the key growth driver for Zoetis, and we will continue to make significant investments in new technology, expand our reference [Indiscernible] footprint, as well as provide flexible solutions to our customers. Our equine products delivered strong results with operational sales growth of 20% in the quarter as horse shows and racing return to pre-pandemic levels and field growth in vaccines, as well as nutritional and pain products.  The expected decline in livestock in the quarter was primarily driven by our US cattle and US poultry businesses as our international segment delivered operational growth across all species. Globally, our cattle business declined 5% operationally in the quarter driven by the impact of generic competition for DRAXXIN and a difficult comparative quarter resulting from COVID-19 dynamics and earlier fall cattle run in the US in the third quarter of 2020. Poultry also declined in the quarter as producers in the US rotated to lower-cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of current market dynamics. Sales were also negatively impacted by generic competition of Zoamix and BMD, our alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives.  The decline in cattle and poultry offset the growth in fish. Swine was essentially flat in the quarter as decline in the US, primarily from pricing pressure on our anti-infective and vaccine portfolio as a result of generic competition, offset the growth internationally from further key account expansion. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, bench marked against a very difficult prior-year comparative period on both the Companion Animal and livestock sides of our business. Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue growth of 7%. Sales of Companion Animal products grew 17%, and lifestyle product sales declined by 13%.  For Companion Animal, Petcare trends continued to be robust. Vet clinic revenue and patient visits grew again this quarter against growth rates from the third quarter of last year, which were well above historical levels. Our view remains unchanged that certain trends will moderate, but we remain above pre-pandemic levels. Growth in US Companion Animal was led by our parasiticides portfolio and our key dermatology products. Simparica Trio continues to perform well, with US sales of $110 million and year-to-date sales north of $300 million.  This quarter is also an excellent representation of our commitment to invest in the broader parasiticide portfolio as we launched the targeted DTC campaign for Proheart and prevalent heartworm geographies. Key dermatology sales were $270 million in the US for the quarter, growing 20% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. US diagnostic sales grew 2% in the quarter, which as I mentioned earlier had a very difficult comparative period. However, year-to-date performance has been strong at 23% growth. US livestock sales declined 13% in the quarter.  Our US cattle business faced the comparative period that's a robust growth at third quarter performance of 2020 benefited from an early for cattle run and pent-up demand work its way through the system. In addition, generic competition had not entered the market in the third quarter of 2020. Our generic defense strategy has been successful as we have been able to maintain a greater volume share of the [Indiscernible] market than originally expected. Although additional generics will likely enter the market in the coming quarters. From an end market perspective, producer profitability remains challenged by input costs, primarily feed and labor.  US poultry sales declined in the quarter as smaller flocks resulted in lower disease pressure, allowing producers to expand usage of lower-cost alternatives through our highly efficacious premium products. In addition, generic competition is creating pricing pressure on our Zoamix NBNT franchises. To summarize, our US operations delivered another strong quarter driven by our innovative and robust Companion Animal products along with petcare and markets, displaying very strong fundamentals. The near-term weakness in our US livestock business has been expected and has been more than offset by the strengthened Companion Animal, which demonstrate the importance of diversification across species.  Now, turning to our international segment. Revenue of our International segment grew 14% operational in the quarter with Companion Animal revenue growing 24%, and livestock revenue growing 7% operationally. In the second half of 2020, we saw a material uptick in medicalization rates and standard of care by pet owners, a trend which has continued through the third quarter of this year. We entered and made significant investments in advertising promotion to capitalize on favorable market conditions and drive growth. Companion Animal achieved broad-based growth internationally in the quarter, led by strong performance of our key dermatology products.  Through 3 quarters of 2021, year-to-date sales are in excess of total sales on the entire prior year. In addition, we are in the early stages of a DTC campaign for key dermatology, which we expect will create additional demand for our products. Paracitisides had a strong quarter internationally, led by significant growth in the Simparica franchise, which benefited from DTC campaigns and drove growth in Brazil, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Librela our monoclonal antibody for alleviation of [Indiscernible] pain in dogs, has done extremely well, generating $15 million in quarterly sales in a select number of markets.  Feedback from veterinarians and pet owners on the quality-of-life improvement for the patients has been extremely encouraging. Our feline monoclonal antibody for alleviation of [Indiscernible] pain Solensia, had positive feedback from the early experience programs in Q2 and launched in the EU this quarter. [Indiscernible] in cats is a significant unmet need in animal health and our view is that Solensia will become a blockbuster product, with the pain market for cats becoming approximately a $200 million global category overtime. Our international diagnostics portfolio grew 20% operationally in the quarter, with significant growth in consumable and instrument revenue. And strong growth across a number of geographies such as the UK, Australia, China, and various other markets.  Moving onto livestock, our international business again delivered growth across all species, led by strong operational growth in cattle and fish. Cattle growth in the quarter was driven by further key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil, in several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 21% operationally. Growth in our fish portfolio was primarily the result of increased sales of our Alpha Flux Sea lice treatment product, as well as strong growth in vaccines. Performance in swine and poultry were also fueled by growth in key accounts, as well as overall market growth, primarily emerging markets.  At a market level view for international segment, all major markets grew operational in the third quarter with the exception of France, which was essentially flat in Q3. Emerging markets was again a key contributor to our international performance, led by Brazil, which was 22% on an operational basis. As we expected, growth in China slowed in the third quarter as lower pork prices challenged with this or profitability. However, the Companion Animal business in China, which grew double-digits once again, offset the weakness in swine. Overall, total emerging markets has grown significantly in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our international segment again delivered strong results of robust growth in Companion Animal and growth across all species in livestock.  On a year-to-date basis, our international segment has grown 20% operationally with our Companion Animal and livestock businesses, each growing double-digits. While following pork prices in China are creating a headwind that is moderating growth in swine, it is more than offset by the growth across other species and markets for the demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography.  Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.7% increased 110 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as favorable product mix for an exchange, low inventory charges and price were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 19% operationally, with SG&A expenses growing 20% operationally resulting from increased compensation-related costs, as well as increased advertising and promotion expense, freight, and T&E. Our [Indiscernible] expenses were 17% operationally driven by higher project spend.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, a decrease of 330 basis points due to favorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings including increased favorability related to foreign derived and tangible income, and an increase in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable third quarter. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower effective tax rate.  Our liquidity position remains very healthy. And in the third quarter were $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents following a $600 million repayment of long-term debt in August. Our financial flexibilities in a very strong position, which allows us to make meaningful investments in our business while returning excess cash to shareholders, as demonstrated by our repurchase of Zoetis shares of approximately $200 million in the quarter. Now, moving on to our updated guidance for 2021 through a raising and narrowing as a result of our performance in the third quarter and confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable future growth. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-October.  For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $7.7 billion and.$7.75 billion and operational revenue growth between 14% and 14.5% for the full-year versus the 12.5% to 13.5% in our August guidance. Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.91 billion and $1.94 billion versus $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion in our prior guidance.  The guidance rate largely represents additional compensation-related costs, as well as increased advertising and promotion spend to support growth of new products and key franchises. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.2 billion and $2.225 billion, representing operational growth of 16.5% to 18% compared to our prior guidance of 13% to 15%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.67, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.23 to $4.29. Now, to summarize, before we move to Q&A.  Three quarters, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom-line growth with revenue growing 17% operationally. And again, raised and narrowed our full-year 2021 guidance. We have achieved significant growth across our key franchises and are extremely excited about our new product launches, and product pipeline. Now, I hand things over to our operator to open the line for your questions. Operator.\nOperator: And at this time, [Operator Instructions]. Again, in the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and re-queue again with any follow-ups, your line will be muted when you complete your question. Today's first question comes from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys and congrats on a strong quarter and raised the guide. I want to start on DRAXXIN real quick. You touched on generic impact in US livestock a number of times in your remarks, we assume that's predominantly from DRAXXIN. Can you give us an update if you're seeing any stabilization there or are you expecting for the headwinds in 4Q '22 or 4Q or 2022 or given those trends improve and stabilize from here?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Thank you. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter and position to raise a guidance once again for the year. With respect to DRAXXIN, as expected, we continue to see the effect of the LOE and DRAXXIN was down about $15 million in the quarter. Now, our defense strategy here is working well and we are largely maintaining our market share although that does have the effect on price. So, we're very pleased with how the product is performing as well as DRAXXIN KP in terms of maintaining largely the market share from a volume perspective here. As we look forward, we are expecting further generic competitors to come into this space from a DRAXXIN perspective, and that we believe will continue into next year as well.\nKristin Peck: And the only thing I would add there, as we said, this is completely in line with our expectations, not just that we gave this year, but that we've been talking about when the generic enters. We generally said it takes somewhere between 20% to 40% over a number of years. We said in the beginning of this year that that would likely be a little faster and we're on track to be doing that. We expect probably somewhere around a 20% head-on price for us on this product in the year. So, in line with the expectations, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. So, as we start to think about 2022, what are some of the pushes and pulls hereperce for example, will recovery from food services and restaurants be a tailwind in 2022 for livestock? And what else should we be thinking about? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Louise. We are really excited for a number of the growth drivers that we saw this year, which we really think will continue into next year. I think our strength in parasiticide, our strength in derm, I mean, that will be a billion dollars this year growing at 26% in the quarter. Diagnostics, again, year-to-date, 28%, we think continues into next year, really strong performance in our emerging markets. China, Brazil, and other emerging, which I think will continue into next year, not to mention our pain monoclonal antibodies. So, I think we have a lot of the growth drivers this year that we think will continue into next year.  I mean, obviously things we're going to watch for next year, there could be headwinds for us. Could be the timing of competition for potential product against Apoquel or Simparica Trio, as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, we're not really expecting that until the second half of 2022. Again, we don't have great visibility into that. Obviously, we think [Indiscernible], once we lap some of this draft and impact that will lessen as a real headwind for us. But overall, we really think that durable growth drivers you saw this year really continue into next year and we're pretty confident about that.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Thanks so much. If I can maybe follow up on the revenue outlook, Wetteny, for 4Q. I think historically 4Q has been a bit of a stronger quarter. You mentioned the competition on DRAXXIN. Is there any other dynamic that we should have in mind in terms of the revenue cadence for the fourth quarter? And I guess, with the focus on inflation and cost pressures in the market, do you feel like you've seen any pre-buying of products or stocking up from customers in either the livestock or companion business. Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Sure. Look, we continue to see really strong underlying market dynamics overall. And our portfolio is really well-positioned and continues to perform very well against those dynamics. As we discussed on the prior earnings call, what we're seeing in terms of growth rates in the second half of this year is more reflection of how the phasing occurred last year versus this year, given our position in the market. Again, the strong market dynamics that we continue to face here. If you look at last year, the second half had almost 17% more revenue in the back half in the first half of last year.  And so that's really what's driving the comp here. Those are the phasing of last year where this year is a little bit more normalized. As Kristin just referenced, we see a number of growth drivers for us, not only from the overall market, but also our portfolio across [Indiscernible], as we look at pain, diagnostics as well, with the one area -- the area that we're watching, including DRAXXIN. To your point around inflation, is you know given our portfolio and innovative products that we have and demand we see for those products, they position us well to take price. And you saw a 2% price in the quarter included in 10% operational growth.  And we'll continue to look at opportunities to continue to do that as we go into next year, you saw in the quarter our gross margins actually expanded by 110 basis points versus last year Q3, and so that despite some headwinds in the areas of freight, etc. So, we'll continue to monitor those and take price where we can give the innovative products that we bring to the market [Indiscernible]\nOperator: And our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. See if I can [Indiscernible] a couple. The first on livestock and quite honestly was pleasantly surprised by the international livestock up 7% operationally. There's just a lot of noise out there with other companies and swine chatter. So, I guess the first question is, was that a clean number? No pull forwards and maybe just talk to this market overall, do you still view it as a low single-digit grower for you this year with eventual improvement to mid-single-digit in call it '22/'23? And then just a pivot, Kristin or Wetteny.  I know we're not going to get a 2022 guide, but maybe conceptually at a high level, how do we think of '22 in terms of a year where the delta -- how do we think about the delta between revenue and EPS growth? And I guess where I'm going with this is a lot of innovation for you where you're still dominating the market. So conceptually, do we just think about it as another year of spending, supporting the portfolio of DTC where the delta between those 2 revenues -- revs and EPS might be a little bit tighter than prior years? And sorry for the long-winded questions. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll take the first part of the question then I will let Wetteny take the second half, Jon. Livestock is a complex picture. So, I think your insight is quite well-founded. In the sense of not just the difference between US and international, but the difference between the specie. So, as you rightly mentioned, the US was down significantly in livestock and that's pretty much generic competition against DRAXXIN, Zoamix and some other products that we mentioned before. But to your point, international was up 7% and that was still with a really rough time in China as you saw in the quarter with China livestock down about 10%, but more than made up for by China's Companion Animal.  And really it has to do with the mix between species that are growing quite quickly for us like fish, cattle, and poultry, maybe struggling but you look at strong growth in emerging markets, which is what's really booing livestock. And as we've said in previous quarters, how US livestock goes does not mean how overall lifestyle goes. So, I think we really, the diversity of our portfolio across species, across geographies continues to really be one of the strengths for us at least. And we do think overall you'll see a flat to low single-digit growth overall across the Company for us in livestock, that maybe a little bit slower than the market, as we said, because of DRAXXIN and some of the key LOEs that we have.  And ultimately, once we lap some of those LOEs, we think you do go back in '23, '24 to a mid-single-digit exactly where we've always been. So, the historic growth of livestock is around 4%. And as we said, we think it absolutely returns there. And what's the reason to believe? Well, if we're growing international in the quarter at 7%, and really the US is mostly getting hit by the generic. Once we lap those, we do believe you can get back to a livestock growth in the sort of mid-single digits, the way it historically has been. But I'll Wetteny take your second question.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. As we've discussed just before here, we're well-positioned, going out of this year into next year, to continue to sustain growth beyond this year. In terms of how you might see things flow through the P&L, our long-term value proposition is to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. We don't see any reason to depart from that. However, given the opposition across a number of really key brands and demand that we see, we'll take the opportunity to invest behind those brands to drive DTC by other awareness campaigns, etc. We're also are investing in R&D, as well as Diagnostics and other areas that we believe will help us accelerate and enhance growth going forward. So that may, at times, cause that difference to be a little bit tighter as you said, from time to time, but it's to drive that growth -- that enhanced level of growth that we see, given the opportunity that we see in the market.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Okay. Thanks. Can you provide us any metrics on the contributions from Librela and Solensia in the quarter or any metrics around reorder rates of the products in certain markets and how the launch is progressing relative to your expectations at this point in the expected timeline again for the US launch. And then second, just more broadly on Companion Animal trends. Any monthly metrics you can give us over the course of the quarter and kind of what's expected for the fourth quarter and beyond in terms of the underlying demand trends across that market? Thanks.\nWetteny Joseph: We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Librela and Solensia in the European markets where we've launched the product. The feedback has been very, very strong from vet and pet owners as well. We saw $50 million of revenue from Librela in the quarter and about $2 million from Solensia. Again, really the first full quarter of those products being in those select markets for us. In terms of where we're expecting approval for next year and we continue to expect approval for Librela as Kristin mentioned, in the first half of the year.\nKristin Peck: Solensia.\nWetteny Joseph: I'm sorry. Solensia in the first half. Sorry about that.\nKristin Peck: No worries.\nWetteny Joseph: Solensia in the first half. With Librela, more likely in the second half of the year in the US.\nKristin Peck: And I'll take the second half of your question, Erin, with regards to US Companion Animal trends. We don't have the monthly data, but just putting some of this in context, we believe that we look at the data overall right now. We're seeing overall vet clinic revenue growing 7%, which is higher than the historical rate. It's been a little bumpy over the year. I mean, weather, lots of different dynamics have been driving it. You saw 8% in Q1, 14% in Q2., we are seeing 7%. The way we sort of see this is, we think it overall will be higher than historical norms. Is it -- is the double-digit that you saw consistently in 2020?  No, but I don't think -- we saw very weak as you saw in Q1 and there's a huge bounce back in the second half as we saw last year, we do think that revenue at that clinic will continue to grow above historical rates. We're not really sure, as I said last quarter that we think that's going to be double-digit, but historically it grew 5 to 6. Is it going to be 7 to 8? I think our view is it will still be stronger than normal, but maybe not in the double-digits overall. But I mean, its still seeing strength, if you -- anyone of you who have been trying to get an appointment for your dog or your cat at the vet, it's pretty challenging to get one. So mostly because the demand really does remain high there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan, please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I just -- my question on the derm portfolio, you've built a billion-dollar franchise here, but it's really about competition coming in 2022 or beyond. What are you anticipating in terms of the impact that a competitor launch could have? I think historically you've talked about a second entry, more building the market than maybe directly cannibalizing your existing business. But I guess as you've had a longer window of time to develop this, do we reach a point where that competitive launch, I guess, more impacts your growth versus -- I guess the heart of the question is, how much more room is there for market expansion as a new player comes in? Thanks so much.\nKristin Peck: Sure, thanks Chris. Yes, I mean, our derm portfolio has continued to grow and I think what we've really discovered is there still a large number of untreated animals out there. So, if you look at, we still believe there are 7,000,000 dogs that are diagnosed with some form of itchiness that are still not being treated. We do believe there's significant market growth. There's still geographic expansion. We've really invested heavily in direct-to-consumer advertising to grow this market. People are home more with their pets.  They're spending more time. So, I think people are really starting to notices itch and bothering them more maybe than it did historically. So, they are seeking help. We've also really invested in programs such as in the US are Petcare rewards program, which it making customers loyal to our product. So, we have been expecting competition to be frank. We probably thought it would've happened before now, but we think there's lots of rooms to continue to grow this market. And so, will it remain at 26% of you saw in the quarter? Our growth might go down a little bit, but I still think this will be a growing market for us, just given the large number of untreated dogs in the US and around the globe.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for questions. Main focus on China, but the [Indiscernible] and it's because you often spoken about China as a major market, understandably. Can you help us understand the expectation that are in the market and any comparative range of prizes that you think this market would support? And also, far behind would applicable to be in terms of getting introduced are launched in China. Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yeah, I'll start and see what Kristin what's to add here with respect to China. As expected, we saw growth decelerate in China this quarter with about 1% growth in the quarter but keep in mind, China has actually grown 35% on a year-to-date basis. We're up against a very solid comparative on last year where we saw 63% growth in the quarter. And swine was actually up 159% in the same quarter last year. Again, the pricing dynamics [Indiscernible] which we discussed on the last call started about mid-June.  And so, we expected to see sort of decline in the pork area. Now, the other part of your question is long-term. What do we expect in the market? We do see continued opportunity to grow substantially in China over time as we bring more and more robotics to the market. But also, if you look at what's happened since African swine fever, you see a concentration more on larger producers versus backyard forms, and we think that [Indiscernible] well in terms of whole medicalization over time, as well for our premium products with respect to swine.  And then on the Companion Animal side, we continue to see really robust growth in China. In Companion Animal, we saw double-digit growth this quarter. And Companion Animal which obviously was partly offset by the swine. So long term, we continue to expect really solid growth in China, which is our second largest market, driven by the market dynamics that we discussed. Although there may be cycles that we'll see in swine as we're going through right now from a pricing standpoint.\nKristin Peck: The only thing that I could add to that, is we obviously have launched Apoquel there. It is doing well, it is growing. This is a specialty product in a market that's traditionally been mostly a primary care generalist market. So, we're really excited to grow that. And I think we have a very strong pipeline of products coming into China and new innovation that we're going to be bringing in just like we brought in Apoquel, the approval right now for Cytopoint, which has not yet launched there. And honestly lots of products behind that we're really excited to be launching in China. So, we -- it is our second largest market. We do think it's going to continue to have very strong growth. As Wetteny said, with our year-to-date at 35%, we're really bullish on our ability to continue to grow in China.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. I have a question on Librela and Solensia in Europe. There are several parts of the question. Are owners are returning monthly for the next injection or is the time between injections longer than that? What is the average patient cost of each injection? And just to clarify, I think you said Solensia in cash is $200 million opportunity. Why is that? Why is that only $200 million? Why isn't it multiples of that? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Again, I can start there. We are really pleased with Librela and yes, we are seeing animals return. I don't have the specific number of days that they're coming back. We can certainly look into that and see if we can get that data for you. It is priced at a premium to both Rimadyl, as well as to Gala plans on the market, so given it has a phenomenal, both safety and efficacy profile, it has been priced at a premium. The price obviously varies from market-to-market, so I don't think we have that overall information. With regards to the second part of your answer on Solensia, half is it quite different markets.  So, although today the market in dogs is 400 and we believe we can double it. The market is actually pretty higher to size in cats. There are very few approved products out there today to treat cats, so I hardly even say what it is. It's not zero, maybe tens of millions, it's certainly not hundreds of millions of dollars. And cats are less medicalized than dogs. So, you really have to first medicalize those cats. You have to be able to -- cats like to hide their pain. So, you also have to find a way that pet owners can notice pain in cats better and identify it and bring them to the vet.  So, the reason we've said it's a smaller market is, the number of cats that are medicalized are just smaller, and then the number that are actually treated is really small. So, the first thing is you need to be able to identify [Indiscernible] with pet owners, convince them to take their cats to the vet and build a market from scratch. Cat owners, when they used to call the vet when their cat was severing from pain, from osteoarthritis. We're told it really wasn't anything. There's no product in the US, for example, whatsoever.  So, it's really about retraining pet owners that there is a product that can meet their cat sneeze, and helping vets really bring the cat into the vet. A lot of pet owners don't like putting their cats in crates to bring them to the vet as you probably know. But we're very confident that we have a strong pipeline for cats that will increasingly medicalized cats\u2019 overtime and helped build this market. But as we said, just given the number of medicalized cats will be a smaller market than the dog space. And it will likely take a little longer to build it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Christine Rains with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nChristine Rains: Hi. Congrats on a great quarter and good morning. My question is that we noticed that Trio declined sequentially for the first time, so I was just hoping to have some color on this and how it's performing versus your expectations. Thanks.\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, we saw another strong quarter across our parasiticide franchise. Small animal parasiticide grew about 32% in the quarter with $391 billion. We've had Trio sales of $122 million, $350 million so far through this year on a year-to-date basis. The part that continues to do extremely well, particularly in our large corporate accounts, where the penetration rates about 90% and we're seeing about 80% of the order rates as well. So, we continue to gain share in this very large market.  If you recall, last year we launched the product, and so we've now -- without lapping it. And in terms of parasiticides, a sort of seasonality starts to play into [Indiscernible] in terms of what you might see as well. So, this is really in line with our expectations and we couldn't be more pleased with how the product is doing in the market. And now that we've really penetrated well with the large corporate accounts, we're now going into some of the mid-size accounts as well. So, we continue to see the product gain momentum and again, in line with our expectations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Navaan Ty with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNavaan Ty : Good morning. Can you share your stats of pet ownership going forward and average revenue per Companion Animal visit? And apologies if I missed them. And can I quickly ask are you able to comment on the EU Commission investigation to the Belgian office? I understand it was related to anti-trust allegation. Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with your question with regards to the investigation and then Wetteny can take the second half of your question on Companion Animal. On the [Indiscernible] inspection pertains to the [Indiscernible] decision to discontinue the clinical development of a single experimental drug candidate. We're working with the EC to ensure it has all the necessary information that it needs. And we are confident that we can align the concerns which are prompted the investigation. So, I think your second part of the question was on Companion Animal trends. The 7% which was broken up between 3% on traffic and 4% on spend per visit, but I don't know Wetteny if you've got any comments on that?\nWetteny Joseph: Yeah, sure. As Kristin mentioned, we saw 7% revenue growth for vet with about -- with visits up 3% and a revenue per visit up about 4%. And that's up against a prior year where we saw real increase in the third quarter in terms of vet visits, etc., given the effects of the pandemic. We continue to expect that these statistics will continue to be above pre-pandemic levels, or they would moderate from their peaks. Other -- two other important points to recall here is that if you look at pet ownership or more, we're seeing millennials and Gen-Z bring pets into their homes, and they are doing a lot more research and looking at petcare and wellness, and they are willing to spend more on their pets. So, the increase in pet ownership, we expect that to continue to provide really strong tailwind in the industry for spending on pets as we look forward and as those pets continue to age as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dave Westenberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Westenberg: Thanks. Good morning. I have a question on potential competition for Simparica Trio. I know it's been a bit of a moving target. I think initially you thought it could even happen this year and I think it's been pushed out to the rate three times, perhaps to second half of '22. Just curious. I know competitor tight-lipped about what they're doing. But any thoughts from year-end and why there continues to be a delay here, do you think it's regulatory? Or it -- could it be technical? And if it's technical, is this something that could delay competition for many years to come? And then just -- hypothetically, if competition comes into derm segment around the same time as competition comes for Simparica Trio, do you think you have the flexibility to show above segment growth during this period? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I wish we knew exactly. I mean, we had the same theories that you do that there could be certain technical reasons for some competitors. And let me be clear. Everyone's working in this space. This is the parasiticides. It's the largest single market in Animal Health at $5 billion. So, I think if you're pretty much any of the large companies we compete with, they're all trying to come up with their own triple combination. So, I don't know that it's the same thing that's holding each of the companies back.  I mean, we're not really clear. It definitely could be regulatory, it could be technical, it could be manufacturing CMC. We're not exactly clear. And to your point, there's really very few public companies who actually disclose much about their pipeline. So, our ability to know where people are is quite limited. We just -- and we always -- I know it's a little [Indiscernible] keep pushing it out. Sort of like 6 to 12 months from whenever you ask the question because we haven't seen it and we haven't heard it in corporate accounts and they're negotiating with us, we think it's definitely another 3 -- every quarterly with another 3 plus months out. And that's really where some of our back comes from.  And yes, we are confident that even if you'll see, we are planning on competition in these key products, but I think that it's the strength and diversity of our pipeline globally that makes us confident we can continue to grow above market. We've got diagnostics, we've got pain mAb. We still think you're going to be growing in [Indiscernible] to be honest with you, it's still a lot of unmet medical needs, so yes, we remain confident that we can grow above the market even if we do start to face competition in some of these key franchises.\nOperator: And we'll take a follow-up from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, thank you for the follow-up. And just a question on DRAXXIN, I mean, [Indiscernible] in detail, but I know that you've got approval for DRAXXIN KP in July, probably launches some time in Q3. So, a lot of expectations from the KPs [Indiscernible] ensure that the market stays flat or is this go for this to [Indiscernible] growth? And secondly, on the same, it seemed that 'til now [Indiscernible] launched January versions. You call out a couple of more generates. Any more are you expecting next year? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. DRAXXIN KP was part of our defense strategy. I don't think it's going to restart growth for us necessarily to market as we're seeing generic competition, but it is as Wetteny outlined in his remarks at the beginning of this call. It's helped us retain our share. It provides incremental innovation and incremental benefit to our customers and a reason, obviously, to stay with that. Yes, we have had in the US two competitor s so far. We've heard up to three more are potentially coming. I don't know why they haven't -- we would've expected them this year, so their approval -- whether or not they actually entered the market, we're not really --we not sure when and if on that, but we would've said we probably have a few more entering.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Kristin Peck for closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Great. Look, thank you everyone for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, I think we delivered another strong quarter of results driven by our diverse global portfolio and strength in Petcare parasiticides and dermatology products. We are raising our guidance for the full-year 2021 and we remain on track for a record-setting year for us. And we're continuing to invest in the areas to support our long-term growth. And we remain confident in the fundamental growth drivers for animal health and for Zoetis into 2022 and beyond. So, thanks so much for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: This will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. We delivered strong results. Again, this quarter with 10% operational growth in both revenue and adjusted net income driven by our innovative portfolio of petcare parasiticides and dermatology products. Our US business grew revenue 7% operationally, while international grew revenue 14% operationally. In terms of species, our Companion Animal portfolio generated 19% operational revenue growth in the quarter with great performance in markets around the world. Our latest innovation in parasiticides, the triple combination Simparica Trio is increasing its global adoption. Our groundbreaking dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, continue to redefine and expand the category.  And we completed the first full quarter of sales for both of our new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia. These new products are exceeding expectations and receiving very positive feedback from veterinarians and pet owners in European markets, where they've been launched. When you add all of this to our growth in diagnostics for Companion Animals, I see our business continuing to capitalize on the positive demographics for pets. Increased spending on pet wellness and treatment will be sustainable well beyond the pandemic. And our portfolio and pipeline habits well-positioned to continue leading and innovating in this market. Livestock product sales continue to present a more complex picture for the industry and Zoletis with market dynamics vary widely by species and geographies. As we expected, our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally in the third quarter, largely due to generic competition across, cattle, poultry, and swine and most significantly in the US We have taken proactive strategies to protect these product lines, including the introduction of a lifecycle innovation like drafting KP. But pricing pressure remains due to the increasing effects of generic competition. On the positive side, we saw 7% operational growth for livestock and international as markets like Brazil, Chile, and other emerging markets performed well.  Our long-term advantage in livestock continues to be our diverse portfolio and strength across geographies and product categories like medicines, vaccines, and medicated feed additives. We also continue to invest in R&D programs that align with our customers long-term needs for more efficient and sustainable production methods, which can be built anew therapies, analytics and digital solutions. We remain on track for a record setting year with updated guidance for operational revenue growth in the range of 14% to 14.5% and adjusted net income growth in the range of 16.5% to 18% for 2021.  Our major catalyst for growth has performed well this year and have more runway ahead for 2022 and beyond. And when do we make the right investments and continue successfully executing our growth strategies. Our strength in petcare has an incredibly strong foundation across parasiticide, dermatology and vaccine. To the first 9 months of 2021, our Companion Animal portfolio has grown 29% operationally. We also remain very excited about the long-term blockbuster potential of our new monoclonal antibody franchises in pain, Librela and Solensia, as they grow in Europe and we make progress on approvals in the US We currently expect approval of Solensia in the US in the first half of 2022, with Librela remaining more likely in the second half.  Our revenue growth in international markets has been 20% operationally to the first 9 months, driven by China, Brazil, and other emerging markets. We continue to expect growth to come across both our Companion Animal and livestock portfolios in these markets. Finally, our diagnostics portfolio remains a key catalyst for growth with 28% operational growth through the first 9 months. We are gaining significant traction with our expansion of the point-of-care portfolio in markets outside the US We always believed international expansion was one of the biggest value drivers for the Abaxis acquisition once we combine that portfolio with the global Zoetis footprint.  The acceleration of international growth for diagnostics is a very positive sign and continues gaining momentum. We also recently added digital cytology testing to our VetScan images platform in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. This means we can now offer a network of expert remote pathologists, in addition to artificial intelligence technology for fecal testing. We're seeing our strongest early adoption of VetScan images in Germany, Australia, Spain, and the UK. And we will continue developing additional applications for the platform over time. In addition to our ongoing investments in R&D programs and direct-to-consumer campaigns, we are investing in manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demands for our new parasiticide products and monoclonal antibody therapies.  Expansions are underway at our sites in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Lincoln, Nebraska, and Tullamore, Ireland. All of these are significant multiyear projects to ensure we have ongoing reliable supply, while maintaining a diverse global network of third-party contract manufacturers that give us the greatest flexibility and redundancy. Our supply chain team has done an excellent job over the last two years to optimize inventory levels of key products, while minimizing the impact of a challenging global supply landscape. We continue to carefully monitor and manage our supply chain and inventories.  And finally, before I hand things off to Wetteny, I wanted to note our recent news about changes in our R&D leadership team. Long-time R&D leader, Cathy Knupp will be retiring at the end of the year and ensuring a smooth transition through February. I am very grateful to Cathy for building the most innovative and productive R&D organization in the animal health industry. And for leaving us with a rich pipeline of future innovations and R&D talent, which includes her successor, Rob Polzer. Robin has been with Zoletis since 2015. Working on many of the innovations that have come to market recently in parasiticides and monoclonal antibodies.  He has experienced running our global therapeutics and biologic R&D organization and is the right leader for the future of innovation at Zoetis. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for delivering another great quarter and bringing the value of Zoetis to our customers every day. We are confident in the updated guidance we have provided and see the fundamental growth drivers of our business continuing into 2022 and beyond. Now, let me hand things over to Wetteny. And the only thing I would add there, as we said, this is completely in line with our expectations, not just that we gave this year, but that we've been talking about when the generic enters. We generally said it takes somewhere between 20% to 40% over a number of years. We said in the beginning of this year that that would likely be a little faster and we're on track to be doing that. We expect probably somewhere around a 20% head-on price for us on this product in the year. So, in line with the expectations, Mike. Thanks, Louise. We are really excited for a number of the growth drivers that we saw this year, which we really think will continue into next year. I think our strength in parasiticide, our strength in derm, I mean, that will be a billion dollars this year growing at 26% in the quarter. Diagnostics, again, year-to-date, 28%, we think continues into next year, really strong performance in our emerging markets. China, Brazil, and other emerging, which I think will continue into next year, not to mention our pain monoclonal antibodies. So, I think we have a lot of the growth drivers this year that we think will continue into next year.  I mean, obviously things we're going to watch for next year, there could be headwinds for us. Could be the timing of competition for potential product against Apoquel or Simparica Trio, as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, we're not really expecting that until the second half of 2022. Again, we don't have great visibility into that. Obviously, we think [Indiscernible], once we lap some of this draft and impact that will lessen as a real headwind for us. But overall, we really think that durable growth drivers you saw this year really continue into next year and we're pretty confident about that. Sure. I'll take the first part of the question then I will let Wetteny take the second half, Jon. Livestock is a complex picture. So, I think your insight is quite well-founded. In the sense of not just the difference between US and international, but the difference between the specie. So, as you rightly mentioned, the US was down significantly in livestock and that's pretty much generic competition against DRAXXIN, Zoamix and some other products that we mentioned before. But to your point, international was up 7% and that was still with a really rough time in China as you saw in the quarter with China livestock down about 10%, but more than made up for by China's Companion Animal.  And really it has to do with the mix between species that are growing quite quickly for us like fish, cattle, and poultry, maybe struggling but you look at strong growth in emerging markets, which is what's really booing livestock. And as we've said in previous quarters, how US livestock goes does not mean how overall lifestyle goes. So, I think we really, the diversity of our portfolio across species, across geographies continues to really be one of the strengths for us at least. And we do think overall you'll see a flat to low single-digit growth overall across the Company for us in livestock, that maybe a little bit slower than the market, as we said, because of DRAXXIN and some of the key LOEs that we have.  And ultimately, once we lap some of those LOEs, we think you do go back in '23, '24 to a mid-single-digit exactly where we've always been. So, the historic growth of livestock is around 4%. And as we said, we think it absolutely returns there. And what's the reason to believe? Well, if we're growing international in the quarter at 7%, and really the US is mostly getting hit by the generic. Once we lap those, we do believe you can get back to a livestock growth in the sort of mid-single digits, the way it historically has been. But I'll Wetteny take your second question. Solensia. No worries. And I'll take the second half of your question, Erin, with regards to US Companion Animal trends. We don't have the monthly data, but just putting some of this in context, we believe that we look at the data overall right now. We're seeing overall vet clinic revenue growing 7%, which is higher than the historical rate. It's been a little bumpy over the year. I mean, weather, lots of different dynamics have been driving it. You saw 8% in Q1, 14% in Q2., we are seeing 7%. The way we sort of see this is, we think it overall will be higher than historical norms. Is it -- is the double-digit that you saw consistently in 2020?  No, but I don't think -- we saw very weak as you saw in Q1 and there's a huge bounce back in the second half as we saw last year, we do think that revenue at that clinic will continue to grow above historical rates. We're not really sure, as I said last quarter that we think that's going to be double-digit, but historically it grew 5 to 6. Is it going to be 7 to 8? I think our view is it will still be stronger than normal, but maybe not in the double-digits overall. But I mean, its still seeing strength, if you -- anyone of you who have been trying to get an appointment for your dog or your cat at the vet, it's pretty challenging to get one. So mostly because the demand really does remain high there. Sure, thanks Chris. Yes, I mean, our derm portfolio has continued to grow and I think what we've really discovered is there still a large number of untreated animals out there. So, if you look at, we still believe there are 7,000,000 dogs that are diagnosed with some form of itchiness that are still not being treated. We do believe there's significant market growth. There's still geographic expansion. We've really invested heavily in direct-to-consumer advertising to grow this market. People are home more with their pets.  They're spending more time. So, I think people are really starting to notices itch and bothering them more maybe than it did historically. So, they are seeking help. We've also really invested in programs such as in the US are Petcare rewards program, which it making customers loyal to our product. So, we have been expecting competition to be frank. We probably thought it would've happened before now, but we think there's lots of rooms to continue to grow this market. And so, will it remain at 26% of you saw in the quarter? Our growth might go down a little bit, but I still think this will be a growing market for us, just given the large number of untreated dogs in the US and around the globe. The only thing that I could add to that, is we obviously have launched Apoquel there. It is doing well, it is growing. This is a specialty product in a market that's traditionally been mostly a primary care generalist market. So, we're really excited to grow that. And I think we have a very strong pipeline of products coming into China and new innovation that we're going to be bringing in just like we brought in Apoquel, the approval right now for Cytopoint, which has not yet launched there. And honestly lots of products behind that we're really excited to be launching in China. So, we -- it is our second largest market. We do think it's going to continue to have very strong growth. As Wetteny said, with our year-to-date at 35%, we're really bullish on our ability to continue to grow in China. Sure. Again, I can start there. We are really pleased with Librela and yes, we are seeing animals return. I don't have the specific number of days that they're coming back. We can certainly look into that and see if we can get that data for you. It is priced at a premium to both Rimadyl, as well as to Gala plans on the market, so given it has a phenomenal, both safety and efficacy profile, it has been priced at a premium. The price obviously varies from market-to-market, so I don't think we have that overall information. With regards to the second part of your answer on Solensia, half is it quite different markets.  So, although today the market in dogs is 400 and we believe we can double it. The market is actually pretty higher to size in cats. There are very few approved products out there today to treat cats, so I hardly even say what it is. It's not zero, maybe tens of millions, it's certainly not hundreds of millions of dollars. And cats are less medicalized than dogs. So, you really have to first medicalize those cats. You have to be able to -- cats like to hide their pain. So, you also have to find a way that pet owners can notice pain in cats better and identify it and bring them to the vet.  So, the reason we've said it's a smaller market is, the number of cats that are medicalized are just smaller, and then the number that are actually treated is really small. So, the first thing is you need to be able to identify [Indiscernible] with pet owners, convince them to take their cats to the vet and build a market from scratch. Cat owners, when they used to call the vet when their cat was severing from pain, from osteoarthritis. We're told it really wasn't anything. There's no product in the US, for example, whatsoever.  So, it's really about retraining pet owners that there is a product that can meet their cat sneeze, and helping vets really bring the cat into the vet. A lot of pet owners don't like putting their cats in crates to bring them to the vet as you probably know. But we're very confident that we have a strong pipeline for cats that will increasingly medicalized cats' overtime and helped build this market. But as we said, just given the number of medicalized cats will be a smaller market than the dog space. And it will likely take a little longer to build it. Sure. I'll start with your question with regards to the investigation and then Wetteny can take the second half of your question on Companion Animal. On the [Indiscernible] inspection pertains to the [Indiscernible] decision to discontinue the clinical development of a single experimental drug candidate. We're working with the EC to ensure it has all the necessary information that it needs. And we are confident that we can align the concerns which are prompted the investigation. So, I think your second part of the question was on Companion Animal trends. The 7% which was broken up between 3% on traffic and 4% on spend per visit, but I don't know Wetteny if you've got any comments on that? Sure. I wish we knew exactly. I mean, we had the same theories that you do that there could be certain technical reasons for some competitors. And let me be clear. Everyone's working in this space. This is the parasiticides. It's the largest single market in Animal Health at $5 billion. So, I think if you're pretty much any of the large companies we compete with, they're all trying to come up with their own triple combination. So, I don't know that it's the same thing that's holding each of the companies back.  I mean, we're not really clear. It definitely could be regulatory, it could be technical, it could be manufacturing CMC. We're not exactly clear. And to your point, there's really very few public companies who actually disclose much about their pipeline. So, our ability to know where people are is quite limited. We just -- and we always -- I know it's a little [Indiscernible] keep pushing it out. Sort of like 6 to 12 months from whenever you ask the question because we haven't seen it and we haven't heard it in corporate accounts and they're negotiating with us, we think it's definitely another 3 -- every quarterly with another 3 plus months out. And that's really where some of our back comes from.  And yes, we are confident that even if you'll see, we are planning on competition in these key products, but I think that it's the strength and diversity of our pipeline globally that makes us confident we can continue to grow above market. We've got diagnostics, we've got pain mAb. We still think you're going to be growing in [Indiscernible] to be honest with you, it's still a lot of unmet medical needs, so yes, we remain confident that we can grow above the market even if we do start to face competition in some of these key franchises. Sure. DRAXXIN KP was part of our defense strategy. I don't think it's going to restart growth for us necessarily to market as we're seeing generic competition, but it is as Wetteny outlined in his remarks at the beginning of this call. It's helped us retain our share. It provides incremental innovation and incremental benefit to our customers and a reason, obviously, to stay with that. Yes, we have had in the US two competitor s so far. We've heard up to three more are potentially coming. I don't know why they haven't -- we would've expected them this year, so their approval -- whether or not they actually entered the market, we're not really --we not sure when and if on that, but we would've said we probably have a few more entering. Great. Look, thank you everyone for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, I think we delivered another strong quarter of results driven by our diverse global portfolio and strength in Petcare parasiticides and dermatology products. We are raising our guidance for the full-year 2021 and we remain on track for a record-setting year for us. And we're continuing to invest in the areas to support our long-term growth. And we remain confident in the fundamental growth drivers for animal health and for Zoetis into 2022 and beyond. So, thanks so much for joining us today. Have a great day."

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin and good morning, everyone. The focus of my comments today will be on our third quarter financial results, the contributing factors that drove our performance and an update of our improved full-year 2021 guidance. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 11% on a reported basis, and 10% operationally. Adjusted net income of $597 million was an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 10% operationally. Operationally revenue grew 10% with 2% from price and 8% from volume. Run growth is comprised of 5% from new products, including Simparica Trio, and 3% from our online portfolio, primarily our key dermatology franchise. Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter.  Companion Animal products again led the way in terms of species growth, growing 19% operationally, with livestock declining 2% operationally in the quarter. Our parasiticide portfolio made the largest contribution to Companion Animal growth driven by sales of Simparica Trio and continues strength across our broader portfolio including the Proheart franchise, Simparica, and Revolution Stronghold Plus. We also saw robust growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Simparica Trio had another exceptional quarter posting revenue of $122 million, representing operational growth of 140% versus the comparable 2020 period, with year-to-date sales of $350 million.  We believe the global fleet second hardware market will continue to expand and that our broad and innovative portfolio, which were 32% operationally in the quarter has us well-positioned to capture share and outpace our competitors. Global sales of our key dermatology products were $321 million in the quarter, growing 26% operationally. Total sales exceeded $300 million for the first time in Company history. And we remain ahead of schedule to surpass $1 billion in dermatology sales for the year. Our diagnostics portfolio had operational sales growth of 7% in Q3 against a very challenging comparative period as the third quarter of 2020 had a sharp increase in wellness visits following wide fill clinic closures in the second quarter.  Our International Diagnostics portfolio performed very well, which as Kristin mentioned, was a key component for the strategic rationale of the Abaxis acquisition. Diagnostics remains the key growth driver for Zoetis, and we will continue to make significant investments in new technology, expand our reference [Indiscernible] footprint, as well as provide flexible solutions to our customers. Our equine products delivered strong results with operational sales growth of 20% in the quarter as horse shows and racing return to pre-pandemic levels and field growth in vaccines, as well as nutritional and pain products.  The expected decline in livestock in the quarter was primarily driven by our US cattle and US poultry businesses as our international segment delivered operational growth across all species. Globally, our cattle business declined 5% operationally in the quarter driven by the impact of generic competition for DRAXXIN and a difficult comparative quarter resulting from COVID-19 dynamics and earlier fall cattle run in the US in the third quarter of 2020. Poultry also declined in the quarter as producers in the US rotated to lower-cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of current market dynamics. Sales were also negatively impacted by generic competition of Zoamix and BMD, our alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives.  The decline in cattle and poultry offset the growth in fish. Swine was essentially flat in the quarter as decline in the US, primarily from pricing pressure on our anti-infective and vaccine portfolio as a result of generic competition, offset the growth internationally from further key account expansion. Overall, we delivered another strong quarter, bench marked against a very difficult prior-year comparative period on both the Companion Animal and livestock sides of our business. Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue growth of 7%. Sales of Companion Animal products grew 17%, and lifestyle product sales declined by 13%.  For Companion Animal, Petcare trends continued to be robust. Vet clinic revenue and patient visits grew again this quarter against growth rates from the third quarter of last year, which were well above historical levels. Our view remains unchanged that certain trends will moderate, but we remain above pre-pandemic levels. Growth in US Companion Animal was led by our parasiticides portfolio and our key dermatology products. Simparica Trio continues to perform well, with US sales of $110 million and year-to-date sales north of $300 million.  This quarter is also an excellent representation of our commitment to invest in the broader parasiticide portfolio as we launched the targeted DTC campaign for Proheart and prevalent heartworm geographies. Key dermatology sales were $270 million in the US for the quarter, growing 20% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. US diagnostic sales grew 2% in the quarter, which as I mentioned earlier had a very difficult comparative period. However, year-to-date performance has been strong at 23% growth. US livestock sales declined 13% in the quarter.  Our US cattle business faced the comparative period that's a robust growth at third quarter performance of 2020 benefited from an early for cattle run and pent-up demand work its way through the system. In addition, generic competition had not entered the market in the third quarter of 2020. Our generic defense strategy has been successful as we have been able to maintain a greater volume share of the [Indiscernible] market than originally expected. Although additional generics will likely enter the market in the coming quarters. From an end market perspective, producer profitability remains challenged by input costs, primarily feed and labor.  US poultry sales declined in the quarter as smaller flocks resulted in lower disease pressure, allowing producers to expand usage of lower-cost alternatives through our highly efficacious premium products. In addition, generic competition is creating pricing pressure on our Zoamix NBNT franchises. To summarize, our US operations delivered another strong quarter driven by our innovative and robust Companion Animal products along with petcare and markets, displaying very strong fundamentals. The near-term weakness in our US livestock business has been expected and has been more than offset by the strengthened Companion Animal, which demonstrate the importance of diversification across species.  Now, turning to our international segment. Revenue of our International segment grew 14% operational in the quarter with Companion Animal revenue growing 24%, and livestock revenue growing 7% operationally. In the second half of 2020, we saw a material uptick in medicalization rates and standard of care by pet owners, a trend which has continued through the third quarter of this year. We entered and made significant investments in advertising promotion to capitalize on favorable market conditions and drive growth. Companion Animal achieved broad-based growth internationally in the quarter, led by strong performance of our key dermatology products.  Through 3 quarters of 2021, year-to-date sales are in excess of total sales on the entire prior year. In addition, we are in the early stages of a DTC campaign for key dermatology, which we expect will create additional demand for our products. Paracitisides had a strong quarter internationally, led by significant growth in the Simparica franchise, which benefited from DTC campaigns and drove growth in Brazil, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Librela our monoclonal antibody for alleviation of [Indiscernible] pain in dogs, has done extremely well, generating $15 million in quarterly sales in a select number of markets.  Feedback from veterinarians and pet owners on the quality-of-life improvement for the patients has been extremely encouraging. Our feline monoclonal antibody for alleviation of [Indiscernible] pain Solensia, had positive feedback from the early experience programs in Q2 and launched in the EU this quarter. [Indiscernible] in cats is a significant unmet need in animal health and our view is that Solensia will become a blockbuster product, with the pain market for cats becoming approximately a $200 million global category overtime. Our international diagnostics portfolio grew 20% operationally in the quarter, with significant growth in consumable and instrument revenue. And strong growth across a number of geographies such as the UK, Australia, China, and various other markets.  Moving onto livestock, our international business again delivered growth across all species, led by strong operational growth in cattle and fish. Cattle growth in the quarter was driven by further key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil, in several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 21% operationally. Growth in our fish portfolio was primarily the result of increased sales of our Alpha Flux Sea lice treatment product, as well as strong growth in vaccines. Performance in swine and poultry were also fueled by growth in key accounts, as well as overall market growth, primarily emerging markets.  At a market level view for international segment, all major markets grew operational in the third quarter with the exception of France, which was essentially flat in Q3. Emerging markets was again a key contributor to our international performance, led by Brazil, which was 22% on an operational basis. As we expected, growth in China slowed in the third quarter as lower pork prices challenged with this or profitability. However, the Companion Animal business in China, which grew double-digits once again, offset the weakness in swine. Overall, total emerging markets has grown significantly in both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Our international segment again delivered strong results of robust growth in Companion Animal and growth across all species in livestock.  On a year-to-date basis, our international segment has grown 20% operationally with our Companion Animal and livestock businesses, each growing double-digits. While following pork prices in China are creating a headwind that is moderating growth in swine, it is more than offset by the growth across other species and markets for the demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography.  Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.7% increased 110 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as favorable product mix for an exchange, low inventory charges and price were partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, freight and distribution costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 19% operationally, with SG&A expenses growing 20% operationally resulting from increased compensation-related costs, as well as increased advertising and promotion expense, freight, and T&E. Our [Indiscernible] expenses were 17% operationally driven by higher project spend.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.7%, a decrease of 330 basis points due to favorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings including increased favorability related to foreign derived and tangible income, and an increase in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable third quarter. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower effective tax rate.  Our liquidity position remains very healthy. And in the third quarter were $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents following a $600 million repayment of long-term debt in August. Our financial flexibilities in a very strong position, which allows us to make meaningful investments in our business while returning excess cash to shareholders, as demonstrated by our repurchase of Zoetis shares of approximately $200 million in the quarter. Now, moving on to our updated guidance for 2021 through a raising and narrowing as a result of our performance in the third quarter and confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable future growth. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-October.  For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range with projected revenue now between $7.7 billion and.$7.75 billion and operational revenue growth between 14% and 14.5% for the full-year versus the 12.5% to 13.5% in our August guidance. Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.91 billion and $1.94 billion versus $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion in our prior guidance.  The guidance rate largely represents additional compensation-related costs, as well as increased advertising and promotion spend to support growth of new products and key franchises. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.2 billion and $2.225 billion, representing operational growth of 16.5% to 18% compared to our prior guidance of 13% to 15%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.62 to $4.67, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.23 to $4.29. Now, to summarize, before we move to Q&A.  Three quarters, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom-line growth with revenue growing 17% operationally. And again, raised and narrowed our full-year 2021 guidance. We have achieved significant growth across our key franchises and are extremely excited about our new product launches, and product pipeline. Now, I hand things over to our operator to open the line for your questions. Operator. Yes. Thank you. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter and position to raise a guidance once again for the year. With respect to DRAXXIN, as expected, we continue to see the effect of the LOE and DRAXXIN was down about $15 million in the quarter. Now, our defense strategy here is working well and we are largely maintaining our market share although that does have the effect on price. So, we're very pleased with how the product is performing as well as DRAXXIN KP in terms of maintaining largely the market share from a volume perspective here. As we look forward, we are expecting further generic competitors to come into this space from a DRAXXIN perspective, and that we believe will continue into next year as well. Yes. Sure. Look, we continue to see really strong underlying market dynamics overall. And our portfolio is really well-positioned and continues to perform very well against those dynamics. As we discussed on the prior earnings call, what we're seeing in terms of growth rates in the second half of this year is more reflection of how the phasing occurred last year versus this year, given our position in the market. Again, the strong market dynamics that we continue to face here. If you look at last year, the second half had almost 17% more revenue in the back half in the first half of last year.  And so that's really what's driving the comp here. Those are the phasing of last year where this year is a little bit more normalized. As Kristin just referenced, we see a number of growth drivers for us, not only from the overall market, but also our portfolio across [Indiscernible], as we look at pain, diagnostics as well, with the one area -- the area that we're watching, including DRAXXIN. To your point around inflation, is you know given our portfolio and innovative products that we have and demand we see for those products, they position us well to take price. And you saw a 2% price in the quarter included in 10% operational growth.  And we'll continue to look at opportunities to continue to do that as we go into next year, you saw in the quarter our gross margins actually expanded by 110 basis points versus last year Q3, and so that despite some headwinds in the areas of freight, etc. So, we'll continue to monitor those and take price where we can give the innovative products that we bring to the market [Indiscernible] Yes. As we've discussed just before here, we're well-positioned, going out of this year into next year, to continue to sustain growth beyond this year. In terms of how you might see things flow through the P&L, our long-term value proposition is to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. We don't see any reason to depart from that. However, given the opposition across a number of really key brands and demand that we see, we'll take the opportunity to invest behind those brands to drive DTC by other awareness campaigns, etc. We're also are investing in R&D, as well as Diagnostics and other areas that we believe will help us accelerate and enhance growth going forward. So that may, at times, cause that difference to be a little bit tighter as you said, from time to time, but it's to drive that growth -- that enhanced level of growth that we see, given the opportunity that we see in the market. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Librela and Solensia in the European markets where we've launched the product. The feedback has been very, very strong from vet and pet owners as well. We saw $50 million of revenue from Librela in the quarter and about $2 million from Solensia. Again, really the first full quarter of those products being in those select markets for us. In terms of where we're expecting approval for next year and we continue to expect approval for Librela as Kristin mentioned, in the first half of the year. I'm sorry. Solensia in the first half. Sorry about that. Solensia in the first half. With Librela, more likely in the second half of the year in the US. Yeah, I'll start and see what Kristin what's to add here with respect to China. As expected, we saw growth decelerate in China this quarter with about 1% growth in the quarter but keep in mind, China has actually grown 35% on a year-to-date basis. We're up against a very solid comparative on last year where we saw 63% growth in the quarter. And swine was actually up 159% in the same quarter last year. Again, the pricing dynamics [Indiscernible] which we discussed on the last call started about mid-June.  And so, we expected to see sort of decline in the pork area. Now, the other part of your question is long-term. What do we expect in the market? We do see continued opportunity to grow substantially in China over time as we bring more and more robotics to the market. But also, if you look at what's happened since African swine fever, you see a concentration more on larger producers versus backyard forms, and we think that [Indiscernible] well in terms of whole medicalization over time, as well for our premium products with respect to swine.  And then on the Companion Animal side, we continue to see really robust growth in China. In Companion Animal, we saw double-digit growth this quarter. And Companion Animal which obviously was partly offset by the swine. So long term, we continue to expect really solid growth in China, which is our second largest market, driven by the market dynamics that we discussed. Although there may be cycles that we'll see in swine as we're going through right now from a pricing standpoint. Sure. Look, we saw another strong quarter across our parasiticide franchise. Small animal parasiticide grew about 32% in the quarter with $391 billion. We've had Trio sales of $122 million, $350 million so far through this year on a year-to-date basis. The part that continues to do extremely well, particularly in our large corporate accounts, where the penetration rates about 90% and we're seeing about 80% of the order rates as well. So, we continue to gain share in this very large market.  If you recall, last year we launched the product, and so we've now -- without lapping it. And in terms of parasiticides, a sort of seasonality starts to play into [Indiscernible] in terms of what you might see as well. So, this is really in line with our expectations and we couldn't be more pleased with how the product is doing in the market. And now that we've really penetrated well with the large corporate accounts, we're now going into some of the mid-size accounts as well. So, we continue to see the product gain momentum and again, in line with our expectations. Yeah, sure. As Kristin mentioned, we saw 7% revenue growth for vet with about -- with visits up 3% and a revenue per visit up about 4%. And that's up against a prior year where we saw real increase in the third quarter in terms of vet visits, etc., given the effects of the pandemic. We continue to expect that these statistics will continue to be above pre-pandemic levels, or they would moderate from their peaks. Other -- two other important points to recall here is that if you look at pet ownership or more, we're seeing millennials and Gen-Z bring pets into their homes, and they are doing a lot more research and looking at petcare and wellness, and they are willing to spend more on their pets. So, the increase in pet ownership, we expect that to continue to provide really strong tailwind in the industry for spending on pets as we look forward and as those pets continue to age as well."

Hosting the call today is, Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] And it\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2021 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and by Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, August 5, 2021. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and getting vaccinated for COVID-19.  I\u2019d like to start the call by welcoming our new Chief Financial Officer, Wetteny Joseph, who is joining me on the call today. As the former CFO of Catalent, Wetteny is a veteran of the biopharma industry and very familiar with many of you in the investment community. Wetteny joined us on June 1 and is off to a fast start learning all about the company and animal health, everything from cattle guarding and drive impacts to pet care trends and parasiticide season.  I am confident that Wetteny will make strong contribution to our ongoing market performance, value creation and leadership in animal health. I also want to take a moment to thank Glenn David for his partnership and all of his contributions to Zoetis as CFO over the last five years. Glenn has taken on a new role overseeing our international operations, and other business units including PHARMAQ, BioDevices, and Pumpkin Pet Insurance.  I know he will bring his signature leadership qualities, business skills and industry knowledge to this role and continue driving profitable growth in these areas.  Now turning to the second quarter, we achieved strong results once again with 22% operational growth in revenue and 28% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our companion animal portfolio generated 36% operational revenue growth, driven by our pet care parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and diagnostics.  Meanwhile, livestock product sales were up 3% operationally and remain in line with our expectations for more moderate growth this year. The second quarter results also reflected favorable comparisons to last year's second quarter, when the uncertainty of COVID-19 and related lockdowns were more severely felt across the animal health industry.  We are raising full year guidance for revenue and adjusted net income again this quarter to reflect our first half performance and confidence in the underlying growth drivers of our business. We remain on track for a very strong year and continue to focus on sustaining our investment in long-term growth opportunities.  With the strong cash flow and positive outlook, we are investing internally and externally in innovative new products, market expansion plans, and direct-to-consumer promotions that will support future growth. Our team has been delivering strong growth, based on internally developed companion animal, parasiticides, led by our Simparica, PROHEART Revolution Plus franchises. We\u2019ve redefined care for the dermatology category with our development of Apoquel and Cytopoint, and we see more growth potential coming from our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, new vector vaccines for poultry, and the industry's first cloud-based diagnostic platform with AI capabilities.  In terms of our monoclonal antibodies for of alleviation of OA pain in dogs and cats, we continue to anticipate U. S. approval for Librela and Solensia in 2022.  Meanwhile, initial customer response from vet and pet owners in Europe has been excellent and we recently received approval of Solensia in Canada. I always say, with great pride, that we have the best field force in the animal health industry and we will continue to expand the scope, effectiveness and digital tools in ways that can enhance our customers\u2019 experience and support our growth objectives.  We've also seen a positive return on our investments in direct-to-consumer promotions for Simparica Apoquel, and disease awareness over the years. And DTC remains an area of ongoing investment to support our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios.  And finally, we continue to look externally for business development opportunities that can complement our portfolio and expand our market presence or capabilities. Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire Jurox, a privately held animal health company based in Australia expected to close in the first half of 2022.  The acquisition will provide us with growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity, and increased capabilities in Australia, our fifth largest market. And also bring us a range of companion animal and life livestock products primed for global expansion.  As I wrap up my remarks, our growth story for this year remains very consistent based on three recurring catalysts. First, our companion animal portfolio, driven by our triple combination Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our dermatology treatments, Apoquel and Cytopoint, new monoclonal antibodies for pain and our Vet Scan diagnostic systems.  The entire portfolio is benefiting from strong pet care trends in terms of increasing clinic visits, rising spend per visit and a focus on diagnostics and specialty care, especially among newer and younger generations of head owners.  Recent estimates for market growth in companion and animal products are in the high-single-digits and Zoetis continues to expect to grow faster than the market. We are gaining share in the approximately $5 billion global parasiticides market for pets, and we excited by veterinarian and pet owner responses to our new monoclonal antibodies for pain.  We also continue to see progress in the early launch of VetScan Imagyst, which leads to our second catalyst for growth, diagnostics, which posted 38% operational revenue growth in the second quarter and access to vet clinics in the U. S. rebounded from the year ago quarter.  Our third growth catalyst is international, where we continued to generate strong operational growth, driven by China and Brazil, which grew at 30% and 40% respectively.  All our catalysts for growth are buoyed by our priority to Champion, a healthier and more sustainable future, the commitments to our communities, animals, and the planet. You can read more about our progress on these ESG goals and our first Sustainability Report, which is published in June.  In closing, we had a great second quarter and we're focused on delivering our record-setting year. The market dynamics in animal health remains strong, steady and resilient, even during the challenging times, based on people's unbreakable bond with animals.  For the remainder of the year, our diverse portfolio, innovative pet care products, strengthen in diagnostics, and expansion in international markets will continue driving our performance.  Now, let me hand things off to Wetteny. \nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter performance, I would like to take a moment to express how excited I to join Zoetis, a company with an exceptional opportunity for meaningful for long-term growth, driven by the durability and resiliency of the existing portfolio, a robust product pipeline and a key focus on future innovation.  I look forward to leading an outstanding finance organization and maintaining the financial principles and investment strategies, which position Zoetis as the world leader in animal health. I would also like to express my appreciation to the Zoetis colleagues and the investment community for such a warm and gracious welcome.  I had the pleasure of speaking with several of our investors since becoming CFO and I look forward to connecting with many more in the coming weeks.  Now shifting the focus to earnings. This morning, I will provide commentary on our second quarter financial results, the key contributing factors to our performance and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 26% on a reported basis and 22% operational.  Adjusted net income of $566 million was an increase of 33% on a reported basis and 28% operationally. Operational revenue grew 22% with 2% from price and 20% from volume. Volume growth includes 12% from other in line products, 6% from new products and 2% from key dermatology products.  We delivered another strong quarter and remain encouraged by the performance of our business, health of the overall industry and our outlook for the future. It is worth noting that Q2 2020 is a favorable comparative period due to the impact of COVID-19.  The pandemic caused widespread uncertainty last year, which led to clinic closures, supply chain disruptions, and shifts in consumer demand from restaurant and foodservice to grocery stores. This materially impacted several aspects of our companion animal and livestock businesses.  Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 36% operationally with livestock growing 3% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was again driven by our parasiticides portfolio, led by sales of Simparica Trio and with significant contributions from the broader portfolio.  We also continue to see growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in vaccines and diagnostics.  Simparica Trio had continued to perform exceptionally well, posting revenue of $139 million, representing growth of more than 200% versus the comparable 2020 period. In addition to sales, we are exceeding our other performance measures as well, such as clinic penetration, share within penetrated clinics and reordering rates.  The strength of our entire companion animal parasiticides portfolio was evident again this quarter growing 50% operationally with meaningful growth in the ProHeart and Revolution strong growth franchises in addition to the Simparica franchise. Having the broadest and most innovative portfolio within a larger and expanding therapeutic area is as bullish on future growth in parasiticides.  Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio was $280 million in the quarter, growing 22% operationally. Cytopoint had an particularly strong quarter, growing 42% operationally and generating quarterly revenue of $100 million for the first time since launch. Year-to-date sales for key dermatology products of $524 million in our view remains unchanged that sales will exceed $1 billion this year.  Our diagnostics portfolio had operational growth of 38% in Q2, led by increases in consumable and estimate revenue as the business continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic. With our sustained investments in diagnostics, the newest technology we are bringing to the market and the ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio, we are well-positioned to grow faster than the diagnostics market, which is expected to grow double-digits and outpace the overall animal health markets.  Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Cattle grew 3% and swine grew 6% operationally, despite price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs, weighing on producer profitability in the U. S. Data suggests the foodservice service and restaurant industries continued to recover in the second quarter, which is a crucial dynamic for demand of our premium products.  Poultry was the only species to decline in the quarter, which fell 4% as producers in the U. S. expanded their use of lower cost alternatives to our products. The decline in poultry partially offset the growth in cattle, swine and fish products.  Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 22% with sales of companion animal products growing 34% and livestock product sales declining 8%. U.S. quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in company history.  For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain robust. Placement revenue increased double-digits in the quarter and patient visits and spend per visit were up as well. While we expect some of the trends to moderate, our view is we will remain above pre-COVID-19 levels.  In addition, a meaningful portion of pet acquisitions, which occurred during the pandemic were by millennial and GenZ. This infuses a solid foundation of younger pet ownership, who are willing to spend disproportionately more on all aspects of pet than prior generations and will be a key growth driver for companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics moving forward.  Our companion animal parasiticides portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth in the U.S. growing 59% in the quarter. Key hematology products, vaccines and diagnostics also contributed to growth.  Simparica Trio had an incredibly strong quarter in the U.S. with sales of $120 million generating the highest revenue by a single product in the U.S. for Q2. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $153 million, growing 96% and remained the number two brand in the U.S. flea tick and heartworm markets.  Key dermatology sales were $197 million for the quarter, growing 23% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Diagnostics sales increased 22% in the quarter with growth in instruments, rapid, test, point-of-care consumables and reference lab revenue.  U.S. livestock sales fell 8% in the quarter, driven by declines in cattle and poultry with swine essentially flat for the quarter. Q2 cattle sales were negatively impacted by a promotional program in the first quarter of this year, which pulled forward a portion of second quarter sales.  In addition, price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs weighing on beef and dairy end-markets, presented challenges to our cattle business this quarter. Poultry declined in the quarter, as produces expanded use of lower cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of higher feed cost and labor wages and smaller flux sizes reducing disease pressure. We also face generic competition for Zoamix, our alternative to antibiotics in medicated feed additives.  To summarize, our U.S. operations delivered another strong quarter, led by our innovative and robust companion animal portfolio. The end-market dynamics for companion animal remain extremely healthy with pet ownership and pet spending trends driving an environment conducive to sustainable future growth, which is expected to more than offset the near-term weaknesses in our U.S. livestock business.  Now turning to our international segment. Revenue in our international segment also grew 22% operationally in the quarter with companion animal revenue growing 41% and livestock revenue growing 10% operationally. The trends fueling strength in our international companion animal business are very similar to those in the U.S.  The increasing medicalization rates and standard of care by pet owners, coupled with significant investments in advertising and promotion to support new product launches and key brands drove growth across our parasiticides, vaccines, diagnostics, and key dermatology portfolios.  Diagnostics were one 106% operationally in the quarter, with consumables and instrument revenue, each exceeding 100% operational growth.  Librela, our monoclonal antibody for of alleviation of OA pain in dogs launched in the EU in the second quarter. Feedback from the early experience trials in Q1 was encouraging and second quarter sales exceeded our expectations further supporting our optimism on the long-term blockbuster potential of the product, as well as monoclonal antibodies as a platform for future growth.  Our feline line monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain Solensia began early experience programs in the second quarter with an EU launch following in Q3. As previously mentioned, OA pain in cats is a significant unmet need in animal health and we're excited to provide pet owners with a novel product in a space that has previously lacked innovation.  Meanwhile, our international livestock business had its second consecutive quarter with growth across all species led by strong operational growth in cattle and swine. Cattle growth in the quarter was driven by marketing campaigns, key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets.  Revenue growth in swine is largely attributed to China, which grew 38% operationally. The theme for growth in swine remain consistent with previous quarters has large key accounts increased their use of our vaccines and other products as they continued to expand production as the market shifts from smaller farms to larger scale modern operations.  Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% operationally. Growth was driven by strong performance of Alpha Flux in Chile, vaccine volume in Norway and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. From a market perspective lens, all major markets grew double-digits in the second quarter with the exception of Japan, which declined slightly in Q2.  China and Brazil had strong quarters, growing 30% and 40% respectively on an operational basis. Growth in companion animal across emerging markets remains a key driver of our international business and in addition to the growth in China and Brazil, our other emerging markets companion animal business grew 68% operationally.  Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography. The livestock business continues to perform well and increasing pet acquisitions and pet care spending are extremely encouraging trends for long-term growth in companion animal.  Now moving onto to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margins of 71% is essentially flat on a reported basis, compared to the prior year, as favorable product mix and price were offset by higher manufacturing cost and freight.  Adjusted operating expenses increased 23% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs, advertising and promotion expense and freight.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, a decrease of 230 basis points, driven by the favorable impact of a jurisdictional mix of earnings, lower GILTI tax and an increase in favorable discrete items, compared to the prior year's comparable quarter.  Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth.  We remain in a very strong liquidity position and continued our share buyback program, repurchasing approximately $165 million worth of shares in the quarter. The strength of our balance sheet and substantial free cash flow generation allows us to make significant investments for future growth, while still returning excess cash to shareholders.  Before I review our updated guidance, I would like to reiterate a point that has been discussed on prior earnings calls, which is that, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of varying comparative periods, where pent-up demand created by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half of the year in addition to the expected increased generic competition for DRAXXIN.  Adjusting for the variability in the comparative period due to the pandemic, our phasing of top-line growth would be more normalized and consistent quarter-to-quarter throughout this year.  Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising and narrowing as a result of our second quarter performance, strength of our product portfolio, and favorable market dynamics, which we expect to continue in the second half. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July.  For revenue, we are raising and narrowing in our guidance range. We\u2019ve projected revenue now between $7.625 billion and $7.7 billion and operational revenue growth between 12.5% and 13.5% for the full year versus the 10.5% to 12% in our May guidance.  Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion, versus $1.82 billion and $1.87 billion in our prior guidance. The increased spend represents additional advertising and promotion investments, a significant portion of which will occur in the third quarter, as well as compensation-related cost due to the company performance.  Adjusted net income is now expected be in the range of $2.135 billion and $2.175 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%, compared to our prior guidance of 12% to 14%.  Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.47 to $4.55 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.19.  Now to summarize before we move on to Q&A. Our strong performance in the first half of 2021 continues to underscore the value of our diversity, innovation and durable business model. We again raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance and expect to grow faster than the markets. We continue to focus on long-term sustainable growth by investing in our pipeline, including infrastructure to support current and future product launches and remain very positive in our outlook for sustainable growth beyond this year.  Now I\u2019ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  And we will take our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. \nMichael Ryskin : Thanks for taking the question, as always I will congrats on another strong quarter. I want to start with Simparica Trio, just a really break out quarter with $139 million. I mean, by our projections, something in the $450,000 to $500,000 range, has been out of the picture for the rest of the year. So I just want to get better a sense of where you're seeing an incremental growth coming from? I mean, we did note a little bit of a tick down in regular Simparica in the U.S. year-over-year.  So just wondering if you could kind of little again on cannibalization just revenue expectations as you move forward?  And then, my second question will be on the operating leverage. I was wondering we\u2019ve talked about in the past, but definitely saw a notable step up sequentially in SG&A coming in somewhat above my estimates. You mentioned a lot of the advertising spend, a lot of compensation-related expenses. Could just give us a sense of how much this is expected to persist going forward?  Obviously, it\u2019s going to play a big role in the operating leverage in the second half of the year and given some of the comps, I want to get a better sense of what goes into that $490 million and sort of how to think about that? \nKristin Peck : Great. Thanks, Mike. I'll take the first question and I'll let Wetteny take the second question on the leverage. Yes, Simparica, and Simparica Trio did had a phenomenal quarter. Overall, as Wetteny mentioned, we had 50% growth in parasiticides. But, as you look at the quarter for Trio with the $139 million, it was incredibly strong. And I would say, Trio is and has been outpacing our expectations. In fact, the Simparica franchise in Q2 was the second largest in the flea tick, heartworm space.  So, we're very excited. We expect to continue to see this product grow. The market itself has now grown to over $5 billion. So, we remain super excited. We're doing well both on our penetration of clinics, as well as reorder. So we see strong momentum that we think will continue into the second half of the year. So, I\u2019ll let Wetteny take your second question. \nJoseph Wetteny: Yes, in terms of SG&A, indeed, the step up that you see in terms of our trend there is really largely driven by R&D investments, as well as advertising and promotion behind our strong brands, given momentum that we have in the market and the strong market conditions that we are in. We are really putting advertising behind our key brands  You mentioned Simparica as a franchise, both Trio, particularly in the U.S. and other markets, but also Simparica continues to grow internationally for us and we want to take advantage of the momentum that we have in this very large market, $5 billion plus. And so, we'll continue to do that as we enter into the back half of the year, particularly, in Q3, as we said in the prepared commentary. But that's really largely what\u2019s driving in.  In terms of compensation-related costs, this is really more of a variable low compensation areas that are really in line with the performance of the company there, as well. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. \nJon Block : Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Chris, maybe I'll start on the monoclonal and I know it's early, but how are you seeing Librela being used in these international practices? In other words, is it market expansion? Is it taking share from other solutions or cannibalization or remedial? Any color you have there would be helpful.  And then just to shift gears on livestock, it's always choppy and can move around. But is there anything more structural going on in the U.S. market in regard to generic competition? And maybe on that last point, how is traction playing out? You mentioned that it seems like maybe less impact to-date, but is the overall year assumption still unchanged? Thanks guys. \nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Jon. Good to hear from you. I'll take the first question and I'll let Wetteny take the second question on livestock. We have been very excited at the uptick in Librela. As what we're seeing and your question about how is it really being used. We've seen really strong efficacy of the product. The feedback we've gotten and through early experience in our first quarter of sales is just us really quick efficacy.  So, they are noticing differences pretty quick. It's improving quality of life, better socialability. So we really think more and more vets are looking at this as a first-line therapy. We do think that there are significant opportunities for Librela to grow the category.  The dog categories you've talked about before, currently is $400 million. But we believe by bringing this type of innovation to the market, support them globally, but bringing this type of innovation from the safety and efficacy profile, we think we have the ability to potentially double that market, if you look at how many dogs there are, how many have away and how many are treated.  So, we look at the opportunity to grow this market in a few ways. Certainly, as I talked about getting more animals, getting more days on treatment, and better compliance and then, certainly with price of this product is priced at a premium to those are already in the market. So Wetteny, do you want to take the second question on livestock? \nJoseph Wetteny: Yes, sure. Look, in terms of livestock, we don't see a structural change here in terms of your question and the performance that we're seeing is right in line with our expectations. Livestock grew 3% on the quarter. And as we've said, livestock has tend to grow somewhere around the 4% range in the past but we expect it to be in low-single-digits.  This year, and really the global growth in that area is driven by international markets, particularly when you think about emerging markets like China and Brazil, et cetera, in the U.S. with the generic competition for DRAXXIN, we expected to see some headwind there. And it's really playing out in line with our expectations.  One more point I\u2019ll make is, if you recall, in Q1, we did have some promotions again in line with our generic defense strategy that really accelerated some of our revenue into Q1 from Q2. So that's playing out a little bit in terms of what you're seeing in the livestock figures for the U.S. But we expect to see further declines in terms of livestock for the remainder of the year and all that\u2019s factored into the guidance that we raised today as well. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. \nLouise Chen : Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. Just curious how durable you think this increase in the vet visit, plus spend per pet will be over the longer term? Thank you. \nKristin Peck: Thanks Louise. Great to hear from you. Yes, we're very confident in the durability of the companion animal trends that you've seen throughout 2020 and 2021. So, as you look in the quarter, we saw overall clinic revenues up 14% and that was equally split between vet visits and spend per visit. And our confidence in the fact that these durable trends really have to do with a few things; one, there are more pets. We've talked about that for a number of quarters.  The other thing is, it's going to increase in the standard of care, the expectations of pet owners, greater use across the portfolio, greater use of diagnostics, more people home noticing more about their pets. But the other really important trend that's going to continue to play out is who is adopting a lot more of these pets and that's a lot of millennials and GenZ and they tend of spend more on their pets. They're very engaged in their care. So, we see these as durable trends that will continue, and will remain a big growth driver for the company over the coming years. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. \nJohn Kreger : Hi. Thanks very much. I have a gross margin question. I realize the monoclonals are sort of a new class for you guys as Solensia and Librela ramp, do you expect the gross margin on those products to be better or worse than what you see across your traditional product portfolio? \nJoseph Wetteny: Yes. Look, we certainly - given the safety and efficacy profile of these products, we expect to be priced at a significant premium to existing therapies including on remedial. So, I would say, it would be above sort of our average gross margin that you see across our portfolio. \nJohn Kreger : Great. Thanks, Wetteny. \nJoseph Wetteny: Thanks, John. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Katie Try. Sorry, Katie Tryhane with Credit Suisse. \nKatie Tryhane : Hi. Thanks for my question. You highlighted the strength in diagnostics. Can you just speak about some of the advantages and success that you've had with bundling strategies with therapeutics? And can you speak to what you're seeing in terms of competitive placements for instruments? You also called out the new VetScan Imagyst platform.  I mean, how has that been performing today? And how do you expect that to contribute to growth in the business going forward? Thanks. \nKristin Peck: Thanks, Katie. As you look at diagnostics, it was a very strong quarter with 38% operational growth. Diagnosis, as we've talked about remains a very attractive segment with double-digit growth. And it really - it's core to the way that that practice operates.  Again, pets cannot tell you exactly how they are feeling. So we continue to see this being a really strong part of our continuum of care strategy. It's critical to the best practice. We did incredibly strong growth as you saw in the quarter in international making significant placements, very strong in the U.S. and we're focused on a few things there.  Certainly, it's placements as we talked about where we are seeing good growth there, stronger in the quarter in international than the U.S. but also really driving consumable use. And we think that remains a big opportunity for us versus competition getting more consumable use in the placements that we have. And then, really adding on to the innovation, so, if you look at the images launch, it had done better than our expectations. We continue to see very strong growth there.  Right now, the indication for the VetScan Imagyst is in sequel and that's a large market, it\u2019s about $500 million, growing at 7% to 8%. So, we see really strong growth there. I don\u2019t know, what 8% and adds? \nJoseph Wetteny: Not it\u2019s probably 1%. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. \nDavid Westenberg : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I am going actually continue on that concept. And can you - that was just asked with Katie. Can you help us conceptualize the size of the non-therapeutic revenue for Zoetis on a go-forward basis? And whether or not we should see it as a revenue contributor or as maybe a means of driving therapeutic revenue?  And I am going across the categories with like diagnostics, insurance, Embrex, genomics, et cetera. And then, just a quick clarification question to the answer to Jon Block\u2019s question on the doubling of the pain market. Was that just in dogs? And then, cats is just a plus beyond that or was that $800 million or the doubling of $400 million just the dog and cat? Thank you. \nJoseph Wetteny: I'll start and see if Kristin wants to add anything. In terms of non-therapeutics, if you look at diagnostics, for example, where we saw 38% growth this quarter. So roughly $99 million of revenue on the quarter on the base of what we reported for the year. So, in relative terms, it's not the largest proportion of our revenue streams, certainly, but we are, very much excited about the potential for the future in the very fast growing markets as diagnostics which is expected to grow faster than the overall animal health space for us.  And really one more point that I'll make is, overall, we expect diagnostics as Kristin covered earlier, does have the impact continuum of care, we think overall increasing the use of diagnostics as we look to medicalization across pets will have a positive effect on overall therapeutics in the long haul, we think that's also an exciting opportunity for the long-term. \nKristin Peck: Sure. And I can take your second question with regards to the cat market. Yes, we think that would be incremental. It is a little hard to size the cat market today. There is really not much of an OA pain market in the U.S. There is some international products that are approved. But, as we talk about doubling the dogs from $400 million to $800 million, if you recall and it's again it's a little hard to size the cat market, maybe it's a $100 million. We think you can double that as well.  So I think that could be a $200 million market, which would make the OA category for us across dogs and cats, potentially a $1 billion market that we can play. And so, we think this is a very exciting space for us. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Your line is now open. \nBalaji Prasad - Barclays: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for questions. Just a couple for me. Firstly, on the parasiticides market, do you have a sense of relative size of where mix gotten better in the quarter and if Trio growth came in at the cost of competitors or some market expansion?  On the same point, you recently got a label expansion for Simparica. Could you also just describe take us through the implications for it commercially? And on the guidance side, could you also just take us through what led to a 1% revenue guide change and the 2% increase in SG&A? And where those increased expenditure is going into? Thanks. \nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Prasad. I'll take the first question, and I will let Wetteny take the second one. As we look I don\u2019t \u2013 I can't get into what our competitors products sales are. We remain quite excited for what the comparative is doing. We did get the additional label claim that was expected, that was included in the guidance that we had.  In the sense of where are we getting some of those sales from, it is an end. So, we are both growing the market. I think more people are moving back into prescribed products versus some the over-the-counter. But we're also seeing that we are taking share from many of our competitors, as well. So, it's an exciting opportunity across both dimensions.  Wetteny, do you want to take this other question? \nJoseph Wetteny: Yes. Look, one thing I would add in terms of parasiticides, I think it's a $5 billion market, that's growing around 5% and we're gaining share in this marketplace. We do think that with a triple combo, it's improving compliance with respect to heartworm, et cetera and so that we'll have the opportunity to continue to expand the market, as well.  So we're very pleased with the performance across our parasiticides portfolio and the share that we're gaining. We will continue to invest behind this product and this portfolio, as well. \nKristin Peck: Did you want to take the increase in guidance question? \nJoseph Wetteny: Yes, look, certainly, and when you look at our guidance, compared to where we started in the year and given the overall market - positive market dynamics that we see, our portfolio is performing very well. Kristin covered some of the trends around vet visits and so on. All those are contributing towards optimism and you've seen the year-to-date performance that we've delivered.  And in fact, we've taken our guidance in terms of top-line operational growth up from where we started in the year at 9% to 11%, now at 12.5% to 13.5%. So full three points above where we started the year. So, we're very pleased with how we started the year. I think if you look at from a overall perspective, certainly, the first half and the second half of the year, if you look at purely top-line, it's really roughly in line, pretty consistent sort of phasing across the year.  The growth rates will moderate based on last year, largely not really a matter of how this year is executing for us. We're in a very positive market dynamic with very strong performance across our portfolio. Last year, given the pandemic, there was a bit of variability across the year. There was disruption in the first half of the year, given COVID-19, which created more demand that got pent-up and caught up in the back half of the year.  So that's going to create a dynamic in terms of what the Vs look like in terms of growth rates first half versus second half. But we are very pleased with where we are and we are going to continue to invest behind our key portfolios and brands. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. \nChris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I just want to focus a little bit more on U.S. livestock. Can you talk a little bit again about the 2Q dynamics? Because it seems like you were going up against a fairly easy comp, but this was still down about 8% So, I was trying to get a sense of like, as we think about the rates of decline you're expecting in the business in the second half of the year, just help us conceptualize what type of erosion you're thinking about as we go up against, what seems like some tougher comps for those quarters?  And then, maybe from a longer term perspective, just walk a little bit through about how you're thinking about recovery for U.S. livestock as we think about both poultry and cattle as we get past some of these kind of more challenging near-term dynamics and just think about the longer term business? Thanks so much. \nKristin Peck: Thanks, Chris. I'll start on more on the strategic drivers and I'll Wetteny get into some of the specifics here. Livestock really has performed as we expected. As we talked about going into the year with the of LOE of DRAXXIN, we did expect a decline in general as we talked about for the last few years. That's generally 20% to 40% over two to three years.  And as we said, we thought that would be faster. As you look at the quarter, we did see a 19% decline overall in DRAXXIN, specifically. And I think that is of the key factors in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned earlier, I think this will continue. But if you look at broader livestock, historically, it's a low to mid-single-digit grower.  Certainly, if you saw in 2019 with AFS and China and 2020 with COVID, it's been lower than what you've historically seen. We do believe as we said that overall this will trend back to a market growth in the mid-single-digit, call it, around the 4% range, maybe be 3% to 5%.  And then we think the vet will be in line with that, it could be slightly lower over the next few years if you see this year and really the strategic driver of that is that we have a number we have the largest number of products hitting, lots of exclusivity. And as you look at our guidance, that's why it is baked in. So, it wasn't just DRAXXIN we also have one in poultry, you were just referencing had Zoamix and BMB as well.  But again, we've got good growth in some of these other species as well. If you look at poultry, we're really excited at the growth of vector vaccines. It\u2019s a $300 million market, growing 13%. We've already launched two of them Newcastle and IBD and that will be a growing portfolio for us. But, I'll like Wetteny get into some of the more specific numbers, but I do think if you look at livestock just more strategically on a higher level, I think it's going to be a lower grower than companion animal. But we do think it goes back to historical levels. Wetteny, if you want to build on that? \nJoseph Wetteny: Yes. Look, I mean, look, if you look at livestock across the world with protein consumption population growth, income levels rising, et cetera, we expect those to continue to drive growth in livestock for the long-term. We delivered 3% on the year, as we said it\u2019s as expected and as was covered in the prior earnings call, we expected declines in the U.S., particularly given the generic entry for DRAXXIN.  Now, the first quarter did benefit a bit from two things. One, there was a little bit of a delay in terms of the entry of generic for DRAXXIN, but also we ran a promotion in the first quarter that accelerates some revenue into Q1 taking it out of Q2. So, if you take those in consideration, which are exactly in line with our defense strategy, livestock really is performing exactly as we expected.  Now, given that the intensification of generic competition as we expected, just began really into the late first quarter into the second quarter, we expect the decline to continue. And again, they are right in line with our expectations here. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Steve Scala with Cowen. \nSteve Scala : Thank you. A local paper in Nebraska reported last week that Librela is being manufactured at the Lincoln plant. If that is correct, then is that product ultimately destined for the U.S.? And as the U.S. regulatory process evolves, can you confirm that it is still the case that no new clinical data is required? Thank you. \nKristin Peck: Sure. We mentioned - I mentioned earlier, we do believe we will see approval in the U.S. for both Librela and Solensia in 2022 with Librela most likely in the second half. We have long-term strategies from obviously multiple sites. I don't think the U.S. will be manufactured out of Librela at launch. We certainly are looking at potentially adding sites just given the strength as I mentioned earlier of that product.  So, we have been having ongoing conversations of regulatory authorities and we remain on track for the guidance we previously provided, which is approval for both of those products with Solensia likely earlier in the year and Librela later. But you should not probably expect that we are producing out of Lincoln Nebraska at launch for Librela. \nJoseph Wetteny: Look, given our global footprint and presence, you should not beat anything into the location of manufacturing in terms of where products are destined to. In particular, we'll continue to leverage both our footprint as well as third-parties that are manufacturing. And so I wouldn't draw any conclusion from that. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. \nMichael Parolari: Hi guys. This is actually Michael Parolari filling in for Elliot. Thanks for taking my question. So, I believe you said in the past that Trio has had about a 90% uptake on top corporate accounts. Just wondering if you provide an update though on penetration across all targeted accounts. And then, in relation to the DTC campaign, I know you said in your prepared remarks that it remains beneficial.  But just wondering if you could give a updated timeline line on how long you could see it continuing? And then also how you see incremental spend really driving ROI here? Thank you. \nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Michael. We continue to see very \u2013 we are at or surpassed all the clinic penetration that we expected for Trio. So we're quite pleased with that. And right now, we're a little more focused on reorder rates, as I mentioned. We think reorder trend for us now is I think our penetration is where we would expect it and it\u2019s very broad across the U.S. for Trio and we're to really focused on those reorders, which we now have at 80% continuing to grow those overall reorder rates.  Direct-to-consumer advertising is critical in this category. It is $5 billion. It is a category that consumers really do go in and ask for brand. We do obviously track our ROI in this and as you've seen and as Wetteny mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest behind this brand. We have seen incredibly strong ROI in doing so. And that is why you're seeing us step up that spend.  As we talked about earlier, it has outpaced our expectations. I think that has everything to do with the innovative nature of this product, but it also has to do with the investment we put behind that in direct-to-consumer advertising and investing with our field force and we will continue to do that. You should expect this year and next year, certainly, we have a window of opportunity with no competition in the U.S. and we will leverage that opportunity.  We still don't know exactly when we'll see competition. At this point, we don't expect any into the second half of 2022 at the earliest as we mentioned. But as long as we do not have competition, we will invest aggressively behind this brand. And even when we do, we will do it as well, because we've seen very strong ROI in doing that. \nOperator: And we will take our next question from Navaan Ty with Citi. \nNavaan Ty : Hi. Good morning. Could you comment on the capital allocation? Should we expect to a continuity of financial policy going forward? And also, following Jurox, should we expect further geographic expansion via bolt-on acquisition in addition to the internal investments? Thank you. \nJoseph Wetteny: Yes, sure. So, in terms of capital allocation, you should expect consistency in terms of how we've managed capital allocation with the focus first and foremost on internal investments. We have opportunities in terms of R&D, investing behind our brands, on advertising and promotion perspective, CapEx to support our growing pipeline including monoclonal antibodies, et cetera. That's really our first priority.  Of course, we'll take advantage of any opportunities from a business development perspective for M&A that helps to accelerate our growth in various markets in areas, as well. So that really follows in terms of investments. And then, as we have free cash flow generation very strong free cash generation, we'll look to return cash to our shareholders.  We\u2019ve increased our dividends as you've seen typically faster than our revenue and we reinitiated our share buyback program, which we were continuing. So, that remains consistent, I would say with the best. \nKristin Peck: And then, on direct, do you want to just comment on that BD geographic expansion? \nJoseph Wetteny: Yes. So, look, certainly in Jurox, we are excited to be bringing them once we get through the process here over the next six months and close the transaction. We try to bring Jurox into the Zoetis family. Australia is our fifth largest market globally. And this is really at our core. It does increase our presence in a therapeutic area with the leading product, as well.  So we're very excited about that opportunity and what it does for us. And we will continue to look for bolt-on opportunities to bring on both the core, as well as other areas of the business whether it's diagnostics or what have you, as well. \nOperator: And this does conclude today's question and answer session. I will now turn the program back over to Kristin Peck for any additional or closing remarks. \nKristin Peck: Great. Thank you everybody for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. We look forward to keeping updated on our business throughout the remainder of the year and continuing to deliver on our results and innovations that you and our customers expect. So, thanks so much for joining us today. Stay safe. \nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and getting vaccinated for COVID-19.  I'd like to start the call by welcoming our new Chief Financial Officer, Wetteny Joseph, who is joining me on the call today. As the former CFO of Catalent, Wetteny is a veteran of the biopharma industry and very familiar with many of you in the investment community. Wetteny joined us on June 1 and is off to a fast start learning all about the company and animal health, everything from cattle guarding and drive impacts to pet care trends and parasiticide season.  I am confident that Wetteny will make strong contribution to our ongoing market performance, value creation and leadership in animal health. I also want to take a moment to thank Glenn David for his partnership and all of his contributions to Zoetis as CFO over the last five years. Glenn has taken on a new role overseeing our international operations, and other business units including PHARMAQ, BioDevices, and Pumpkin Pet Insurance.  I know he will bring his signature leadership qualities, business skills and industry knowledge to this role and continue driving profitable growth in these areas.  Now turning to the second quarter, we achieved strong results once again with 22% operational growth in revenue and 28% operational growth in adjusted net income. Our companion animal portfolio generated 36% operational revenue growth, driven by our pet care parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and diagnostics.  Meanwhile, livestock product sales were up 3% operationally and remain in line with our expectations for more moderate growth this year. The second quarter results also reflected favorable comparisons to last year's second quarter, when the uncertainty of COVID-19 and related lockdowns were more severely felt across the animal health industry.  We are raising full year guidance for revenue and adjusted net income again this quarter to reflect our first half performance and confidence in the underlying growth drivers of our business. We remain on track for a very strong year and continue to focus on sustaining our investment in long-term growth opportunities.  With the strong cash flow and positive outlook, we are investing internally and externally in innovative new products, market expansion plans, and direct-to-consumer promotions that will support future growth. Our team has been delivering strong growth, based on internally developed companion animal, parasiticides, led by our Simparica, PROHEART Revolution Plus franchises. We've redefined care for the dermatology category with our development of Apoquel and Cytopoint, and we see more growth potential coming from our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, new vector vaccines for poultry, and the industry's first cloud-based diagnostic platform with AI capabilities.  In terms of our monoclonal antibodies for of alleviation of OA pain in dogs and cats, we continue to anticipate U. S. approval for Librela and Solensia in 2022.  Meanwhile, initial customer response from vet and pet owners in Europe has been excellent and we recently received approval of Solensia in Canada. I always say, with great pride, that we have the best field force in the animal health industry and we will continue to expand the scope, effectiveness and digital tools in ways that can enhance our customers' experience and support our growth objectives.  We've also seen a positive return on our investments in direct-to-consumer promotions for Simparica Apoquel, and disease awareness over the years. And DTC remains an area of ongoing investment to support our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios.  And finally, we continue to look externally for business development opportunities that can complement our portfolio and expand our market presence or capabilities. Yesterday, we announced plans to acquire Jurox, a privately held animal health company based in Australia expected to close in the first half of 2022.  The acquisition will provide us with growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity, and increased capabilities in Australia, our fifth largest market. And also bring us a range of companion animal and life livestock products primed for global expansion.  As I wrap up my remarks, our growth story for this year remains very consistent based on three recurring catalysts. First, our companion animal portfolio, driven by our triple combination Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our dermatology treatments, Apoquel and Cytopoint, new monoclonal antibodies for pain and our Vet Scan diagnostic systems.  The entire portfolio is benefiting from strong pet care trends in terms of increasing clinic visits, rising spend per visit and a focus on diagnostics and specialty care, especially among newer and younger generations of head owners.  Recent estimates for market growth in companion and animal products are in the high-single-digits and Zoetis continues to expect to grow faster than the market. We are gaining share in the approximately $5 billion global parasiticides market for pets, and we excited by veterinarian and pet owner responses to our new monoclonal antibodies for pain.  We also continue to see progress in the early launch of VetScan Imagyst, which leads to our second catalyst for growth, diagnostics, which posted 38% operational revenue growth in the second quarter and access to vet clinics in the U. S. rebounded from the year ago quarter.  Our third growth catalyst is international, where we continued to generate strong operational growth, driven by China and Brazil, which grew at 30% and 40% respectively.  All our catalysts for growth are buoyed by our priority to Champion, a healthier and more sustainable future, the commitments to our communities, animals, and the planet. You can read more about our progress on these ESG goals and our first Sustainability Report, which is published in June.  In closing, we had a great second quarter and we're focused on delivering our record-setting year. The market dynamics in animal health remains strong, steady and resilient, even during the challenging times, based on people's unbreakable bond with animals.  For the remainder of the year, our diverse portfolio, innovative pet care products, strengthen in diagnostics, and expansion in international markets will continue driving our performance.  Now, let me hand things off to Wetteny. Great. Thanks, Mike. I'll take the first question and I'll let Wetteny take the second question on the leverage. Yes, Simparica, and Simparica Trio did had a phenomenal quarter. Overall, as Wetteny mentioned, we had 50% growth in parasiticides. But, as you look at the quarter for Trio with the $139 million, it was incredibly strong. And I would say, Trio is and has been outpacing our expectations. In fact, the Simparica franchise in Q2 was the second largest in the flea tick, heartworm space.  So, we're very excited. We expect to continue to see this product grow. The market itself has now grown to over $5 billion. So, we remain super excited. We're doing well both on our penetration of clinics, as well as reorder. So we see strong momentum that we think will continue into the second half of the year. So, I'll let Wetteny take your second question. Sure. Thanks, Jon. Good to hear from you. I'll take the first question and I'll let Wetteny take the second question on livestock. We have been very excited at the uptick in Librela. As what we're seeing and your question about how is it really being used. We've seen really strong efficacy of the product. The feedback we've gotten and through early experience in our first quarter of sales is just us really quick efficacy.  So, they are noticing differences pretty quick. It's improving quality of life, better socialability. So we really think more and more vets are looking at this as a first-line therapy. We do think that there are significant opportunities for Librela to grow the category.  The dog categories you've talked about before, currently is $400 million. But we believe by bringing this type of innovation to the market, support them globally, but bringing this type of innovation from the safety and efficacy profile, we think we have the ability to potentially double that market, if you look at how many dogs there are, how many have away and how many are treated.  So, we look at the opportunity to grow this market in a few ways. Certainly, as I talked about getting more animals, getting more days on treatment, and better compliance and then, certainly with price of this product is priced at a premium to those are already in the market. So Wetteny, do you want to take the second question on livestock? Thanks Louise. Great to hear from you. Yes, we're very confident in the durability of the companion animal trends that you've seen throughout 2020 and 2021. So, as you look in the quarter, we saw overall clinic revenues up 14% and that was equally split between vet visits and spend per visit. And our confidence in the fact that these durable trends really have to do with a few things; one, there are more pets. We've talked about that for a number of quarters.  The other thing is, it's going to increase in the standard of care, the expectations of pet owners, greater use across the portfolio, greater use of diagnostics, more people home noticing more about their pets. But the other really important trend that's going to continue to play out is who is adopting a lot more of these pets and that's a lot of millennials and GenZ and they tend of spend more on their pets. They're very engaged in their care. So, we see these as durable trends that will continue, and will remain a big growth driver for the company over the coming years. Thanks, Katie. As you look at diagnostics, it was a very strong quarter with 38% operational growth. Diagnosis, as we've talked about remains a very attractive segment with double-digit growth. And it really - it's core to the way that that practice operates.  Again, pets cannot tell you exactly how they are feeling. So we continue to see this being a really strong part of our continuum of care strategy. It's critical to the best practice. We did incredibly strong growth as you saw in the quarter in international making significant placements, very strong in the U.S. and we're focused on a few things there.  Certainly, it's placements as we talked about where we are seeing good growth there, stronger in the quarter in international than the U.S. but also really driving consumable use. And we think that remains a big opportunity for us versus competition getting more consumable use in the placements that we have. And then, really adding on to the innovation, so, if you look at the images launch, it had done better than our expectations. We continue to see very strong growth there.  Right now, the indication for the VetScan Imagyst is in sequel and that's a large market, it's about $500 million, growing at 7% to 8%. So, we see really strong growth there. I don't know, what 8% and adds? Sure. And I can take your second question with regards to the cat market. Yes, we think that would be incremental. It is a little hard to size the cat market today. There is really not much of an OA pain market in the U.S. There is some international products that are approved. But, as we talk about doubling the dogs from $400 million to $800 million, if you recall and it's again it's a little hard to size the cat market, maybe it's a $100 million. We think you can double that as well.  So I think that could be a $200 million market, which would make the OA category for us across dogs and cats, potentially a $1 billion market that we can play. And so, we think this is a very exciting space for us. Sure. Thanks, Prasad. I'll take the first question, and I will let Wetteny take the second one. As we look I don't \u2013 I can't get into what our competitors products sales are. We remain quite excited for what the comparative is doing. We did get the additional label claim that was expected, that was included in the guidance that we had.  In the sense of where are we getting some of those sales from, it is an end. So, we are both growing the market. I think more people are moving back into prescribed products versus some the over-the-counter. But we're also seeing that we are taking share from many of our competitors, as well. So, it's an exciting opportunity across both dimensions.  Wetteny, do you want to take this other question? Did you want to take the increase in guidance question? Thanks, Chris. I'll start on more on the strategic drivers and I'll Wetteny get into some of the specifics here. Livestock really has performed as we expected. As we talked about going into the year with the of LOE of DRAXXIN, we did expect a decline in general as we talked about for the last few years. That's generally 20% to 40% over two to three years.  And as we said, we thought that would be faster. As you look at the quarter, we did see a 19% decline overall in DRAXXIN, specifically. And I think that is of the key factors in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned earlier, I think this will continue. But if you look at broader livestock, historically, it's a low to mid-single-digit grower.  Certainly, if you saw in 2019 with AFS and China and 2020 with COVID, it's been lower than what you've historically seen. We do believe as we said that overall this will trend back to a market growth in the mid-single-digit, call it, around the 4% range, maybe be 3% to 5%.  And then we think the vet will be in line with that, it could be slightly lower over the next few years if you see this year and really the strategic driver of that is that we have a number we have the largest number of products hitting, lots of exclusivity. And as you look at our guidance, that's why it is baked in. So, it wasn't just DRAXXIN we also have one in poultry, you were just referencing had Zoamix and BMB as well.  But again, we've got good growth in some of these other species as well. If you look at poultry, we're really excited at the growth of vector vaccines. It's a $300 million market, growing 13%. We've already launched two of them Newcastle and IBD and that will be a growing portfolio for us. But, I'll like Wetteny get into some of the more specific numbers, but I do think if you look at livestock just more strategically on a higher level, I think it's going to be a lower grower than companion animal. But we do think it goes back to historical levels. Wetteny, if you want to build on that? Sure. We mentioned - I mentioned earlier, we do believe we will see approval in the U.S. for both Librela and Solensia in 2022 with Librela most likely in the second half. We have long-term strategies from obviously multiple sites. I don't think the U.S. will be manufactured out of Librela at launch. We certainly are looking at potentially adding sites just given the strength as I mentioned earlier of that product.  So, we have been having ongoing conversations of regulatory authorities and we remain on track for the guidance we previously provided, which is approval for both of those products with Solensia likely earlier in the year and Librela later. But you should not probably expect that we are producing out of Lincoln Nebraska at launch for Librela. Sure. Thanks, Michael. We continue to see very \u2013 we are at or surpassed all the clinic penetration that we expected for Trio. So we're quite pleased with that. And right now, we're a little more focused on reorder rates, as I mentioned. We think reorder trend for us now is I think our penetration is where we would expect it and it's very broad across the U.S. for Trio and we're to really focused on those reorders, which we now have at 80% continuing to grow those overall reorder rates.  Direct-to-consumer advertising is critical in this category. It is $5 billion. It is a category that consumers really do go in and ask for brand. We do obviously track our ROI in this and as you've seen and as Wetteny mentioned earlier, we will continue to invest behind this brand. We have seen incredibly strong ROI in doing so. And that is why you're seeing us step up that spend.  As we talked about earlier, it has outpaced our expectations. I think that has everything to do with the innovative nature of this product, but it also has to do with the investment we put behind that in direct-to-consumer advertising and investing with our field force and we will continue to do that. You should expect this year and next year, certainly, we have a window of opportunity with no competition in the U.S. and we will leverage that opportunity.  We still don't know exactly when we'll see competition. At this point, we don't expect any into the second half of 2022 at the earliest as we mentioned. But as long as we do not have competition, we will invest aggressively behind this brand. And even when we do, we will do it as well, because we've seen very strong ROI in doing that. And then, on direct, do you want to just comment on that BD geographic expansion? Great. Thank you everybody for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. We look forward to keeping updated on our business throughout the remainder of the year and continuing to deliver on our results and innovations that you and our customers expect. So, thanks so much for joining us today. Stay safe."

Before I discuss our second quarter performance, I would like to take a moment to express how excited I to join Zoetis, a company with an exceptional opportunity for meaningful for long-term growth, driven by the durability and resiliency of the existing portfolio, a robust product pipeline and a key focus on future innovation.  I look forward to leading an outstanding finance organization and maintaining the financial principles and investment strategies, which position Zoetis as the world leader in animal health. I would also like to express my appreciation to the Zoetis colleagues and the investment community for such a warm and gracious welcome.  I had the pleasure of speaking with several of our investors since becoming CFO and I look forward to connecting with many more in the coming weeks.  Now shifting the focus to earnings. This morning, I will provide commentary on our second quarter financial results, the key contributing factors to our performance and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 26% on a reported basis and 22% operational.  Adjusted net income of $566 million was an increase of 33% on a reported basis and 28% operationally. Operational revenue grew 22% with 2% from price and 20% from volume. Volume growth includes 12% from other in line products, 6% from new products and 2% from key dermatology products.  We delivered another strong quarter and remain encouraged by the performance of our business, health of the overall industry and our outlook for the future. It is worth noting that Q2 2020 is a favorable comparative period due to the impact of COVID-19.  The pandemic caused widespread uncertainty last year, which led to clinic closures, supply chain disruptions, and shifts in consumer demand from restaurant and foodservice to grocery stores. This materially impacted several aspects of our companion animal and livestock businesses.  Now let's dive further into the details of the quarter. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 36% operationally with livestock growing 3% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was again driven by our parasiticides portfolio, led by sales of Simparica Trio and with significant contributions from the broader portfolio.  We also continue to see growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in vaccines and diagnostics.  Simparica Trio had continued to perform exceptionally well, posting revenue of $139 million, representing growth of more than 200% versus the comparable 2020 period. In addition to sales, we are exceeding our other performance measures as well, such as clinic penetration, share within penetrated clinics and reordering rates.  The strength of our entire companion animal parasiticides portfolio was evident again this quarter growing 50% operationally with meaningful growth in the ProHeart and Revolution strong growth franchises in addition to the Simparica franchise. Having the broadest and most innovative portfolio within a larger and expanding therapeutic area is as bullish on future growth in parasiticides.  Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio was $280 million in the quarter, growing 22% operationally. Cytopoint had an particularly strong quarter, growing 42% operationally and generating quarterly revenue of $100 million for the first time since launch. Year-to-date sales for key dermatology products of $524 million in our view remains unchanged that sales will exceed $1 billion this year.  Our diagnostics portfolio had operational growth of 38% in Q2, led by increases in consumable and estimate revenue as the business continues to recover from the impact of the pandemic. With our sustained investments in diagnostics, the newest technology we are bringing to the market and the ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio, we are well-positioned to grow faster than the diagnostics market, which is expected to grow double-digits and outpace the overall animal health markets.  Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Cattle grew 3% and swine grew 6% operationally, despite price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs, weighing on producer profitability in the U. S. Data suggests the foodservice service and restaurant industries continued to recover in the second quarter, which is a crucial dynamic for demand of our premium products.  Poultry was the only species to decline in the quarter, which fell 4% as producers in the U. S. expanded their use of lower cost alternatives to our products. The decline in poultry partially offset the growth in cattle, swine and fish products.  Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 22% with sales of companion animal products growing 34% and livestock product sales declining 8%. U.S. quarterly revenue exceeded $1 billion for the first time in company history.  For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain robust. Placement revenue increased double-digits in the quarter and patient visits and spend per visit were up as well. While we expect some of the trends to moderate, our view is we will remain above pre-COVID-19 levels.  In addition, a meaningful portion of pet acquisitions, which occurred during the pandemic were by millennial and GenZ. This infuses a solid foundation of younger pet ownership, who are willing to spend disproportionately more on all aspects of pet than prior generations and will be a key growth driver for companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics moving forward.  Our companion animal parasiticides portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth in the U.S. growing 59% in the quarter. Key hematology products, vaccines and diagnostics also contributed to growth.  Simparica Trio had an incredibly strong quarter in the U.S. with sales of $120 million generating the highest revenue by a single product in the U.S. for Q2. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $153 million, growing 96% and remained the number two brand in the U.S. flea tick and heartworm markets.  Key dermatology sales were $197 million for the quarter, growing 23% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. Diagnostics sales increased 22% in the quarter with growth in instruments, rapid, test, point-of-care consumables and reference lab revenue.  U.S. livestock sales fell 8% in the quarter, driven by declines in cattle and poultry with swine essentially flat for the quarter. Q2 cattle sales were negatively impacted by a promotional program in the first quarter of this year, which pulled forward a portion of second quarter sales.  In addition, price reductions as part of our generic defense strategy and higher input costs weighing on beef and dairy end-markets, presented challenges to our cattle business this quarter. Poultry declined in the quarter, as produces expanded use of lower cost alternatives to our premium products as a result of higher feed cost and labor wages and smaller flux sizes reducing disease pressure. We also face generic competition for Zoamix, our alternative to antibiotics in medicated feed additives.  To summarize, our U.S. operations delivered another strong quarter, led by our innovative and robust companion animal portfolio. The end-market dynamics for companion animal remain extremely healthy with pet ownership and pet spending trends driving an environment conducive to sustainable future growth, which is expected to more than offset the near-term weaknesses in our U.S. livestock business.  Now turning to our international segment. Revenue in our international segment also grew 22% operationally in the quarter with companion animal revenue growing 41% and livestock revenue growing 10% operationally. The trends fueling strength in our international companion animal business are very similar to those in the U.S.  The increasing medicalization rates and standard of care by pet owners, coupled with significant investments in advertising and promotion to support new product launches and key brands drove growth across our parasiticides, vaccines, diagnostics, and key dermatology portfolios.  Diagnostics were one 106% operationally in the quarter, with consumables and instrument revenue, each exceeding 100% operational growth.  Librela, our monoclonal antibody for of alleviation of OA pain in dogs launched in the EU in the second quarter. Feedback from the early experience trials in Q1 was encouraging and second quarter sales exceeded our expectations further supporting our optimism on the long-term blockbuster potential of the product, as well as monoclonal antibodies as a platform for future growth.  Our feline line monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain Solensia began early experience programs in the second quarter with an EU launch following in Q3. As previously mentioned, OA pain in cats is a significant unmet need in animal health and we're excited to provide pet owners with a novel product in a space that has previously lacked innovation.  Meanwhile, our international livestock business had its second consecutive quarter with growth across all species led by strong operational growth in cattle and swine. Cattle growth in the quarter was driven by marketing campaigns, key account penetration and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets.  Revenue growth in swine is largely attributed to China, which grew 38% operationally. The theme for growth in swine remain consistent with previous quarters has large key accounts increased their use of our vaccines and other products as they continued to expand production as the market shifts from smaller farms to larger scale modern operations.  Our fish portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% operationally. Growth was driven by strong performance of Alpha Flux in Chile, vaccine volume in Norway and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. From a market perspective lens, all major markets grew double-digits in the second quarter with the exception of Japan, which declined slightly in Q2.  China and Brazil had strong quarters, growing 30% and 40% respectively on an operational basis. Growth in companion animal across emerging markets remains a key driver of our international business and in addition to the growth in China and Brazil, our other emerging markets companion animal business grew 68% operationally.  Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, demonstrating the importance of our diversity across species and geography. The livestock business continues to perform well and increasing pet acquisitions and pet care spending are extremely encouraging trends for long-term growth in companion animal.  Now moving onto to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margins of 71% is essentially flat on a reported basis, compared to the prior year, as favorable product mix and price were offset by higher manufacturing cost and freight.  Adjusted operating expenses increased 23% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs, advertising and promotion expense and freight.  The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%, a decrease of 230 basis points, driven by the favorable impact of a jurisdictional mix of earnings, lower GILTI tax and an increase in favorable discrete items, compared to the prior year's comparable quarter.  Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth.  We remain in a very strong liquidity position and continued our share buyback program, repurchasing approximately $165 million worth of shares in the quarter. The strength of our balance sheet and substantial free cash flow generation allows us to make significant investments for future growth, while still returning excess cash to shareholders.  Before I review our updated guidance, I would like to reiterate a point that has been discussed on prior earnings calls, which is that, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of varying comparative periods, where pent-up demand created by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half of the year in addition to the expected increased generic competition for DRAXXIN.  Adjusting for the variability in the comparative period due to the pandemic, our phasing of top-line growth would be more normalized and consistent quarter-to-quarter throughout this year.  Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising and narrowing as a result of our second quarter performance, strength of our product portfolio, and favorable market dynamics, which we expect to continue in the second half. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-July.  For revenue, we are raising and narrowing in our guidance range. We've projected revenue now between $7.625 billion and $7.7 billion and operational revenue growth between 12.5% and 13.5% for the full year versus the 10.5% to 12% in our May guidance.  Adjusted SG&A expense for the year are expected to be between $1.87 billion and $1.91 billion, versus $1.82 billion and $1.87 billion in our prior guidance. The increased spend represents additional advertising and promotion investments, a significant portion of which will occur in the third quarter, as well as compensation-related cost due to the company performance.  Adjusted net income is now expected be in the range of $2.135 billion and $2.175 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%, compared to our prior guidance of 12% to 14%.  Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.47 to $4.55 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.19.  Now to summarize before we move on to Q&A. Our strong performance in the first half of 2021 continues to underscore the value of our diversity, innovation and durable business model. We again raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance and expect to grow faster than the markets. We continue to focus on long-term sustainable growth by investing in our pipeline, including infrastructure to support current and future product launches and remain very positive in our outlook for sustainable growth beyond this year.  Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?"

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode. And the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2021 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K in our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 6, 2021. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and able to get vaccinated for COVID-19, if not already, then soon. We've been very fortunate in the U.S. as vaccination rates are up and infection rates are trending down overall. But that is not the situation everywhere. In many countries, improving access to vaccines and controlling infection rates are critical hurdles for a more comprehensive global recovery. Yet with the extraordinary measures being taken by so many, I remain optimistic about the steady progress we're making to beat this pandemic. I'm also very proud of what we've been able to do at Zoetis and our own small way to support the global effort. We've been able to keep our colleagues safe, encourage and assist them with vaccinations where possible, and continue serving our customers in the care of their animals. And we're off to a very strong start in 2021, executing on strategies for building on our innovative pet care portfolio, expanding in key markets by the U.S. and accelerating our growth in diagnostics. In the first quarter, we grew our top line revenue at 21% operationally, our best quarter ever, with 25% operational growth internationally and 19% growth in the U.S. China and Brazil led our international performance with 75% and 48% operational growth respectively, exhibiting their strength in both companion animal and livestock product sales. In total, our companion animal portfolio grew 34% operationally based on the strength of our parasiticide and dermatology products, while our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally with solid growth in cattle, swine and fish products. Digging deeper on pet care, it has been one year since the launch of our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio. It is exceeding expectations and has been well received by customers, with a-90% plus penetration rate in our largest U. S. corporate accounts. Simparica Trio is the latest growth catalyst for a portfolio of small animal parasiticides. After several successful innovations in the last few years, these products made up 16% of our total sales in the first quarter and includes such brands as Simparica, Simparica Trio, Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart. We believe the ongoing market shift to e-commerce is another boost for this category, helping to increase compliance and months on therapy. And our direct-to-consumer campaigns for Simparica and Simparica Trio continued showing a solid return on investment in markets around the world. Meanwhile, our key dermatology portfolio led by Apoquel and Cytopoint, demonstrated continued double-digit growth. We are seeing excellent traction and significant growth of off the range international markets. Our dermatology portfolio has further growth potential as we continue expanding our international customer base and seek to become a more common first-line treatment for osteoarthritis in dogs. Veterinarians and pet owners alike appreciate the exceptional standard of care that our products can provide. In the companion animal space, we also continue to be pleased with our diagnostics portfolio, which grew 47% operationally in the first quarter. We have grown our point-of-care diagnostic sales made excellent progress on improving our connectivity solutions in veterinary practices, and have seen our cloud-based VetScan Imagyst platform receiving very positive customer feedback, with placements exceeding expectations in the early launch. We're also making progress on our reference labs integrations and look forward to future expansions in this space, both in the U.S. and internationally. Our growth in livestock was driven by the performance of cattle, swine and fish in the first quarter. Cattle product sales in the U.S. were strong as the food service sector has started to recover and generic competition for DRAXXIN was later than expected. Meanwhile, swine benefited from the continued recovery from African swine fever in China. Thanks to the unprecedented growth in revenue and our continued financial discipline and adaptability throughout COVID-19. Our adjusted net income 3%, 4% operationally. Looking ahead we are leading guidance for operational growth and full year revenue to the range of 10. 5% to 12%. And while we had an unusually strong first quarter, we expect more normalized revenue growth in the second half of the year due to tougher comparative quarters and increasing generic competition for DRAXXIN. Glenn will provide more details on other guidance updates in his remarks. Since the beginning of the year, Zoetis has continued to advance our key priorities, including key milestones for new products and life cycle innovations and geographic expansions for major brands. Since our last earnings announcement, we received approval in the European Union for Solensia the first injectable monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and will be launching this year. Osteoarthritis is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated today due to limited options for therapy and difficulty recognizing pain in cats. Meanwhile, Librela, our monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of OA pain in dogs, has launched in the EU. And we're seeing a great customer response from vets and dogs owners who referenced increased activity, social ability and quality of life for their pets. In the U.S., we continued discussions with the FDA regarding our regulatory submissions and manufacturing inspection for Librela and Solensia, and we now anticipate approvals for both products in 2022, with Librela likely later in the year. We will provide updates on U.S. revenue expectations for these products in 2022 as we get further clarity on approval timing and rollout plans. It is also worth noting that in China, which is our second largest market in terms of revenue, Zoetis recently received approvals for several leading products, Fostera PCV MH a 1-shot vaccine for pigs, Excenel RTU EZ, a key anti-infective for cattle and swine, and Revolution Plus, our latest parasiticide for cats. We continue to strengthen our portfolio in China, one of our key catalysts for growth. We're also maximizing our key brands with more geographic expansion. In poultry, we expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT ND in Canada, Brazil and several other smaller markets. And in parasiticide, we received additional approvals for Simparica Trio in Japan, Mexico and several other smaller markets. In terms of sustainability, we published our long-term goals in March with specific commitments to continuities, animals and the planet. We've built a comprehensive and rigorous approach through our Driven to Care program, and our goals include support for 10 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We'll be releasing more detail on these goals and our initial progress in our sustainability report this June. In closing, the fundamental growth drivers for our industry continue to show strong and sustainable momentum. Pet adoption trends and higher spending per visit in the U. S. along with increased medicalization rates in markets outside the U.S. all continue to bode well for significant growth in our companion animal and diagnostic portfolios globally. We feel very confident about where our companion animal business has come over the last few years, launching innovative new products, defining new standards of treatment and expanding our global reach. In 2014, our companion animal business was 34% of our total revenue. Last year, it had grown to 55% based on the strength of our innovation and investment in growth, and we see that continuing to expand. In livestock, the industry is in a more limited innovation cycle, and we expect modest growth for the year. Livestock growth is tied closely to the pandemic and how quickly the foodservice industry recovers. For Zoetis, we also anticipate increasing headwinds of generic competition to DRAXXIN, but we expect our life cycle innovation and competitive strategies to help us mitigate the impact. While U.S. livestock may present challenges for us in the near term, I feel very positive about our catalysts for growth in pet care, diagnostics and international markets like China and Brazil. We continue to be led by our companion animal parasiticide and dermatology portfolio with more growth to come, and we see a bright future ahead for our monoclonal antibodies for pain.  Diagnostics is accelerating its growth as we increase our global footprint, expand our reference labs and demonstrates the potential for VetScan images to veterinary clinics. And internationally, China continues to be a market with significant growth potential, not only in swine products but with a sizable opportunity for increased medicalization of pets. And we expect major growth to continue in Brazil across the companion animal and livestock portfolios. As always, we remain confident that Zoetis' diverse portfolio across products and geographies, our continued pipeline of innovative new products and life cycle innovations, and the agility and commitment of our colleagues will continue driving our success in 2021 and beyond. Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our first quarter results and updated guidance for the full year 2021.\nGlenn David: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, delivering substantial growth on a global basis and across species and therapeutic areas. Today, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance, and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 22% on a reported basis and 21% operationally. Adjusted net income of $603 million was an increase of 33% of on a reported basis and 34% operationally. Operational revenue grew 21%, resulting entirely from volume increases with price flat for the quarter. Volume growth of 21% includes 13% from other in line products, 5% from new products, and 3% from key dermatology products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 34% operationally, with livestock growing 8% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada, Australia and Mexico. We also saw growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in small animal vaccines and diagnostics. Following blockbuster sales in year one, Simparica Trio begin 2021 with strong first quarter performance, posting revenue of $90 million, growing sequentially each quarter since launch. The underlying dynamics that drove first quarter sales are very favorable for significant future growth, such as increasing clinic penetration and robust reordering rates within penetrated clinics. I'd again like to mention how pleased we are with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio which, in addition to the Simparica franchise, had significant growth in the Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart franchises as well. U.S. market share within the flea, tick and heartworm segment is now at an all-time high of 31%, representing an increase of more than 9% for the first quarter versus the same period in the prior year. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $245 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally. We remain confident that key dermatology sales will exceed $1 billion this year. Our diagnostics portfolio grew 47% in Q1, led by increases in consumable and instrument revenue. 2020 presented challenging conditions for our diagnostics business, as social distancing restrictions limited our ability to enter vet clinics and increase our market share. However, our vast product portfolio, commitment to innovation, and ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio has us well positioned to grow faster than the overall diagnostics market. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Improving market conditions from the COVID-19 recovery as well as successful promotional activities led to increased sales across the cattle portfolio. In addition, later-than-expected timing of generic entrants led to strong first quarter sales for DRAXXIN. Our swine portfolio grew 19% operationally as large producers continued rebuilding herds as they recover from African swine fever and created significant demand for our products. Poultry sales declined in the first quarter as producers expanded their use of lower-cost alternatives to our premium products. The decline in poultry partially tempered the growth in cattle, swine and fish. Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 19%, with companion animal products growing 32% and livestock sales declining by 4%. For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain promising. While severe weather caused a slight decline in vet clinic traffic for the quarter, revenue per visit was up more than 10%. In addition, pet ownership has increased and is trending towards a younger demographic, and younger pet owners typically spend more on pet care. This is a key driver for increased revenue per visit and creates robust demand for our diverse portfolio. Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth, growing 74% in the quarter. Diagnostics, key dermatology products and small animal vaccines also contributed to growth. Simparica Trio continues to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $83 million. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $112 million in the quarter and is now the number two brand in the U.S. flea, tick and heartworm segment. Companion animal diagnostic sales increased 62% in the quarter as the continued recovery at the vet clinic and a favorable prior year comparative period led to significant growth in point-of-care consumable revenue. Key dermatology sales were $157 million for the quarter, growing 16% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. U.S. livestock declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by poultry as producers switching to lower-cost alternatives unfavorably impacted our business. Swine also declined in the quarter, which is attributed almost entirely to a favorable nonrecurring government purchase, which occurred in Q1 2020. Cattle grew 6% in the quarter as promotional programs and the timing of generic entrants drove growth across the product portfolio. Growth in cattle partially offset the declines in poultry and swine. To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a very favorable companion animal market environment, in which we offer the broadest and most innovative product portfolio. Although livestock declined in the quarter with expectations of further declines for the year, we are encouraged by a series of foodservice trends such as increased dining out and school and business reopenings. Revenue in our international segment grew 25% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal revenue growing 37% operationally and livestock revenue growing 17% operationally. The strength in companion animal was fueled by the continuing trends of pet adoptions, increasing standard of care by pet owners, and our investments in advertising, all of which drove growth across our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios. Companion animal diagnostics grew 18% in the quarter, led by a 24% increase in point-of-care consumable revenue and a second consecutive quarter of double-digit increase in instrument placement revenue. We began early experience programs for Librela, a monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs. The feedback from the programs has been extremely positive, and further solidifies our view of the long-term potential of the product with an EU launch currently underway. Our feline monoclonal antibody, Solensia, will begin early experience programs in Q2. And with an EU launch to follow in the third quarter. Solensia will provide cat owners an innovative therapy to address one of the largest unmet needs in animal health. Our international livestock business saw double-digit growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which grew low single digits in the quarter. Swine revenue grew 29% operationally led by growth in China of 128%, marking the third consecutive quarter with swine growth in excess of 100%. While additional outbreaks and strains of African swine fever have occurred, we believe it is contained to a specific region and a limited number of customers. Cattle grew 11% operationally in the quarter as a result of marketing campaigns, key account penetration, and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 39% operationally driven by strong performance in Chile, the timing of seasonal vaccination protocols, and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. All major markets grew in the first quarter, many in double digits. China total sales grew 75% operationally, which, in addition to the significant growth in swine, delivered 59% operational growth in companion animal. Brazil grew 48% operationally in the quarter as sales of Simparica, the leading oral parasiticide in the Brazilian market, drove a 73% operational increase in companion animal. Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, again, demonstrating the value of substantial geographic and species diversification. Our companion animal business benefited from favorable trends such as rising medicalization rates outside the U.S. And while swine was the largest growth driver for our international livestock business, the contributions were broad-based with growth across all species. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 71% increased 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange and other costs, including freight. Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs and advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio. This was partially offset by reductions to T&E costs as a result of COVID-19. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, an increase of 230 basis points driven by a reduction in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter, partially offset by the favorable impact of the jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 34% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth. We resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter, repurchasing approximately $180 million worth of shares. Along with our dividend, share repurchase is a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy. We remain in a strong liquidity position and are highly cash generative. And as a result, we expect to be able to execute on all investment priorities including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development, while still returning excess cash to shareholders. Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising as a result of our first quarter performance. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range, with projected revenue now between $7.5 billion and $7.625 billion and operational revenue growth between 10.5% and 12% for the full year versus the 9% to 11% in our February guidance. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.16 billion, representing operational growth of 12% to 14% compared to our prior guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.51, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.08 to $4.19. Our key assumptions for 2021 have not changed materially since the guidance we provided on our Q4 2020 call. However, our current view is that we will not face competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or our key view is that we will or our key dermatology products until the second half of 2022. On our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we anticipated growth to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, and I'd like to take this time to expand upon that further. We are expecting first half 2021 growth to materially outpace growth in the second half of the year, primarily resulting from Simparica Trio sales and the favorable Q2 2020 comparative period related to COVID-19. Subsequently, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of increased generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as challenging comparative periods when pent-up demand in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half. Now to summarize before we move to Q&A, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom line growth in the first quarter with significant gains in both companion animal and livestock and across nearly every therapeutic area and geography. In addition, we raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance. And while growth will moderate in the back half of the year for the reasons I outlined, we again expect to grow faster than the market and feel very positive about our position for sustained growth beyond this year. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question today from Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great. Can you speak a little bit more about the underlying trends you're seeing across the U.S. livestock business? How has that segment performed quarter-to-date? And it seems that DRAXXIN competition has played out a little bit better than your expectations, but has anything changed in terms of how you're thinking about that headwind over the course of 2021? And then my second question is on parasiticides. It does represent a larger portion of your portfolio than it has historically. I guess how should we think about the seasonality of that business, the purchasing patterns both across retailers and vet clinics? And did you see any sort of pull forward outsized stocking dynamics in the quarter that we should be aware of and what your guidance now assumes for Simparica Trio?\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Erin. As you think about U.S. livestock, as Glenn mentioned, overall U.S. livestock was down 4%, but there was lots of different trends in there. U.S. cattle was up 6% in the quarter. And I think if you look at that, that was driven by later-than-expected entrants in the generics. So we were expecting more entrants sooner. But to your point, we don't really think it's going to end up playing out any differently by the end. And so what do I mean by that? If you look at that, we think the entrants will come, we think once they do, we'll likely end up -- if you look at generics, it's certainly 20% to 40% on penetration. And what we said is we think that's likely what it's going to be with DRAXXIN, both in the U.S. and in the EU and really around the globe. But as you think about that, it's likely going to happen a little bit later in the year. So we did do better in the beginning of the year. But if you look at that and you compare it to how we did internationally on DRAXXIN more specifically, so although you saw 6% growth in DRAXXIN in the U.S. internationally -- sorry I meant overall DRAXXIN internationally is actually down, and that was because we did have a multiple entrants sooner in that. So I don't think livestock really is going to play out any differently. We did see, as Glenn mentioned, a decline in poultry overall. And there is some seasonality obviously if you think about cattle. Swine was down and poultry. But overall I think we continue to remind, if you look at livestock overall for us, it was up 8%. I think what often people underappreciate it is that 60% of livestock is outside of the U.S. And although we focus a lot on U.S. cattle, the growth as you saw in China across swine which had 128% growth, and in Brazil still meant livestock did quite well. As you think about the parasiticides, I'll let Glenn sort of take some of that and get into some of the more specific trends.\nGlenn David: Yes. So thanks, Erin. So from a parasiticide perspective, we had a really strong quarter with the Simparica franchise, 133% growth in the franchise. Great performance from Simparica Trio with $90 million in the quarter alone, and Simparica also delivering $74 million with 38% growth. In terms of seasonality, we typically do see Q1 and particularly Q2 being the stronger quarters from a parasiticide portfolio perspective, particularly in the U.S. However, as we do see Simparica Trio on a ramp-up curve, the impact of that seasonality may be a little different this year as we do expect to continue to increase our clinic penetration and adoption and market share within the clinics as well. So there definitely is some seasonality within the parasiticide portfolio. But with the continued ramp-up on the product, it may not be as severe as you would typically see with an established product.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: I want to start on China, just really incredible growth this year -- this quarter. Obviously, you highlighted some of the aspects there. African swine fever bounce-back. And then companion has been doing well there for a while, and it's nice to see that, that continues to grow. I'm just wondering if you could opine on how sustainable that is. I mean that 123 million number, is that a new jumping off point that we should be thinking about in terms of run rate going forward and obviously growing from that? Or could there have been some bulk orders, for example in swine, as some of these producers restart their operations? And then another question for Glenn. On the OpEx guide, I'm just wondering if you could talk through a little bit of the details of what you're assuming for operating leverage in the second half. Are there any additional DTC programs for Trio? Are you restarting to see any expense? Is there any inflation factor in? Just wondering how we should think about the SG&A ramp going forward.\nKristin Peck: Thanks. Thanks, Mike. So starting with China, and I'll let Glenn take the second question. We do think this is a very sustainable growth driver in China, and really what drives that is a few things. One, I think you'll see African swine fever continuing a rebuild of the herd there. It is going to take a few years to rebuild that, so I think that is going to be for the next few years of sustainable growth. You saw swine grow in the quarter at 128%. But I think what's also really important to focus on is how well companion animal did, which grew 59%. We've been launching a number of new products, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. We had the launch of Fostera PCV MH as well as Revolution Plus. So continuing to bring in new products, seeing really, really good growth across both companion animal and livestock, makes us believe that China and the investments we've even talked about in building additional facilities there and growing our biologics footprint, we are very bullish on China continuing to be a sustainable growth driver for the company. Do you want to take the question onwards?\nGlenn David: Yes. And I just want to make other comments on China, Mike, to your other question as well. We did have $123 million in sales. Q1 typically does tend to be the larger quarter of sales for China. So that necessarily isn't one that you would run off of for the rest of the year. But to Kristin's point, I'm very excited about the growth prospects that we have for China for the year. In terms of the OpEx, we grew 8% in OpEx in the first quarter, which is pretty indicative of what the guidance range would indicate for the year. But there'll be different dynamics throughout the quarters to that. So for Q1 with the growth of 8%, that really was driven by a lot of the incremental DTC that we had for Simparica Trio in the quarter. And also, we didn't have savings from T&E in Q1. We had the savings from T& E in Q1, because in Q1 of 2020, that was pre-COVID. We still had our elevated T&E spend. As we move throughout the year, obviously we're not going to have that benefit. So the impact of the incremental DTC for Simparica Trio will be there, but we also increased our spending for DTC for Simparica Trio throughout the year last year. So a number of different factors, but the overall level of growth for the year perspective is pretty similar to what we saw for the quarter.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: First one, Glenn for you, just in the overall top line steps up, do we attribute that solely to companion animal? It seems like livestock, just based on your comments, might still be in the up low single-digit range. And maybe more specifically, is the step-up in companion just due to Trio? I mean if you annualize out the 90 million, you get to 360 already. And it seems like that was in and around the original guidance when we think about the contribution to growth. And then, Kristin, maybe just can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in the poultry market? Was those lower end competitive dynamics specific to the U.S.? Did it surface in international? Maybe what's going to be the Zoetis' response in coming quarters?\nGlenn David: Sure. So in terms of the overall top line step-up in the guidance, there are a number of factors that drove that beyond just companion animals. So obviously very pleased with the performance of Simparica Trio, and that is definitely one of the drivers for the guidance range. But as Kristin mentioned, also very strong performance in China, off to a very strong start to the year. Strong performance in Brazil as well, Brazilian market grew 48% for the quarter. So that's off to a very positive start. And then our diagnostics business as well. We had 47% growth in our diagnostics business in the quarter. So many of our key growth drivers for the long term performed very well in the quarter, which also then enabled us to raise the guidance for the year. So it's across a number of different of our key strategic growth drivers that enabled us to raise that guidance. In terms of poultry in the U.S., we did see some challenges this quarter as our producer customers did move to some cheaper alternatives from our products. That is something that we'll evaluate through the year. We do expect that there will be a movement back at some point to our products, but that's something that will evolve over time in terms of the efficacy that they see from those cheaper alternatives compared to our more premium products.\nOperator: Our next question is from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: So I wanted to ask you how you think the animal health industry might change post-COVID? And do you still expect a headwind this year? And what have you factored into your guidance for recovery?\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Louise. We look at some of the trends you've seen this year, and a lot of these are more sustainable on the pet care side. And I think the trends, that I'll talk about in a second, are a little bit different on the livestock side. What you've been seeing over the last few quarters is an increase in revenue per visit. That has been sustainable. And as we looked last year at the sort of 10%, again as we talked about in Glenn's remarks, a 10% increase in revenue per visit. And what's been driving that is there's increased pet ownership, and that really has maintained. People are continuing to spend more time with their pets. I think you see the trend of these new pets being adopted by millennials and Gen Z, and they spend more on those pets. So we see that as a trend that will continue to drive growth overall for the industry. And then these pets will ultimately age. And as these -- all these new pets age, a lot of our chronic products will become even more relevant. I think this is also driving important growth in our diagnostics business, which grew 47% in the quarter. Again, pets can't tell you what's wrong with them, so I think vets are getting really increased focus on doing diagnostic tests in a lot of these wellness visits. If you think about livestock, I mean there's two trends to look at. One is just when we produce more protein as people go out more, really what you're going to need to see to be significant improvements here globally as an increase in travel and entertainment. And I think we're now seeing people going back to school, maybe going back to work, maybe traveling from personal. But getting that travel and entertainment industry back up will help drive the growth in livestock globally, I think, over some of these coming quarters. So slightly different trends, but we continue to remain bullish. And the way we see our growth is with an increasing pet care business. We see great growth in pet care from everything from our in line, our products, our derm, our new mabs. Looking at increased growth in China and Brazil, which again as we talked about, we think is sustainable. And then lastly, continued investment in growth in our diagnostics business, which we're quite excited about.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kreger: Question about Librela, Now that, that product is launched in the EU. Can you talk a little bit more about the clinical differentiation you're seeing compared to some of the existing oral alternatives?\nKristin Peck: Sure. We're -- as you probably know, we began the early experience in the EU, and we'll be launching formally in Q2 for Librela. The early experience information that we saw was really, really positive. Both -- obviously it's got a strong safety profile. But the efficacy, it's working very quickly faster than I think some of our customers expected. And they're seeing significant improvements in the quality of life and in the pain of these dogs. So we remain very bullish that customers are looking for an alternative to the products in the market right now. And we've seen a really strong uptake in that. This is still a significant market. If you look at sort of $90 million in the EU today, 40% of those dogs have OA, and currently only 28% of those are treated. So the early experience data that we've seen to date and the early launch makes us very optimistic for the success of this product. And as we mentioned before, we expect this product to be a blockbuster.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahed.\nDavid Westenberg: So can you remind us why there's such species-by-species differences in the U.S. and international livestock market, given that protein is inherently global? And then for my second question on the diagnostic portfolio, I think you confirmed 46%. That is a huge number. So can you talk about the components of growth of that, and if some of that in the kind of the organic growth rate there?\nKristin Peck: Okay. I'll take the first question, and then Glenn can take the second one. Although protein is global, the dynamics are very different in each species in a few ways. One, obviously if you look at consumption, as people move into the middle class they're generally starting with milk and then eggs then poultry. Then they move up to swine and then beef. There's also differences geographically on what people consume. Obviously, China is a huge swine market. That's not true in the U.S. where you see probably more poultry and beef. So there are really different consumption trends as well. The other real big differences is who produces in each market in each species, how much is exported. In the U.S., there's a significantly larger export market for poultry and for swine. So there's very different dynamics for each of the different species as people trade up and trade down different protein sources. As you think about where people are sourcing those processors who are big export markets versus internal production. So -- and it does lead to very different dynamics. The other major dynamic you should think about is that the ability for each producer to change their supply is actually quite different. Once you have a supply of cattle, they take many years to grow. You can't all of a sudden pare back in cattle. Poultry producers can decide not to use a bunch of eggs and grow chickens, which only take a few months. So it's very different in their ability to react to the market, and therefore you do see different decisions being made. And you probably saw in the papers today, there's huge demand for poultry right now, and I think poultry producers are going to have to sort of start scaling up. They can do that quickly. They can make those decisions and expand their flocks very quickly. That is a very difficult thing, it takes a lot of time for a swine or a cattle producer. So that's why you sometimes see some of these different dynamics across species.\nGlenn David: And regarding diagnostics, a very strong quarter for our diagnostics portfolio. We grew 47% in the quarter overall. And that growth was really balanced from many different areas. So we saw the U.S. grew 59% in the quarter in diagnostics, with strong growth in our consumables really pulling through the increased instrument placements that we saw last year really drove increased consumables in the quarter. Also strong performance for our reference lab business and increased growth in our instrument revenue as well. So really strong performance in the U.S. And also for the U.S., it was an easier comparative period to Q1 of last year as well. International, very positive growth as well, growth of 24%, again really driven by strong growth in consumable usage in the international markets as well as increased instrument revenue as well. So very balanced strong growth in our diagnostics portfolio in the quarter. And we think that sets us up well for the year, and we do expect that our diagnostics business will outpace the growth of the overall diagnostics market in 2021.\nOperator: Our next question is from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nElliot Wilbur: A question for Glenn and Kristin, I guess with respect to expectations of additional competition on Trio and in the derm portfolio, I mean what's changed in terms of your line of sight there, based on specific feedback from the channel or just the absence of any competitive noise, whatsoever? And then quick question for Glenn, just thinking about SG&A trends over the balance of the year. I mean the guidance at the midpoint on SG&A and the top line implies roughly a 300 basis point step up. How much of that is just sort of increase in normalized baseline expenditure versus targeted investment spend? And how should we be thinking about the progression of SG&A levels over the balance of the year, relative to some of the investment programs that you have budgeted?\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Elliot. I'll take the first question. Yes, as Glenn mentioned in his opening remarks, we are not expecting competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or for our derm portfolio, Apoquel or Cytopoint, until maybe mid- -- the second half of 2022 at the earliest, to be honest with you. This is just based on our competitive intelligence, which is, as we said from the start, is not perfect. There is not great information, but we definitely don't expect it this year. And based on what we've heard, we don't think it's in the first half of next year at the earliest. So again, we are always prepared for competition to come. We're never exactly clear when it will be. But I think our -- we're very optimistic that we -- the very least this year in the e first half of next year. And we'll be aggressive in growing these products as we've seen.But I would remind you, certainly if you look at Simparica Trio, that we've done incredibly well with Simparica, and it was the third to market. And we continue to grow this franchise already around the world, the Simparica franchise even with other competitors on the market. So anything you want to add there, Glenn? Do you want to take the second question?\nGlenn David: No, I'll move to the second question in terms of the OpEx spend and what we there are a number of different areas that are driving the incremental OpEx this year. Part of it is a normalization from the COVID impact in 2020. We would expect that T&E expenditures would begin to increase, particularly in the second half of the year. But also our compensation costs as we ramped up hiring some positions that may have been on hold, with the impact of COVID, were just more difficult to fill. We are increasing our hiring really to support the strength of many of our key brands and to continue the growth there. From a DTC spending perspective, we would expect more DTC spending this year driven by a couple of different factors. A, we have some Simparica Trio on the market for the full year. So we will support that with advertising expenditures for the full year as well. And we also continue to see strong growth in many of our brands, such as our dermatology portfolio, and will continue to increase and support those brands those brands of direct-to-consumer advertising, not only in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. as well where we are increasing our DTC spend behind many of our brands, including Simparica as well as our dermatology portfolio. So there are a number of areas will spend really to support the significant revenue growth opportunities that we see not only for this year but for many years beyond.\nOperator: Our next question is from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Just two for me on following up on Librela, could you maybe give us some thoughts around the gross margin impact of the 40 to 60 pound price points that they're introduced at? And what's your internal expectations around usage of this product? How do you see it evolving? While recommendation is once a month injection, so one. Two, on ASF, in the past you have been quiet about ASF vaccines. We saw news flows recently that started some trials and collaborating on it. So could you maybe take us through your -- what the time lines around the trials are? And when do you expect to be a part of the ASF vaccine program?\nGlenn David: Sure. So from a Librela gross margin perspective, I'll start with pricing for Librela, which is very important in terms of the overall profitability of the product. Now that we've launched in the EU, we have priced that product at a premium to the current therapies on the market, really consistent with some of the other products that have brought significant innovation in some of our other categories, such as dermatology. You would see Librela price at a premium similar to that. So we would expect that Librela will be a high-margin products consistent with the overall companion portfolio, which typically is above our overall gross margin level. So that will be a positive contributor to gross margin over time. In terms of ASF and our development for vaccines, as we've said before, this is a very complicated disease state. It's going to take many years to find a solution. We are active in those development studies, but it will be a multiyear time frame before we find a solution for African swine fever.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nKathy Miner: Two questions, please, first on Librela. Can you clarify, I believe in your comments you said that you expected approval of Librela later in the U.S. than Solensia? Does this reflect just filing timing? Or is there some other dynamic here? And the second question, a little bigger picture on business development, it seems Zoetis has been pretty quiet in terms of M&A this year. Can you comment a little bit about your outlook for the rest of 2021 and some of the areas you may be focusing on there?\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Kathy. Yes, as we mentioned, we are expecting the approval of both Librela and Solensia in 2022. And if there's nothing specific about why Librela is actually later than month. It has to do with filing timings and just general process on the 2 of those. But again, we remain quite confident and optimistic in the approval of both of those. And as we get closer, we'll be able to provide more specific guidance on revenue and launch timing, et cetera. But no, there's nothing specific as to why Librela is going to probably be later in the year than Solensia. it's just timing of submissions and back and forth with the regulators. So Glenn, do you want to take the second?\nGlenn David: Yes. So from an M&A perspective and our areas of focus for 2021, so build development remains a key area and part of our capital allocation strategy, and we remain focused on that. A couple of areas that we continue to pursue, consistent with what we've discussed in the past, is any specific geography where we may have an opportunity to gain additional share or presence in an area, that we may not be at the level of market share that we are globally. Those are areas that we will continue to focus on and look to bring in additional products into our portfolio. Also, many of the areas that we've stressed as areas of strategic importance to us, whether that's in areas such as precision livestock farming, genetics, diagnostics. Those are areas that we'll also continue to remain focused on as well as if there are only development assets as well that we believe would bring strength of our R&D portfolio, we can generate greater value than the existing company. So we remain focused on M&A. We evaluate many opportunities, and we will look to continue to use that as a prime area for capital allocation moving forward.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Risinger: So congrats on the exceptional performance. I think you hear my 6-year-old puppy in the background barking, and I'm wondering if you have a barking consumption. Anyway, so I wanted to just move little bit a if my phone line cut out. So could you provide additional details on companion animal innovation prospects beyond monoclonal antibodies for pain? It'd be helpful to understand areas of unmet need and the potential cadence of material new companion animal product introductions in coming years. And I know that you can only comment on this at a high level, but anything you can offer would be helpful. And then second, given likely inflationary pressures ahead on costs, what is your plan for product price increases in companion animal and livestock?\nKristin Peck: We are quite excited with regards to our innovative portfolio in both companion and livestock. And as you think about companion animal, we're really focused on continuing to grow our franchise in parasiticide and look for additional products there. Continuing to look at exciting areas such as additional add-ons in our dermatology portfolio. And really, we think the platform of our monoclonal antibodies goes way beyond pain, to be honest with you. There's lots of other chronic and other conditions. We think that technology will help with and super excited about our portfolio in diagnostics. Really building new indications with our images platform, our AI, cloud-based diagnostics expanding reference lab. So I think there's a really bright future as we look at continuing to expand our pet care portfolio globally. So Glenn, I don't know if you want to take the question with regards to inflation.\nGlenn David: Yes. With regards to inflation and the impact in -- we'll have on pricing across our portfolio, so we do expect over the long-term to continue to be able to take price increases ranging from 2% to 3% per year. This year will be a little muted in 2021 because of the impact of the DRAXXIN LOE. But beyond this year, we do expect to be able to return to that 2% to 3% average pricing. That will vary based on the product as well as the geography. Typically, in our more innovative products, we're able to take a little bit above that 2% to 3%. Products that have been on the market a little longer generally get a little below that 2% to 3%. And then in higher inflationary markets, we typically take pricing beyond that 2% to 3%. So we don't see any significant changes to that in the short to medium term, other than the fact that in 2021 because of the impact of the DRAXXIN LOE, we'll be below that 2% to 3%.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Maybe going back to the launch of Librela and Solensia in Europe. I guess Kristin the -- given your experience with the kind of early feedback from vets, I mean has that changed your expectations around what the launch curves could look like? Because these are kind of new products to treat pain. So just wanted to get your kind of updated thoughts on what you think kind of uptake will look like? And should we think about the launch curve maybe similar to the derm portfolio, kind of given that both of these therapies were relatively kind of innovative at their launch?\nKristin Peck: Thanks, yes. I think we are very bullish with regards to the launch curves of both Librela and Solensia in the EU. I think we're now just in early experience with Solensia, so it's probably a little earlier there. But again, as we said I think a little bit previously, I do think the launch curves are going to look different between Librela and Solensia a little bit. Librela is going to enter an established market. The great news is the vets are already very comfortable with injectable monoclonal antibodies even Cytopoint. So I think you'll see a really nice uptick, and I think we'll do very well there. Solensia is a little different. You have to get more cats to the clinic. You have to medicalize those cats and treat them. It's a little harder to sense OA in cats. That being said, we'll have a much better sense as we get to the next quarter since we're just beginning early experience right now. We're really bullish on this in the medium term how fast that uptake happened. I think early experience, which is what we're in right now, we'll be able to better inform that as we get to the next quarter. But the science behind it, the safety, the efficacy is really, really strong. And what's different, as we've talked about for Solensia, there really are very few alternatives for cats. So if we can build a market, which I think Zoetis has demonstrated its ability to do, we're really excited about what that launch curve will be better informed as we finish early experience, which we're adjusted now. Anything you add on that one?\nGlenn David: No, I just echo what you said, Kristin. I'm very excited by the feedback that we saw with the early experience program. It does give us even greater confidence and more enthusiasm around the potential for these products in the EU and globally. And we're continuing to update our forecast based on the feedback that we get.\nOperator: And our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: A couple of ones here. Just on Trio, I guess with competition not expected until the second half of '22, does that change how you're thinking about kind of peak market share potential for the product, given you have this kind of three-year window to really establish yourself in the market prior to seeing any type of real competition here? And then second, I know you talked -- touched on this a little bit before, but so on livestock in general. It seems like we're for a very strong start of the year. I know part of that is DRAXXIN. But with reopenings seeming to go pretty well in most markets so far, are you feeling better about these markets than the beginning of the year? Or are you still a bit cautious, just given kind of some of the -- I guess uneven openings that we're seeing across the world?\nKristin Peck: I'll start and let Glenn build on this. We are very optimistic on Trio, and ultimately it probably changes the curve a little bit of how fast we get that competition on the market. But I think it's important, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, these products still grow even when competition enters. And I think this is something we keep underscoring. When compared to there to market. It is growing like crazy and taking share. I think when you put the marketing muscle, the technical experience muscle of Zoetis behind the product. Even with competition, we still expect these products to grow. So we will probably build our share faster but we do expect even with competition that these products in these categories will continue to grow also bringing more people into prescription products versus some of the over the cattle, really bringing new solutions I think we'll continue to grow these products in the longer term. I don't know if you want to build anything that and address the life back one.\nGlenn David: Yes. No, just to say, obviously the longer out in the market alone, the better in terms of accelerating that peak sales curve. But to Kristin's point, this is a very large market, and we do see products on the market and franchises on the market that are approaching $1 billion today, even without a triple therapy in the U.S. So we think there is significant opportunity for future growth for this franchise. In terms of livestock, we are off to a strong start, and we do think that the reopening trends are positive for the overall animal health industry and the growth in livestock. We're also very pleased with the performance that we've seen in many of our key markets, particularly outside of the U.S. markets such as China and Brazil and what we've been able to accomplish there. And we expect those trends to continue to be very positive. Obviously, we do have some dynamics, particularly to our portfolio within livestock with the impact of DRAXXIN. But overall the fundamentals in the industry are remaining positive. Profitability is up for many of our producers, which is also very encouraging for the overall industry, and we think will be positive for the longer-term outlook for livestock.\nOperator: Next question is from Greg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nGreg Fraser : It's Greg Fraser on for Greg Gilbert. On international livestock, obviously very robust growth in the quarter. And you spoke to the dynamics in China and some other markets. As the strong demand trends for the overall business continued in the second quarter? And how are you thinking about growth for international livestock for the full year?\nKristin Peck: Yes. So just when you look at our overall livestock portfolio globally, we grew about 8% this quarter. As you mentioned, that was really driven by the international growth of 17%. As we said in our February call, we do expect that globally, the livestock business will grow in the low single digits. That hasn't changed materially based on the strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. So with that growth, we would expect international livestock to grow more rapidly than the U.S., really driven by the dynamics with China and Brazil, but still expecting low single-digit growth for our livestock business for the year.\nOperator: Navaan Ty with Citi. Please go ahead.\nNavaan Ty: Actually, my question has been partly answered this. Could you comment on maybe the pet ownership and the average revenue per companion animal going forward and longer term? And remember, we expected growth to moderate once we all return to the office. Do you have updated thoughts on that front?\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks. As you think about pet care, we've been having a few quarters with 10% or higher revenue per visit. That has been -- continued to be sustained. We think the trends driving this is the increased pet ownership, which hasn't changed. There was a little bit of a fear, as we were in Q3 of last year with a lot of these dogs being returned or cats returned or re-homed, and we really haven't seen a significant trend there. So we think the increased pet ownership even if people go back to work, most people are going to have flexible arrangements. They're still going to be home with their pet more than probably they were before. And they build a bond with those pets and they notice things and they build habits that we think will be sustained as we do that. And again, the other important trend here is who is owning these pets? Millennials and Gen Z, who tend to spend more pet. So we really continue to see pet ownership trends and spend for pet continuing. I mean is it going to be 10% every quarter? I'm not so sure. But historically just to remind you, I think it was 5% to 6% historically. So it's still a very strong growth driver overall for the industry, and I think these trends may be higher than what it historically has been on a go-forward basis, just given who's adopting the pets and increased focus on the pet is an important part of the family.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Steinberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Steinberg: I just had one question to follow up on potential Trio competition. A year ago, you were expecting competition I think the second half of this year. And then you pushed it into next year and now second half of next year. And so just curious, I know you said you have limited visibility, but what do you think the sources of the delay might be? Would it be technical manufacturing or formulation issues or heightened regulatory issues, delays in inspection or FDA looking for different things. Just curious since you initially thought it would be relatively soon, what could be the technical and regulatory issues surrounding the potential delay in the launch of competitive.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, David. I have to say you have a very good list there of potential reasons. I mean the honest answer is we don't really know why there are specific delays? And are they dissimilar delays for different companies. It's very difficult for us to assess that. There's not a lot of great details information. So I mean our list of the ones that we consider were all the ones you just mentioned, to be perfectly honest. But which one it is for which company? I'm not really sure. I mean some -- maybe because they launched their first litter, for example, one of the companies. But for the others, it's not exactly clear exactly what is driving those delays. So I wish I could be a little more helpful here, but honestly we don't really know.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to our speakers for any closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Okay. Well, thanks for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. We look forward to keeping you updated as our business throughout the year and continue to deliver our results and innovations that you and our customers expect. So thanks so much. And stay well, everybody.\nOperator: And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy and able to get vaccinated for COVID-19, if not already, then soon. We've been very fortunate in the U.S. as vaccination rates are up and infection rates are trending down overall. But that is not the situation everywhere. In many countries, improving access to vaccines and controlling infection rates are critical hurdles for a more comprehensive global recovery. Yet with the extraordinary measures being taken by so many, I remain optimistic about the steady progress we're making to beat this pandemic. I'm also very proud of what we've been able to do at Zoetis and our own small way to support the global effort. We've been able to keep our colleagues safe, encourage and assist them with vaccinations where possible, and continue serving our customers in the care of their animals. And we're off to a very strong start in 2021, executing on strategies for building on our innovative pet care portfolio, expanding in key markets by the U.S. and accelerating our growth in diagnostics. In the first quarter, we grew our top line revenue at 21% operationally, our best quarter ever, with 25% operational growth internationally and 19% growth in the U.S. China and Brazil led our international performance with 75% and 48% operational growth respectively, exhibiting their strength in both companion animal and livestock product sales. In total, our companion animal portfolio grew 34% operationally based on the strength of our parasiticide and dermatology products, while our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally with solid growth in cattle, swine and fish products. Digging deeper on pet care, it has been one year since the launch of our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio. It is exceeding expectations and has been well received by customers, with a-90% plus penetration rate in our largest U. S. corporate accounts. Simparica Trio is the latest growth catalyst for a portfolio of small animal parasiticides. After several successful innovations in the last few years, these products made up 16% of our total sales in the first quarter and includes such brands as Simparica, Simparica Trio, Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart. We believe the ongoing market shift to e-commerce is another boost for this category, helping to increase compliance and months on therapy. And our direct-to-consumer campaigns for Simparica and Simparica Trio continued showing a solid return on investment in markets around the world. Meanwhile, our key dermatology portfolio led by Apoquel and Cytopoint, demonstrated continued double-digit growth. We are seeing excellent traction and significant growth of off the range international markets. Our dermatology portfolio has further growth potential as we continue expanding our international customer base and seek to become a more common first-line treatment for osteoarthritis in dogs. Veterinarians and pet owners alike appreciate the exceptional standard of care that our products can provide. In the companion animal space, we also continue to be pleased with our diagnostics portfolio, which grew 47% operationally in the first quarter. We have grown our point-of-care diagnostic sales made excellent progress on improving our connectivity solutions in veterinary practices, and have seen our cloud-based VetScan Imagyst platform receiving very positive customer feedback, with placements exceeding expectations in the early launch. We're also making progress on our reference labs integrations and look forward to future expansions in this space, both in the U.S. and internationally. Our growth in livestock was driven by the performance of cattle, swine and fish in the first quarter. Cattle product sales in the U.S. were strong as the food service sector has started to recover and generic competition for DRAXXIN was later than expected. Meanwhile, swine benefited from the continued recovery from African swine fever in China. Thanks to the unprecedented growth in revenue and our continued financial discipline and adaptability throughout COVID-19. Our adjusted net income 3%, 4% operationally. Looking ahead we are leading guidance for operational growth and full year revenue to the range of 10. 5% to 12%. And while we had an unusually strong first quarter, we expect more normalized revenue growth in the second half of the year due to tougher comparative quarters and increasing generic competition for DRAXXIN. Glenn will provide more details on other guidance updates in his remarks. Since the beginning of the year, Zoetis has continued to advance our key priorities, including key milestones for new products and life cycle innovations and geographic expansions for major brands. Since our last earnings announcement, we received approval in the European Union for Solensia the first injectable monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and will be launching this year. Osteoarthritis is vastly underdiagnosed and undertreated today due to limited options for therapy and difficulty recognizing pain in cats. Meanwhile, Librela, our monoclonal antibody for the alleviation of OA pain in dogs, has launched in the EU. And we're seeing a great customer response from vets and dogs owners who referenced increased activity, social ability and quality of life for their pets. In the U.S., we continued discussions with the FDA regarding our regulatory submissions and manufacturing inspection for Librela and Solensia, and we now anticipate approvals for both products in 2022, with Librela likely later in the year. We will provide updates on U.S. revenue expectations for these products in 2022 as we get further clarity on approval timing and rollout plans. It is also worth noting that in China, which is our second largest market in terms of revenue, Zoetis recently received approvals for several leading products, Fostera PCV MH a 1-shot vaccine for pigs, Excenel RTU EZ, a key anti-infective for cattle and swine, and Revolution Plus, our latest parasiticide for cats. We continue to strengthen our portfolio in China, one of our key catalysts for growth. We're also maximizing our key brands with more geographic expansion. In poultry, we expanded our line of recombinant vector vaccines with approval of Poulvac Procerta HVT ND in Canada, Brazil and several other smaller markets. And in parasiticide, we received additional approvals for Simparica Trio in Japan, Mexico and several other smaller markets. In terms of sustainability, we published our long-term goals in March with specific commitments to continuities, animals and the planet. We've built a comprehensive and rigorous approach through our Driven to Care program, and our goals include support for 10 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We'll be releasing more detail on these goals and our initial progress in our sustainability report this June. In closing, the fundamental growth drivers for our industry continue to show strong and sustainable momentum. Pet adoption trends and higher spending per visit in the U. S. along with increased medicalization rates in markets outside the U.S. all continue to bode well for significant growth in our companion animal and diagnostic portfolios globally. We feel very confident about where our companion animal business has come over the last few years, launching innovative new products, defining new standards of treatment and expanding our global reach. In 2014, our companion animal business was 34% of our total revenue. Last year, it had grown to 55% based on the strength of our innovation and investment in growth, and we see that continuing to expand. In livestock, the industry is in a more limited innovation cycle, and we expect modest growth for the year. Livestock growth is tied closely to the pandemic and how quickly the foodservice industry recovers. For Zoetis, we also anticipate increasing headwinds of generic competition to DRAXXIN, but we expect our life cycle innovation and competitive strategies to help us mitigate the impact. While U.S. livestock may present challenges for us in the near term, I feel very positive about our catalysts for growth in pet care, diagnostics and international markets like China and Brazil. We continue to be led by our companion animal parasiticide and dermatology portfolio with more growth to come, and we see a bright future ahead for our monoclonal antibodies for pain.  Diagnostics is accelerating its growth as we increase our global footprint, expand our reference labs and demonstrates the potential for VetScan images to veterinary clinics. And internationally, China continues to be a market with significant growth potential, not only in swine products but with a sizable opportunity for increased medicalization of pets. And we expect major growth to continue in Brazil across the companion animal and livestock portfolios. As always, we remain confident that Zoetis' diverse portfolio across products and geographies, our continued pipeline of innovative new products and life cycle innovations, and the agility and commitment of our colleagues will continue driving our success in 2021 and beyond. Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our first quarter results and updated guidance for the full year 2021. Sure. Thanks, Erin. As you think about U.S. livestock, as Glenn mentioned, overall U.S. livestock was down 4%, but there was lots of different trends in there. U.S. cattle was up 6% in the quarter. And I think if you look at that, that was driven by later-than-expected entrants in the generics. So we were expecting more entrants sooner. But to your point, we don't really think it's going to end up playing out any differently by the end. And so what do I mean by that? If you look at that, we think the entrants will come, we think once they do, we'll likely end up -- if you look at generics, it's certainly 20% to 40% on penetration. And what we said is we think that's likely what it's going to be with DRAXXIN, both in the U.S. and in the EU and really around the globe. But as you think about that, it's likely going to happen a little bit later in the year. So we did do better in the beginning of the year. But if you look at that and you compare it to how we did internationally on DRAXXIN more specifically, so although you saw 6% growth in DRAXXIN in the U.S. internationally -- sorry I meant overall DRAXXIN internationally is actually down, and that was because we did have a multiple entrants sooner in that. So I don't think livestock really is going to play out any differently. We did see, as Glenn mentioned, a decline in poultry overall. And there is some seasonality obviously if you think about cattle. Swine was down and poultry. But overall I think we continue to remind, if you look at livestock overall for us, it was up 8%. I think what often people underappreciate it is that 60% of livestock is outside of the U.S. And although we focus a lot on U.S. cattle, the growth as you saw in China across swine which had 128% growth, and in Brazil still meant livestock did quite well. As you think about the parasiticides, I'll let Glenn sort of take some of that and get into some of the more specific trends. Thanks. Thanks, Mike. So starting with China, and I'll let Glenn take the second question. We do think this is a very sustainable growth driver in China, and really what drives that is a few things. One, I think you'll see African swine fever continuing a rebuild of the herd there. It is going to take a few years to rebuild that, so I think that is going to be for the next few years of sustainable growth. You saw swine grow in the quarter at 128%. But I think what's also really important to focus on is how well companion animal did, which grew 59%. We've been launching a number of new products, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. We had the launch of Fostera PCV MH as well as Revolution Plus. So continuing to bring in new products, seeing really, really good growth across both companion animal and livestock, makes us believe that China and the investments we've even talked about in building additional facilities there and growing our biologics footprint, we are very bullish on China continuing to be a sustainable growth driver for the company. Do you want to take the question onwards? Sure. Thanks, Louise. We look at some of the trends you've seen this year, and a lot of these are more sustainable on the pet care side. And I think the trends, that I'll talk about in a second, are a little bit different on the livestock side. What you've been seeing over the last few quarters is an increase in revenue per visit. That has been sustainable. And as we looked last year at the sort of 10%, again as we talked about in Glenn's remarks, a 10% increase in revenue per visit. And what's been driving that is there's increased pet ownership, and that really has maintained. People are continuing to spend more time with their pets. I think you see the trend of these new pets being adopted by millennials and Gen Z, and they spend more on those pets. So we see that as a trend that will continue to drive growth overall for the industry. And then these pets will ultimately age. And as these -- all these new pets age, a lot of our chronic products will become even more relevant. I think this is also driving important growth in our diagnostics business, which grew 47% in the quarter. Again, pets can't tell you what's wrong with them, so I think vets are getting really increased focus on doing diagnostic tests in a lot of these wellness visits. If you think about livestock, I mean there's two trends to look at. One is just when we produce more protein as people go out more, really what you're going to need to see to be significant improvements here globally as an increase in travel and entertainment. And I think we're now seeing people going back to school, maybe going back to work, maybe traveling from personal. But getting that travel and entertainment industry back up will help drive the growth in livestock globally, I think, over some of these coming quarters. So slightly different trends, but we continue to remain bullish. And the way we see our growth is with an increasing pet care business. We see great growth in pet care from everything from our in line, our products, our derm, our new mabs. Looking at increased growth in China and Brazil, which again as we talked about, we think is sustainable. And then lastly, continued investment in growth in our diagnostics business, which we're quite excited about. Sure. We're -- as you probably know, we began the early experience in the EU, and we'll be launching formally in Q2 for Librela. The early experience information that we saw was really, really positive. Both -- obviously it's got a strong safety profile. But the efficacy, it's working very quickly faster than I think some of our customers expected. And they're seeing significant improvements in the quality of life and in the pain of these dogs. So we remain very bullish that customers are looking for an alternative to the products in the market right now. And we've seen a really strong uptake in that. This is still a significant market. If you look at sort of $90 million in the EU today, 40% of those dogs have OA, and currently only 28% of those are treated. So the early experience data that we've seen to date and the early launch makes us very optimistic for the success of this product. And as we mentioned before, we expect this product to be a blockbuster. Okay. I'll take the first question, and then Glenn can take the second one. Although protein is global, the dynamics are very different in each species in a few ways. One, obviously if you look at consumption, as people move into the middle class they're generally starting with milk and then eggs then poultry. Then they move up to swine and then beef. There's also differences geographically on what people consume. Obviously, China is a huge swine market. That's not true in the U.S. where you see probably more poultry and beef. So there are really different consumption trends as well. The other real big differences is who produces in each market in each species, how much is exported. In the U.S., there's a significantly larger export market for poultry and for swine. So there's very different dynamics for each of the different species as people trade up and trade down different protein sources. As you think about where people are sourcing those processors who are big export markets versus internal production. So -- and it does lead to very different dynamics. The other major dynamic you should think about is that the ability for each producer to change their supply is actually quite different. Once you have a supply of cattle, they take many years to grow. You can't all of a sudden pare back in cattle. Poultry producers can decide not to use a bunch of eggs and grow chickens, which only take a few months. So it's very different in their ability to react to the market, and therefore you do see different decisions being made. And you probably saw in the papers today, there's huge demand for poultry right now, and I think poultry producers are going to have to sort of start scaling up. They can do that quickly. They can make those decisions and expand their flocks very quickly. That is a very difficult thing, it takes a lot of time for a swine or a cattle producer. So that's why you sometimes see some of these different dynamics across species. Sure. Thanks, Elliot. I'll take the first question. Yes, as Glenn mentioned in his opening remarks, we are not expecting competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or for our derm portfolio, Apoquel or Cytopoint, until maybe mid- -- the second half of 2022 at the earliest, to be honest with you. This is just based on our competitive intelligence, which is, as we said from the start, is not perfect. There is not great information, but we definitely don't expect it this year. And based on what we've heard, we don't think it's in the first half of next year at the earliest. So again, we are always prepared for competition to come. We're never exactly clear when it will be. But I think our -- we're very optimistic that we -- the very least this year in the e first half of next year. And we'll be aggressive in growing these products as we've seen.But I would remind you, certainly if you look at Simparica Trio, that we've done incredibly well with Simparica, and it was the third to market. And we continue to grow this franchise already around the world, the Simparica franchise even with other competitors on the market. So anything you want to add there, Glenn? Do you want to take the second question? Thanks, Kathy. Yes, as we mentioned, we are expecting the approval of both Librela and Solensia in 2022. And if there's nothing specific about why Librela is actually later than month. It has to do with filing timings and just general process on the 2 of those. But again, we remain quite confident and optimistic in the approval of both of those. And as we get closer, we'll be able to provide more specific guidance on revenue and launch timing, et cetera. But no, there's nothing specific as to why Librela is going to probably be later in the year than Solensia. it's just timing of submissions and back and forth with the regulators. So Glenn, do you want to take the second? We are quite excited with regards to our innovative portfolio in both companion and livestock. And as you think about companion animal, we're really focused on continuing to grow our franchise in parasiticide and look for additional products there. Continuing to look at exciting areas such as additional add-ons in our dermatology portfolio. And really, we think the platform of our monoclonal antibodies goes way beyond pain, to be honest with you. There's lots of other chronic and other conditions. We think that technology will help with and super excited about our portfolio in diagnostics. Really building new indications with our images platform, our AI, cloud-based diagnostics expanding reference lab. So I think there's a really bright future as we look at continuing to expand our pet care portfolio globally. So Glenn, I don't know if you want to take the question with regards to inflation. Thanks, yes. I think we are very bullish with regards to the launch curves of both Librela and Solensia in the EU. I think we're now just in early experience with Solensia, so it's probably a little earlier there. But again, as we said I think a little bit previously, I do think the launch curves are going to look different between Librela and Solensia a little bit. Librela is going to enter an established market. The great news is the vets are already very comfortable with injectable monoclonal antibodies even Cytopoint. So I think you'll see a really nice uptick, and I think we'll do very well there. Solensia is a little different. You have to get more cats to the clinic. You have to medicalize those cats and treat them. It's a little harder to sense OA in cats. That being said, we'll have a much better sense as we get to the next quarter since we're just beginning early experience right now. We're really bullish on this in the medium term how fast that uptake happened. I think early experience, which is what we're in right now, we'll be able to better inform that as we get to the next quarter. But the science behind it, the safety, the efficacy is really, really strong. And what's different, as we've talked about for Solensia, there really are very few alternatives for cats. So if we can build a market, which I think Zoetis has demonstrated its ability to do, we're really excited about what that launch curve will be better informed as we finish early experience, which we're adjusted now. Anything you add on that one? I'll start and let Glenn build on this. We are very optimistic on Trio, and ultimately it probably changes the curve a little bit of how fast we get that competition on the market. But I think it's important, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, these products still grow even when competition enters. And I think this is something we keep underscoring. When compared to there to market. It is growing like crazy and taking share. I think when you put the marketing muscle, the technical experience muscle of Zoetis behind the product. Even with competition, we still expect these products to grow. So we will probably build our share faster but we do expect even with competition that these products in these categories will continue to grow also bringing more people into prescription products versus some of the over the cattle, really bringing new solutions I think we'll continue to grow these products in the longer term. I don't know if you want to build anything that and address the life back one. Yes. So just when you look at our overall livestock portfolio globally, we grew about 8% this quarter. As you mentioned, that was really driven by the international growth of 17%. As we said in our February call, we do expect that globally, the livestock business will grow in the low single digits. That hasn't changed materially based on the strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. So with that growth, we would expect international livestock to grow more rapidly than the U.S., really driven by the dynamics with China and Brazil, but still expecting low single-digit growth for our livestock business for the year. Sure. Thanks. As you think about pet care, we've been having a few quarters with 10% or higher revenue per visit. That has been -- continued to be sustained. We think the trends driving this is the increased pet ownership, which hasn't changed. There was a little bit of a fear, as we were in Q3 of last year with a lot of these dogs being returned or cats returned or re-homed, and we really haven't seen a significant trend there. So we think the increased pet ownership even if people go back to work, most people are going to have flexible arrangements. They're still going to be home with their pet more than probably they were before. And they build a bond with those pets and they notice things and they build habits that we think will be sustained as we do that. And again, the other important trend here is who is owning these pets? Millennials and Gen Z, who tend to spend more pet. So we really continue to see pet ownership trends and spend for pet continuing. I mean is it going to be 10% every quarter? I'm not so sure. But historically just to remind you, I think it was 5% to 6% historically. So it's still a very strong growth driver overall for the industry, and I think these trends may be higher than what it historically has been on a go-forward basis, just given who's adopting the pets and increased focus on the pet is an important part of the family. Thanks, David. I have to say you have a very good list there of potential reasons. I mean the honest answer is we don't really know why there are specific delays? And are they dissimilar delays for different companies. It's very difficult for us to assess that. There's not a lot of great details information. So I mean our list of the ones that we consider were all the ones you just mentioned, to be perfectly honest. But which one it is for which company? I'm not really sure.

            "name": "Glenn David",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year, delivering substantial growth on a global basis and across species and therapeutic areas. Today, I'll focus my comments on our first quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance, and an update on our improved full year 2021 guidance. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $1.9 billion, growing 22% on a reported basis and 21% operationally. Adjusted net income of $603 million was an increase of 33% of on a reported basis and 34% operationally. Operational revenue grew 21%, resulting entirely from volume increases with price flat for the quarter. Volume growth of 21% includes 13% from other in line products, 5% from new products, and 3% from key dermatology products. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 34% operationally, with livestock growing 8% operationally in the quarter. Performance in companion animal was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., certain European markets, Canada, Australia and Mexico. We also saw growth in our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, as well as in small animal vaccines and diagnostics. Following blockbuster sales in year one, Simparica Trio begin 2021 with strong first quarter performance, posting revenue of $90 million, growing sequentially each quarter since launch. The underlying dynamics that drove first quarter sales are very favorable for significant future growth, such as increasing clinic penetration and robust reordering rates within penetrated clinics. I'd again like to mention how pleased we are with the performance of our broader parasiticide portfolio which, in addition to the Simparica franchise, had significant growth in the Revolution, Stronghold and ProHeart franchises as well. U.S. market share within the flea, tick and heartworm segment is now at an all-time high of 31%, representing an increase of more than 9% for the first quarter versus the same period in the prior year. Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $245 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally. We remain confident that key dermatology sales will exceed $1 billion this year. Our diagnostics portfolio grew 47% in Q1, led by increases in consumable and instrument revenue. 2020 presented challenging conditions for our diagnostics business, as social distancing restrictions limited our ability to enter vet clinics and increase our market share. However, our vast product portfolio, commitment to innovation, and ability to leverage the breadth of our medicines and vaccines portfolio has us well positioned to grow faster than the overall diagnostics market. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our cattle and swine businesses. Improving market conditions from the COVID-19 recovery as well as successful promotional activities led to increased sales across the cattle portfolio. In addition, later-than-expected timing of generic entrants led to strong first quarter sales for DRAXXIN. Our swine portfolio grew 19% operationally as large producers continued rebuilding herds as they recover from African swine fever and created significant demand for our products. Poultry sales declined in the first quarter as producers expanded their use of lower-cost alternatives to our premium products. The decline in poultry partially tempered the growth in cattle, swine and fish. Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 19%, with companion animal products growing 32% and livestock sales declining by 4%. For companion animal, pet ownership and pet spending trends remain promising. While severe weather caused a slight decline in vet clinic traffic for the quarter, revenue per visit was up more than 10%. In addition, pet ownership has increased and is trending towards a younger demographic, and younger pet owners typically spend more on pet care. This is a key driver for increased revenue per visit and creates robust demand for our diverse portfolio. Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to companion animal growth, growing 74% in the quarter. Diagnostics, key dermatology products and small animal vaccines also contributed to growth. Simparica Trio continues to perform well in the U.S. with sales of $83 million. The Simparica franchise generated sales of $112 million in the quarter and is now the number two brand in the U.S. flea, tick and heartworm segment. Companion animal diagnostic sales increased 62% in the quarter as the continued recovery at the vet clinic and a favorable prior year comparative period led to significant growth in point-of-care consumable revenue. Key dermatology sales were $157 million for the quarter, growing 16% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. U.S. livestock declined 4% in the quarter, driven primarily by poultry as producers switching to lower-cost alternatives unfavorably impacted our business. Swine also declined in the quarter, which is attributed almost entirely to a favorable nonrecurring government purchase, which occurred in Q1 2020. Cattle grew 6% in the quarter as promotional programs and the timing of generic entrants drove growth across the product portfolio. Growth in cattle partially offset the declines in poultry and swine. To summarize, U.S. performance was once again strong in what remains a very favorable companion animal market environment, in which we offer the broadest and most innovative product portfolio. Although livestock declined in the quarter with expectations of further declines for the year, we are encouraged by a series of foodservice trends such as increased dining out and school and business reopenings. Revenue in our international segment grew 25% operationally in the quarter, with companion animal revenue growing 37% operationally and livestock revenue growing 17% operationally. The strength in companion animal was fueled by the continuing trends of pet adoptions, increasing standard of care by pet owners, and our investments in advertising, all of which drove growth across our parasiticide and dermatology portfolios. Companion animal diagnostics grew 18% in the quarter, led by a 24% increase in point-of-care consumable revenue and a second consecutive quarter of double-digit increase in instrument placement revenue. We began early experience programs for Librela, a monoclonal antibody for alleviation of OA pain in dogs. The feedback from the programs has been extremely positive, and further solidifies our view of the long-term potential of the product with an EU launch currently underway. Our feline monoclonal antibody, Solensia, will begin early experience programs in Q2. And with an EU launch to follow in the third quarter. Solensia will provide cat owners an innovative therapy to address one of the largest unmet needs in animal health. Our international livestock business saw double-digit growth across all species with the exception of poultry, which grew low single digits in the quarter. Swine revenue grew 29% operationally led by growth in China of 128%, marking the third consecutive quarter with swine growth in excess of 100%. While additional outbreaks and strains of African swine fever have occurred, we believe it is contained to a specific region and a limited number of customers. Cattle grew 11% operationally in the quarter as a result of marketing campaigns, key account penetration, and favorable export market conditions in Brazil and several other emerging markets. Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter, growing 39% operationally driven by strong performance in Chile, the timing of seasonal vaccination protocols, and the 2020 acquisition of Fish Vet Group. All major markets grew in the first quarter, many in double digits. China total sales grew 75% operationally, which, in addition to the significant growth in swine, delivered 59% operational growth in companion animal. Brazil grew 48% operationally in the quarter as sales of Simparica, the leading oral parasiticide in the Brazilian market, drove a 73% operational increase in companion animal. Overall, our international segment delivered strong results, again, demonstrating the value of substantial geographic and species diversification. Our companion animal business benefited from favorable trends such as rising medicalization rates outside the U.S. And while swine was the largest growth driver for our international livestock business, the contributions were broad-based with growth across all species. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 71% increased 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year as a result of favorable product mix, partially offset by foreign exchange and other costs, including freight. Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally, resulting from increased compensation-related costs and advertising and promotion expense for Simparica Trio. This was partially offset by reductions to T&E costs as a result of COVID-19. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, an increase of 230 basis points driven by a reduction in favorable discrete items compared to the prior year's comparable quarter, partially offset by the favorable impact of the jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS grew 34% operationally for the quarter, primarily driven by revenue growth. We resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter, repurchasing approximately $180 million worth of shares. Along with our dividend, share repurchase is a critical component of our shareholder distribution strategy. We remain in a strong liquidity position and are highly cash generative. And as a result, we expect to be able to execute on all investment priorities including direct-to-consumer advertising, internal R&D and external business development, while still returning excess cash to shareholders. Now moving on to our updated guidance for 2021, which we are raising as a result of our first quarter performance. Please note that our guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. For revenue, we are raising and narrowing our guidance range, with projected revenue now between $7.5 billion and $7.625 billion and operational revenue growth between 10.5% and 12% for the full year versus the 9% to 11% in our February guidance. Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.12 billion to $2.16 billion, representing operational growth of 12% to 14% compared to our prior guidance of 9% to 12%. Adjusted diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.51, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.08 to $4.19. Our key assumptions for 2021 have not changed materially since the guidance we provided on our Q4 2020 call. However, our current view is that we will not face competition in the U.S. for Simparica Trio or our key view is that we will or our key dermatology products until the second half of 2022. On our fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we anticipated growth to be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, and I'd like to take this time to expand upon that further. We are expecting first half 2021 growth to materially outpace growth in the second half of the year, primarily resulting from Simparica Trio sales and the favorable Q2 2020 comparative period related to COVID-19. Subsequently, we expect growth to moderate in the second half of the year as a result of increased generic competition for DRAXXIN as well as challenging comparative periods when pent-up demand in the first half of 2020 worked its way through the system in the second half. Now to summarize before we move to Q&A, we've delivered strong operational top and bottom line growth in the first quarter with significant gains in both companion animal and livestock and across nearly every therapeutic area and geography. In addition, we raised and narrowed our full year 2021 guidance. And while growth will moderate in the back half of the year for the reasons I outlined, we again expect to grow faster than the market and feel very positive about our position for sustained growth beyond this year. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Yes. So thanks, Erin. So from a parasiticide perspective, we had a really strong quarter with the Simparica franchise, 133% growth in the franchise. Great performance from Simparica Trio with $90 million in the quarter alone, and Simparica also delivering $74 million with 38% growth. In terms of seasonality, we typically do see Q1 and particularly Q2 being the stronger quarters from a parasiticide portfolio perspective, particularly in the U.S. However, as we do see Simparica Trio on a ramp-up curve, the impact of that seasonality may be a little different this year as we do expect to continue to increase our clinic penetration and adoption and market share within the clinics as well. So there definitely is some seasonality within the parasiticide portfolio. But with the continued ramp-up on the product, it may not be as severe as you would typically see with an established product. Yes. And I just want to make other comments on China, Mike, to your other question as well. We did have $123 million in sales. Q1 typically does tend to be the larger quarter of sales for China. So that necessarily isn't one that you would run off of for the rest of the year. But to Kristin's point, I'm very excited about the growth prospects that we have for China for the year. In terms of the OpEx, we grew 8% in OpEx in the first quarter, which is pretty indicative of what the guidance range would indicate for the year. But there'll be different dynamics throughout the quarters to that. So for Q1 with the growth of 8%, that really was driven by a lot of the incremental DTC that we had for Simparica Trio in the quarter. And also, we didn't have savings from T&E in Q1. We had the savings from T& E in Q1, because in Q1 of 2020, that was pre-COVID. We still had our elevated T&E spend. As we move throughout the year, obviously we're not going to have that benefit. So the impact of the incremental DTC for Simparica Trio will be there, but we also increased our spending for DTC for Simparica Trio throughout the year last year. So a number of different factors, but the overall level of growth for the year perspective is pretty similar to what we saw for the quarter. Sure. So in terms of the overall top line step-up in the guidance, there are a number of factors that drove that beyond just companion animals. So obviously very pleased with the performance of Simparica Trio, and that is definitely one of the drivers for the guidance range. But as Kristin mentioned, also very strong performance in China, off to a very strong start to the year. Strong performance in Brazil as well, Brazilian market grew 48% for the quarter. So that's off to a very positive start. And then our diagnostics business as well. We had 47% growth in our diagnostics business in the quarter. So many of our key growth drivers for the long term performed very well in the quarter, which also then enabled us to raise the guidance for the year. So it's across a number of different of our key strategic growth drivers that enabled us to raise that guidance. In terms of poultry in the U.S., we did see some challenges this quarter as our producer customers did move to some cheaper alternatives from our products. That is something that we'll evaluate through the year. We do expect that there will be a movement back at some point to our products, but that's something that will evolve over time in terms of the efficacy that they see from those cheaper alternatives compared to our more premium products. And regarding diagnostics, a very strong quarter for our diagnostics portfolio. We grew 47% in the quarter overall. And that growth was really balanced from many different areas. So we saw the U.S. grew 59% in the quarter in diagnostics, with strong growth in our consumables really pulling through the increased instrument placements that we saw last year really drove increased consumables in the quarter. Also strong performance for our reference lab business and increased growth in our instrument revenue as well. So really strong performance in the U.S. And also for the U.S., it was an easier comparative period to Q1 of last year as well. International, very positive growth as well, growth of 24%, again really driven by strong growth in consumable usage in the international markets as well as increased instrument revenue as well. So very balanced strong growth in our diagnostics portfolio in the quarter. And we think that sets us up well for the year, and we do expect that our diagnostics business will outpace the growth of the overall diagnostics market in 2021. No, I'll move to the second question in terms of the OpEx spend and what we there are a number of different areas that are driving the incremental OpEx this year. Part of it is a normalization from the COVID impact in 2020. We would expect that T&E expenditures would begin to increase, particularly in the second half of the year. But also our compensation costs as we ramped up hiring some positions that may have been on hold, with the impact of COVID, were just more difficult to fill. We are increasing our hiring really to support the strength of many of our key brands and to continue the growth there. From a DTC spending perspective, we would expect more DTC spending this year driven by a couple of different factors. A, we have some Simparica Trio on the market for the full year. So we will support that with advertising expenditures for the full year as well. And we also continue to see strong growth in many of our brands, such as our dermatology portfolio, and will continue to increase and support those brands those brands of direct-to-consumer advertising, not only in the U.S. but outside of the U.S. as well where we are increasing our DTC spend behind many of our brands, including Simparica as well as our dermatology portfolio. So there are a number of areas will spend really to support the significant revenue growth opportunities that we see not only for this year but for many years beyond. Sure. So from a Librela gross margin perspective, I'll start with pricing for Librela, which is very important in terms of the overall profitability of the product. Now that we've launched in the EU, we have priced that product at a premium to the current therapies on the market, really consistent with some of the other products that have brought significant innovation in some of our other categories, such as dermatology. You would see Librela price at a premium similar to that. So we would expect that Librela will be a high-margin products consistent with the overall companion portfolio, which typically is above our overall gross margin level. So that will be a positive contributor to gross margin over time. In terms of ASF and our development for vaccines, as we've said before, this is a very complicated disease state. It's going to take many years to find a solution. We are active in those development studies, but it will be a multiyear time frame before we find a solution for African swine fever. Yes. So from an M&A perspective and our areas of focus for 2021, so build development remains a key area and part of our capital allocation strategy, and we remain focused on that. A couple of areas that we continue to pursue, consistent with what we've discussed in the past, is any specific geography where we may have an opportunity to gain additional share or presence in an area, that we may not be at the level of market share that we are globally. Those are areas that we will continue to focus on and look to bring in additional products into our portfolio. Also, many of the areas that we've stressed as areas of strategic importance to us, whether that's in areas such as precision livestock farming, genetics, diagnostics. Those are areas that we'll also continue to remain focused on as well as if there are only development assets as well that we believe would bring strength of our R&D portfolio, we can generate greater value than the existing company. So we remain focused on M&A. We evaluate many opportunities, and we will look to continue to use that as a prime area for capital allocation moving forward. Yes. With regards to inflation and the impact in -- we'll have on pricing across our portfolio, so we do expect over the long-term to continue to be able to take price increases ranging from 2% to 3% per year. This year will be a little muted in 2021 because of the impact of the DRAXXIN LOE. But beyond this year, we do expect to be able to return to that 2% to 3% average pricing. That will vary based on the product as well as the geography. Typically, in our more innovative products, we're able to take a little bit above that 2% to 3%. Products that have been on the market a little longer generally get a little below that 2% to 3%. And then in higher inflationary markets, we typically take pricing beyond that 2% to 3%. So we don't see any significant changes to that in the short to medium term, other than the fact that in 2021 because of the impact of the DRAXXIN LOE, we'll be below that 2% to 3%. No, I just echo what you said, Kristin. I'm very excited by the feedback that we saw with the early experience program. It does give us even greater confidence and more enthusiasm around the potential for these products in the EU and globally. And we're continuing to update our forecast based on the feedback that we get. Yes. No, just to say, obviously the longer out in the market alone, the better in terms of accelerating that peak sales curve. But to Kristin's point, this is a very large market, and we do see products on the market and franchises on the market that are approaching $1 billion today, even without a triple therapy in the U.S. So we think there is significant opportunity for future growth for this franchise. In terms of livestock, we are off to a strong start, and we do think that the reopening trends are positive for the overall animal health industry and the growth in livestock. We're also very pleased with the performance that we've seen in many of our key markets, particularly outside of the U.S. markets such as China and Brazil and what we've been able to accomplish there. And we expect those trends to continue to be very positive. Obviously, we do have some dynamics, particularly to our portfolio within livestock with the impact of DRAXXIN. But overall the fundamentals in the industry are remaining positive. Profitability is up for many of our producers, which is also very encouraging for the overall industry, and we think will be positive for the longer-term outlook for livestock."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report, Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company\u2019s 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 14, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full year results for 2022, in line with the high-end of our guidance from November and thanks to our diverse portfolio, global scale and talented colleagues. Our 8% operational revenue growth for the year was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally while our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally, primarily due to generic competition and market challenges, especially in the U.S. Thanks to our broad global scale and diversity, we delivered well-balanced operational growth across our U.S. and international segments, which grew 7% and 9% respectively. For the year, we generated operational growth in all of our top 13 markets despite the economic challenges, continued COVID recovery and political uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine. Reflecting our longstanding value proposition, we grew our adjusted net income faster than sales for the year with an operational increase of 11% for the full year and we use this performance and financial strength to continue investing in the R&D, manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing resources to support our future growth and pipeline. As we begin 2023, we will stay adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions around the world and focus on executing our plans. We remain very confident in the fundamental and resilient global demand for animal care. And most importantly, we are confident in Zoetis\u2019 ability to continue delivering solid sustainable growth as we resolve our prior supply constraints and build share of our market-leading franchises. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance even in the face of today\u2019s economic uncertainty. We are well positioned with our strategic priorities and capabilities to expand in large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics. We are guiding to a range of 6% to 8% operational growth for revenue in 2023 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 7% to 9% operationally, which reflects our increased investment plans for R&D and manufacturing to support growth. As the world leader in animal health, a market that has grown on average of 5% to 6% through various economic cycles over the last two decades, we feel very positive about how our portfolio, pipeline and strategy can drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders. Wetteny will discuss more details about the 4Q results and full year 2023 guidance, but let me provide some additional perspective on our business and set the stage for some of our growth drivers for the year. First, we have remained the world leader in animal health over the last decade, outperforming the market and bringing groundbreaking innovation to veterinarians, producers and pet owners who care for animals. We marked our 10-year anniversary as a public company on February 1, a decade, which saw us bring more than 2,000 new products and lifecycle innovations to market, build a diverse portfolio, featuring market-leading franchises and 15 current blockbusters generate consistent above-market revenue growth and deliver a total shareholder return of more than 500% all while increasing our market cap from $16 billion in 2013 to about $75 billion today. While we celebrate those accomplishments, I am even more excited about where we can go in the next decade and by the talented colleagues, innovative pipeline and best-in-class capabilities we have brought together at Zoetis. Our colleagues\u2019 purpose-driven mindset and steady performance in the face of adversity give me confidence in the continued execution, innovation, growth and durability of our business. As we turn to 2023, we are focused on five key growth catalysts for the year. In dermatology, we see excellent growth opportunities even after nearly a decade of game-changing innovation that began with the introduction of Apoquel in 2014 and has continued with the success of our first monoclonal antibody, Cytopoint, as well as recent lifecycle innovations like Apoquel chewable. We continue to see even more opportunities to grow and expand in this market. In pet parasiticides, the largest single product area in animal health, we continue to gain share and are now the second largest in revenue for this category. We have improved supply in 2023. We expect to continue expanding share in this market and supporting our diverse global portfolio beating Simparica Trio, our triple combination product. In the area of pain, we are off to a great start with our two monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela for dogs, which became our latest blockbuster in 2022 and Solensia for cats. We are once again revolutionizing care in this category and seeing very positive early reaction to both products in their large markets as we continue to expand geographies and supply. In terms of the U.S. approval for Librela, we remain confident in receiving approval in the first half of \u201823 with a leasing plan for late in the year. In diagnostics, we continue to generate solid above-market growth in international markets above our go-to-market model in the U.S. and drive greater global adoption for VETSCAN IMAGYST, our AI-based diagnostics platform. And finally, as population growth and economic mobility drive more demand for animal protein and pets, we see major opportunities in fast-growing emerging markets outside the U.S., where our portfolio is well suited to meet those evolving needs. Overall, our business continues to be weighted towards higher growth, innovation-driven areas in companion animal and these will remain our growth drivers for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio will remain a valuable cash-generating piece of our business as we continue to recover in the U.S. from generic competition and show solid growth in emerging markets. As always, we will stay disciplined yet adaptable, and our approach to the new market opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur. And in conclusion, Zoetis remains well positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth in 2023. Thank you. And I will hand this off to Wetteny.\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin and good morning everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2022 with revenue of $8.1 billion and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion both in line with the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 3% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Looking deeper into the operational growth for the year, price contributed 3% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 5%. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, including Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia, and 2% from key dermatology products, partially offset by a decline of 1% from other in-line products. Revenue growth was broad-based with positive operational growth in each of our top 13 markets, which make up approximately 85% of our total revenues with international growing 9% operationally and the U.S. growing 7%. Our growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative new products in our companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally. Our companion animal portfolio now makes up 64% of our global revenues. This growth was partially offset by our livestock business, which declined 2% operationally, primarily due to the generic competition, supply constraints as well as challenging market conditions in certain geographies. Performance in companion animal was driven by our small animal parasiticide portfolio, which grew 20% on an operational basis. Simparica Trio generated $744 million in sales, growing 58% on an operational basis. Our Simparica franchise reached $1 billion in global revenue for the first time in 2022. Our key dermatology products generated $1.3 billion in sales posting strong growth of 17% operationally with double-digit growth in both international and the U.S. Key derm growth in our international markets was especially strong at 27% operationally. We continue to see solid growth in our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain. As expected, sales of Librela eclipsed the $100 million mark on the year, marking Zoetis\u2019 15th blockbuster product. We look forward to Librela\u2019s expected launch in the U.S. in late 2023. Solensia contributed $30 million in sales in 2022, primarily from international markets, with solid penetration in the U.S. after a launch late in the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 2% operationally in the year, with declines in the U.S., partially offset by growth internationally. Our livestock business declined 2% on an operational basis. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generic and cheaper alternatives to DRAXXIN in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry. We do expect the generic impact to begin to moderate in 2023. Additional declines were driven by supply challenges on certain livestock products as well as unfavorable market conditions, especially the U.S. cattle and China swine markets. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $539 million is an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 27% operationally. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 6% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio as well as Librela and Solensia and 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products grew 1%. Companion animal products grew 15% operationally while our livestock portfolio was flat in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting global revenue of $171 million, representing operational growth of 39% for the quarter. We expect Simparica Trio to continue to grow the addressable market for fleet taking hardware globally and drive the conversion from collar and top parasiticides to oral combination products. These dynamics will provide additional run-rate for future expansion of the broader market and revenue growth for Trio even once competing triple combination products enter the market. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth in the quarter, posting $347 million of revenue, representing 14% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 23% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats continue to grow posting $39 million of revenue in the quarter, primarily in international markets. Meanwhile, sales of livestock products were flat on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in fish and poultry offset by the impact of generics and supply constraints on cattle and swine products. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal sales growing 12% and livestock sales declining by 6%. Focusing first on companion animal, we returned to double-digit growth in the quarter, as we resolved the majority of our supply issues from earlier in the year. In the U.S. veterinary practice revenue is growing approximately 6% and spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing 10% despite a 4% decline in clinic visits in the quarter. The visit decline reflects comparison to the peak visit numbers in 2021, driven by pandemic after-effects and increased adoption of pets as well as the impact of veterinary workforce challenges that have limited some clinic capacities. Absolute clinic visits remain above pre-pandemic levels. We continue to see growth in the retail segment outpacing other channels. In Q4, sales to our retail partners grew by 49%. Simparica Trio continues to drive growth in the quarter with sales of $158 million in the U.S., growing 39%. With the supply constraints from earlier in the year largely resolved, we were able to leverage promotional efforts to drive growth and regain market share in the quarter. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $239 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint, each growing double-digits. We expect to continue the expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. U.S. livestock declined 6% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by supply restocking for certain products in the third quarter of 2022 as well as the impact of generic competition in cattle and poultry. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 12% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 21% operationally and livestock grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticides portfolio, our key dermatology products and our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain. Our international small animal parasiticide portfolio had a very strong quarter. Growth was driven by revolution franchise, which rebounded well from supply challenges, especially in China. Our key dermatology products contributed $108 million to revenue and grew 22% on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in Cytopoint across all key markets and continued double-digit growth of Apoquel. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our oral pain portfolio with Librela generating $26 million and Solensia delivering $7 million in fourth quarter sales internationally. Librela sales in the quarter dipped slightly below the prior quarter due to the removal of supply allocation in certain markets, which led to higher inventory levels at the end of Q3. We expect to see significant contribution to growth in 2023 coming from Librela across our International segment. Moving on to our International Livestock segment, which grew 4% operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 25% operationally due to increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of poultry products grew due to increased demand for poultry protein. Growth was partially offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints in certain vaccines across international. The slight decline was partially offset by growth in China, driven by a weak comparative quarter in the prior year and improved swine market conditions. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 68.1% decreased 150 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin declined 60 basis points, driven by higher inventory charges as well as higher manufacturing and freight costs, which were partially offset by favorable price and mix. Operationally, adjusted operating expenses decreased 6% with SG&A declining 9% driven by lower compensation-related expenses and lower advertising and promotion, partially offset by higher freight and logistics related expenses. R&D expenses increased 10% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher project spend. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 220 basis points, primarily due to lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. Adjusted net income grew 27% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 30% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $171 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. For the year, we have repurchased almost $1.6 billion of Zoetis shares and returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2023, please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have a minimal impact versus the prior year, with the full year impact neutral at revenue and slightly accretive at adjusted net income. The foreign exchange impact in the first half will be unfavorable versus prior year, particularly in the first quarter. In the second half of the year, foreign exchange is expected to be favorable based on the late January exchange rates. For 2023, we are projecting revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. Volume will be 1% to 2% at the low end of our guidance range and 3% to 4% at the high end. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2023 with the continued strength of our diverse Simparica Trio portfolio, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and further expansion of our key dermatology products. Despite the decline in vet planning visits last year, industry fundamentals remain strong. Business remain above pre-COVID levels and clinic revenue is at an all-time high as the standard of care continues to increase. We anticipate modest livestock declines in 2023, driven by the generic impact on DRAXXIN sales, particularly in the first half as well as unfavorable market conditions in U.S. cattle. These declines will be partially offset by growth in poultry, driven by increased demand for poultry protein and new product launches as well as fish. The fundamental trends which make livestock an essential business remain intact. I\u2019d like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectation for revenue growth. For companion animal, we assume a triple combination product we will launch in the U.S. in the first half of 2023 to compete against Simparica Trio. We expect this entrant will help Trio drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination or parasiticides and still project significant growth for Trio. We do not expect competitive entrants in 2023 for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. We expect another year of robust growth of our key derm portfolio coming from continued expansion of the dermatology market and price. We are excited about the continued growth in our OA franchise and plan to launch in several new markets next year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%, where favorable foreign exchange price increases and product mix are partially offset by higher input costs. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.06 billion and $2.1 billion, with the increase from 2022 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2023, is expected to be between $635 million and $660 million. R&D spend can fluctuate year-over-year. This increased investment is reflective of both new projects as well as those advancing in our pipeline. Zoetis is the leader in animal health because of the disruptive innovation, novel products and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. This increase in R&D expenses reflects our commitment to ensuring our capital allocation prioritizes innovation. Adjusted interest and other income reductions are expected to be approximately $170 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion, representing operational growth of 7% to 9%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14. We are anticipating capital expenditures in 2023 to increase to $950 million to $1 billion. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage. Finally, Zoetis and the animal health industry remain resilient in the face of economic headwinds. Our 2023 guidance range is reflective of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and the impact of veterinary clinic labor challenges. While guidance represents our expectations for the full year, Q1 revenue is expected to be below the low end of the operational growth rate in our full year guidance due to a variety of reasons. First, Q1 2022 was a strong comparable quarter as we saw robust growth with limited impact from vet clinic labor constraints as well as minimal disruption from our diagnostics field force model change, which began in Q2. Additionally, in the quarter, we expect to see lingering impacts of the latest COVID wave in China. Lastly, the return of supply on certain products, including Simparica Trio, and subsequent channel restocking as well as promotions to regain share in Q4 2022 modestly increased inventory levels in the channel in the short-term. In Q1, we expect a modest decline in adjusted net income versus the prior year as a result of the timing of our 2022 sales force extension in the U.S., which did not start until Q2, as well as the R&D investment noted earlier, which is also off a low base in Q1 2022. Now to summarize. 2022 was another strong year despite some challenges, we significantly outperformed the market and continue to take share, all while growing the bottom line faster than the top line. As we begin 2023, we once again expect to grow faster than the market, driven by the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and expand existing markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in. Now I\u2019ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter, guys. I\u2019m going to throw in a couple of just real quick. First, I would have to get your latest thoughts on NexGard plus BI triple combo now that it\u2019s been unveiled at VMX. Just what are your expectations for Simparica Trio growth this year, if you could give us a ballpark for that? And then second, I want to talk about R&D spend in 2023. It seems to have jumped quite a lot year-over-year, and that\u2019s a big part of why operating margins aren\u2019t expanding as much as we\u2019re used to. Any specific programs you want to highlight? And anything you can say in terms of when that R&D spend will translate into future launches? Is this something that\u2019s sort of in the regulatory phase or weight clinical phase? Just give us a sense of where the extra $100 million year-over-year is going? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I\u2019ll take those and let\u2019s see if Wetteny has anything to add. The first, on Trio, obviously, we had a phenomenal year with 58% growth. We\u2019re really proud of that. Obviously, we got back in clinics after some of the supply problems, and we\u2019re fully back there. We\u2019ve got 90% penetration with an 80% reorder rate and are now the number two fleet tick heartworm there. We are expecting competition from NexGard Plus sometime in the first half. We actually assure you don\u2019t know exactly when that will be but we continue to expect the market to expand, and we continue to expect Simparica Trio to be growing on the year. I mean, albeit probably not at 58%, but we expect to have a very strong year. I think what you\u2019re going to see is really moving more customers from collars and topicals into what is a best-in-class fleet to heartworm combined oral products. So we expect to continue to go through this as we\u2019ve continued to say, we don\u2019t have any more information on the exact timing there. But we\u2019re going to be aggressive. As you\u2019ve seen us in Q4 and Q1, really investing behind this brand doing DTC, etcetera. So we expect strong growth there continuing even with a new entrant. And when you think about R&D spend, and I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll see Wetteny wants to build there. We\u2019ve gotten questions often from you and from a lot of our investors. Why don\u2019t you spend more in R&D or if you had a program would you invest in it? And I think what we\u2019re demonstrating is we see a very strong pipeline here. These incremental investments to your question are certainly the bigger ones are in late-stage development going into development that cost that, but also some great new technologies in the research side as well. So it\u2019s brought across the portfolio. It is a significant investment. And hopefully, it\u2019s assigned to all of you of our confidence in our pipeline and the strength of our R&D engine and our willingness to invest in that for the short and the long-term across their \u2013 we see obviously really big platforms there in parasiticides continuing to invest there, in dermatology and across our monoclonal antibody franchise, certainly, looking at long-acting as we\u2019ve talked about, but also new disease areas. So I don\u2019t know if I missed anything, Wetteny, do you want anything?\nWetteny Joseph: No. Look, I\u2019ll just add a couple of points. Going back to Trio, we expect, as Kristin said, for Trio to grow significantly in the year, although as we now are well into our third year with a product, we wouldn\u2019t expect it to continue to grow at 58%, which is what it did in 2022. Now the timing of our supply recovery in 2022 and the fact that as we see competition come in, it may drive some promotional activities that might drive some variability in terms of quarter-to-quarter in terms of where the growth is. But for the total year, we expect significant growth on Trio. And then on the R&D spend, it\u2019s our practice that we don\u2019t actually dictate what the investment in R&D is going to be. We let the pipeline dictated. And so as we see programs either coming into research or coming out of research into development or into late development as those programs require spending, and we do a full ROI spec, etcetera, on them, we go ahead and fund those. And so we\u2019re very pleased to see that the pipeline is demanding this level of investment and we will still be able to deliver faster growth at ANI in revenue based on our guide of 6% to 8% of revenue and 7% to 9% at adjusted net income.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel.\nJon Block: Great. Thanks, guys and good morning. Wetteny, the 4Q GM of 68.1% was a little bit below us for the quarter, but the 2023 guidance of 70% to 70.5% was certainly solid. So maybe if you can just talk to the drivers for \u201823 gross margin or those the supply chain easing, maybe a little bit about the cadence? And then maybe just sort of as a tack on to that or the second question. In 2022, it was sort of a tale of two halves for atopic derm. One H was operational around 20%, two H operational, I think it was closer to 10%. I think you guys alluded to solid growth in \u201823, but do you want to just frame that for us? Is it a continued deceleration of atopic derm into \u201823 with no competition because I think you clarified that? Or can we expect some level of stabilization, call it, in that high single, low double-digit range for the atopic derm franchise? Thanks, guys.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So I\u2019ll start and see if Kristin would add anything here. Let\u2019s start with gross margins. Look, if you look at the year, we were able to expand margins on the year. And certainly, as we explained in the prepared commentary, we saw FX come in to the tune of about 80 basis point headwind against gross margin in the fourth quarter. And certainly, we\u2019ve seen input costs or some manufacturing costs impact the gross margin picture that you saw in the fourth quarter. But given where OpEx came in, you saw substantial growth at ANI versus revenue where revenue came in at 9% in the quarter ANI coming and 27% growth in the quarter. I think as we go into 2023, given the timing of our price increases, which started at the beginning of the year, as you know, certainly, we\u2019ve seen some inflation in input costs coming out of \u201822, but we go into \u201823 price increases that start to change that as we go into \u201823, which is why we give guidance where we see about 40 basis point margin \u2013 gross margin expansion on the year. And obviously, a point, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance on growth higher at ANI versus the top line is what I would say on the margin point. And certainly, as you look at continued growth of companion animal outpacing the growth of livestock in the business, that mix will be favorable to us in addition to what I already covered from a price perspective. I think if you look at the atopic derm, we delivered $1.3 billion of revenue in 2022, that\u2019s a 17% increase. And we\u2019re almost at 10 years since Apoquel was launched and it\u2019s just amazing to see that we continue to expand the market, and we believe there is more room to expand not only in the U.S., where we grew 12% in 2022, but particularly in international markets, it takes longer to get to peak sales levels, and we delivered 27% growth in international. I think we will continue to see really solid growth across the business. We have had double-digit growth in 2023. Though it may not be at the level that you\u2019ve seen in 2021, where we grew to think about 23% and then 17% in 2022, but we continue to see room to continue to expand the derm market here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. So two questions here. One, how much did the lingering supply chain issues impact on Simparica Trio sales in the quarter, if at all? And how much did the stocking benefit offset that in the fourth quarter? And did you benefit across other product lines in terms of distributor stocking that we should be aware of in terms of that first quarter cadence as well. And just if you could talk a little bit more and maybe you touched on this with the gross margin dynamic. But in terms of overall price, you are taking across the two core species segments here. And then my second question is on Librela. Can you give us an update on the U.S. Librela approval? And what does guidance assume in terms of U.S. contribution from Librela is that material in 2023? Thanks.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So let me first touch on your questions around supply, and it\u2019s Trio as well as other products. As we said in the third quarter call, while we had some outages in supply during the year, particularly in the third quarter, competitors actually took advantage of that and run promotions. And we certainly intended to run promotions as we recovered on supply, which we did in the fourth quarter. And so I think the timing of our supply recovery, whether it\u2019s for Trio in the U.S. or for Revolution in China will drive some stocking levels, certainly as we enter into 2023, which we discussed. But I think typically, you\u2019ll see some increase in inventory levels from Q3 to Q4 anyway, because distributors are anticipating our price increases and the intent to drive a little bit of that. So I would say when I look at across other products, it\u2019s probably more in the range of typical increase that you would see. But if you look at Trio, we\u2019re probably, if I had to bracket it in terms of the impact on Trio, if you back out, what would typically be an increase from Q3 to Q4 anyway. So the incremental contribution in the fourth quarter, I\u2019d put somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range. So it\u2019s not a significant number for us. And certainly, as we discussed already, we factored that into our guidance, and we expect significant growth from Trio on the year. With respect to Librela, look, we continue to expect and I\u2019m very confident that we will see an approval in a well in the first half of the year, our plans have not changed. We continue to plan to have an early experience program run on the program once we\u2019ve gotten approval and we have the label set, etcetera, and that will transition into a launch sometime late in the year.\nKristin Peck: And our practice \u2013 just to build on that, our practice on that is that we do not include in our guidance or our budget if we\u2019re expecting a late launch in the year. We\u2019ve always done that as those have cover us for a while. So Librela is not in our current guidance that we provided. We will update the guidance once we have a better sense. And obviously, this is a big product and when it launches, it could have a big impact. So whether or not you have 1 month, 3 months, etcetera, 4 months, it makes a big difference. So we will update guidance once we have a better sense of that approval. So to clarify your second question, Librela is not in the guidance that we provided. We fully do expect to have it, but we will update our guidance once we have a better sense of what the exact timing is.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. And we will give a better bracket in terms of what we expect the impact depending on the timing of the launch and what we see through the EEP program, etcetera.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, here. So I wanted to see if you could give more color on how you\u2019re investing in supply to meet the growing demand for your products and when you actually expect to complete \u2013 or what your objectives here? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, I\u2019ll take that. And see Kristin would add on anything. We are investing in a number of areas when it comes to our supply network, upload a couple of categories, I\u2019d say, in the short \u2013 near-term, we have investments clearly in inventory to help absorb any shocks that come through the supply chain. We\u2019re making investments in our demand planning processes and tools to give us better visibility etcetera as well as we don\u2019t see that we are building in, in certain aspects of our inputs now coming into our manufacturing process. Longer term, as you may have listened on the prepared commentary, we\u2019re making significant capital investments across our network across the network in the U.S. to support our monoclonal antibodies, both for products that have already been approved and are launching. And what we have in our pipeline is well from a math perspective. It is a platform that we continue to innovate on. And then all solid dose as well, whether it\u2019s parasiticides, derm session in various aspects. We are making investments throughout the network for those we\u2019re making investments to support our vector vaccine manufacturing, for example, as well for livestock and so on. So we are making investments across the organization, investments in tech and digital to leverage data again, to give us better visibility as well for the long-term to support our long-term growth aspirations.\nKristin Peck: The only thing I would build on there, Louise, is I mean if you look at the CapEx number that Wetteny was talking about in his prepared remarks, of $950 million to $1 billion. That is clearly the highest CapEx that we have had. But I also think you should look also at what we said were about R&D. And if you look at significant new investments in R&D, those are going to be products that we are going to have to be able to manufacture in a few years. What you are seeing is the commensurate investment in our manufacturing capabilities to be able to launch those products and really critical platforms across the globe. So, we are very confident in where our pipeline is, and we are going to invest in our manufacturing capacity to deliver on those products over the medium to long-term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The first one on Trio, I would be curious just to get a sense of what kind of factors you are watching as you think about the impact that competition could have. And magnitudes that would kind of push you to the higher or lower end of your range for competition. And are you anticipating any changes to pricing or your promotional cadence when competition enters? And then my second question on DRAXXIN. Just how much of a drag will that continue to be in 2023? I think you have previously said that you will start to cycle the second year of competitive entry in the first quarter, but I think there has been some more recent price changes. So, just curious what we should expect in terms of the impact on the livestock business this year?\nKristin Peck: Sure, Nate. I will take the first question and then I will let Wetteny take your second question on DRAXXIN. Look, we have been expecting competition for a long time on Trio, I would say. So, I would say we are well prepared for what that is. We have been investing heavily, obviously, behind DTC, really investing with our customers and with pet owners directly to make sure that when competition enters, that we have very pleased customers. And a few things I will point to there, obviously, it\u2019s our direct-to-consumer advertising, I would say, our broad portfolio and our \u2013 as you look at our relationship with corporate accounts, we are very strong with corporate accounts. We are their preferred product. So, I think that will provide some resiliency. But I would also say auto ship remains a real strength. This is not a sector where people often switch unless there is a really good reason. So, new dogs they will make a choice. But they are not \u2013 I think customers are already on our product are not going to be that inspired to change. And if you look at the dynamics certainly in the U.S. around retail, it grew 43% on the year. It\u2019s now about 11% of our U.S. business. And I highlight that because the more that insulates us from potential new entrants coming. And we obviously expect NexGard Plus, but I am sure there will be others over the next 1 year to 2 years that enter as well. So, we are really investing in insulating ourselves from that impact by investing in pet owner loyalty programs, DTC, a broad portfolio with innovation with our customers wanting to do corporate account side also underscore. And then lastly, auto ship and strong relationships with the retail sector. So, do you want to take the second question on DRAXXIN?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, absolutely. Look, as we said from the very beginning, we were expecting DRAXXIN to have about 20% decline in the first year of generic competition and then another 20% in the second year. The first year was slightly better than our expectations coming in somewhere around 16% decline. But the second year was a little bit worse. So, I think we are sort of in that ballpark. I think the second year is about 25%. So, we are at a level now that once we lap, I would say, the second year, which would be through the first quarter of \u201823, which is why in the previous commentary, we said, particularly in the first quarter, I think we are at a low enough level, won\u2019t be as meaningful as an impact on us, and I think the drag on our overall are stock business won\u2019t be as significant. So, I would still expect some pressure on livestock given where U.S. cattle, for example, as a market is we are watching swine, particularly in China and anti [ph] has across other regions to determine where we end up lending. But we think livestock will be slightly down year-on-year, maybe marginally better than we \u2013 than you saw in 2023, where livestock was down 2%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Westenberg from Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Thank you for taking the question. So, I want to kind of continue with the some on Trio dynamics. Can you talk about maybe if you got any word on in terms of what the label might look like on the competitive launch? And can you give a little bit more color? I think you said in the prepared remarks that you expect it to come from collars and topical. What are you kind of seeing in the marketplace that suggests that as opposed to whether maybe legacy oral parasiticides? And then kind of the second question here is on the increase in R&D spending, are you going to continue to give out some of the \u2013 what you have in pipeline about \u2013 I think you guys usually give out six months in advance to Wall Street. Is that kind of still the expectation when you talk about pipeline? And thank you very much.\nKristin Peck: Hi Dave. I will start on Trio and then maybe Wetteny can clarify if there is anything I am missing, and then let me take the R&D question as well. Look, we don\u2019t have any clear signs of what the label of competition will be. We are very confident in our current label. We don\u2019t think it has any holes. I have got to tell you, we are at 100% heartworm protection. So, I am not really sure where you are going to hit us on that. We have also been out on the market now since 2020 with this, which means we have a very strong set of safety data as well. So, I am sure, as always, they will \u2013 competition will enter and they will try to find any angle they can. But we don\u2019t really think there is any holes in our label right now that we are concerned about. We are in puppies, if you look back to Simparica. And the second part of your question, look, yes, they will move from single agents. I think they will, single agents from just flea, tick or just heartworm products, I think we will move into the combination label for sure. But we are not expecting pricing to be a big factor initially. And really, that has to do with who is entering, because if they don\u2019t enter the market similarly priced or higher than their current two products, they are going to cannibalize themselves. So, I think really, the power of who is entering does not lead us to believe that price is going to be a major factor and who enters. I mean obviously, we will adapt to whatever comes, whatever label they have, but we remain very confident in our label, in our relationships and in our data today. But \u2013 do you want to take the second question, or do you want me?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, it\u2019s only small addition I will do to Trio is we do get to 100% heartworm after the first dose. So \u2013 and with the product being in the market almost 3 years and satisfaction levels being very high and penetration across clinics, etcetera, we are very confident on our position as competition enters into the space. On R&D, look, I think unlike human health in animal health is not as much visibility as given with respect to what\u2019s being specifically worked in the pipeline, we see that as a competitive advantage for us given our track record and how we continue to drive innovation in the spaces that we enter. And so we won\u2019t necessarily be changing that significantly here in terms of what we have in here, but we have talked about various aspects of unmet needs that if you were to ask veterinary practitioners, what are the top 5 or 10 unmet needs that they have, I think you would imagine that we are working on all of those areas.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. I just had a question on the overall volume comments you made. I think it was 1% to 2% volume growth at the low end versus 3% to 4% at the high end. Can you just elaborate on the dynamics there? So, how does that look at for companion versus livestock? And maybe as part of that, what\u2019s implied in terms of vet visit growth this year? And is that even a relevant swing factor in any of the overall outlook for the business? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So, look, I think if you look at our 2022 results, the net price contribution is about 3%. Now if you take vaccine out, that number is about 4% and companion animal would be at the higher number here, with certain products essentially above that. Now, we are very pleased to be able to take price, which typically is about 2% to 3%. And here in 2022, it was about double what we would normally do, and we still saw about 5% volume growth in 2022. So, as we look at 2023, I think you would see price with DRAXXIN impact being less than it was in \u201823 in particular, plus how we are going into price in certain products, I think you are going to expect a higher price contribution on the year, the timing of that in terms of where customers may have bought ahead of the price increases and so on. So, you might see a little bit of a lag in terms of when you see the price picture play out, but you would see at the low end of our range, but it\u2019s a bigger contributor. But at the upper end, it\u2019s all additional volume. In terms of where we see clinic traffic, certainly, we have seen vet visits come down versus the peak that we saw in 2021. In the fourth quarter, visits were down about 4%, but revenue per visit was up 10% and total revenue was up 6% on the quarter. Again, continuing the trends that we see as being sustainable which is pet owners willing to pay for innovation and seeing sustainably higher revenue for pet clinics. Now, we are still very early in 2023. But as we look at data, in January, we are seeing some increases in vet visits. Again, as we expected, we have been running above pre-pandemic levels. So, even in Q4, where visits were down 12%, they were actually still 2% above Q4 2019. And so we have been saying that, that\u2019s the element to continue to watch. I think one month is a little bit early to call it, but we are expecting visits business to be flat to up in 2023, and we are starting to see some signals of that earlier in the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez from William Blair.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question. My first is just on the diagnostics side, you guys have, I believe talked about this before, but maybe can you refresh us on where you are on some of the commercial changes, I think it was in the U.S., where those are and what that might mean for growth and potentially accelerating that business into \u201823-plus? And the other is just on China. You guys had a nice rebound there. I think you mentioned a little bit of supply coming back on the market, but maybe tempered that a little bit with COVID headwinds. So, curious how those two shake out maybe 1.5 months into this first quarter? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure, Brandon. I will start and let Wetteny build on both of them. So, in diagnostics, first of all, just ready and are joining you from our national sales meeting actually out in Denver. And I would say the energy in our diagnostics team is just amazing. So, we will \u2013 as Wetteny mentioned in his prepared remarks, Q1, a little, but we didn\u2019t have them on board until Q2 of 2022. So, what we are expecting as we look into 2022 as we get into the sort of middle of the year and the end of the year is really a return to at least market growth in the U.S., if not faster. We have continued to see very strong growth in international, as you saw from last year, and we expect that to continue into the year. So, we are really excited about the new field force, having them on the ground, having them fully up to speed. Wetteny and I spent a lot of time with them yesterday. So, I would say super optimistic overall in diagnostics, returning to growth across the board, certainly, the images platform and investments there. And then I will start on China and let\u2019s see what Wetteny has to build on it. We did see overall strong growth in the year of 11% and we are optimistic so far year-to-date in sort of the return in China. We have seen both on the companion and animal side, a really strong rebound there as we look into \u2013 certainly, for us, our year is both December and January. December, obviously, with the number of people home stick there was a little weaker, but we are seeing really strong rebound in January. And we are looking, I think at a strong year for us in China. Also, as you look at livestock with opening up China, more return to eating out to travel, to tourism will not just be good for China, to be honest with you, it could be good for livestock across the globe. So, it\u2019s one to watch, obviously, there is huge uncertainty around China not to mention geopolitical tensions and potential UFO these days. But we stayed really confident in where we think China will be for the year. But it remains a big risk both for China as well as for livestock across the board because I think a lot of if China returns, they will see China buying a lot of poultry, beef, etcetera, from Brazil, Europe, the U.S. there. But I don\u2019t know if you want to build anything either on the diagnostics question or China, Wetteny?\nWetteny Joseph: Look, it\u2019s great to be here in Denver with a large number of our colleagues on Valentine\u2019s Day. But look, I think China, we have been very pleased to see how China ended the year high-double digit growth on the quarter. My comments around supply was just the timing of recovery, particularly on revolution, Revolution Plus in that market that might create some dynamics on quarter-to-quarter. But we are expecting really solid growth out of China this year. I think the first quarter though, given the timing of the COVID waves. Just as a reminder, our international segment closes in \u2013 at the end of November, which means the quarter really started in December for them. And so a lot of that occurred in the first quarter, and we are seeing that having an impact, but we do see a rebound and as Kristin said, it has implications for other markets in terms of exports into China, but we are expecting a really solid rebound there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James.\nElliot Wilbur: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to go back to some of your early commentary around growth expectations for the key derm franchise? And just specifically thinking about the key levers in 2023, Kristin, I wonder if you can maybe just talk about, especially given the high level of penetration of Apoquel in the U.S. What the key levers there are going for or whether it would be price, new market entry, geographic expansion or just outperformance by Cytopoint relative to Apoquel? And then for Wetteny, just \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you said this in your prepared commentary or not, I didn\u2019t catch it if you did. But within gross margin guidance, could you just talk maybe about the inflationary headwinds that are sort of embedded in your guidance for this year? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I would say a few things on derm, both domestically as well as globally. We will be looking to expand and I think as Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, reaching peak sales in some of these markets takes a little bit longer outside of the U.S. So, we are continuing to see very strong growth in dermatology, both in Apoquel and Cytopoint as well as life cycle innovation remains really important for us here. The movement to Apoquel Chewable \u2013 it\u2019s been growing much faster than we expected and the conversion there remains very, very strong. So, I think it\u2019s both, you are going to see growth in volume, certainly potentially a little more globally. But beyond Apoquel, I mean I think Cytopoint, that\u2019s really love it and so do customers. It\u2019s 100% compliance. So, I think if you look at the overall franchise, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Apoquel Chewable, we will probably see greater growth outside the U.S. So, we are both looking at volume. We have taken price consistently here. And certainly, 2023 will be no different here. So, I think you will see growth from both price and from volume, you will see chewable really building on it. I think you will see a real uptick in Cytopoint. Again, we are back to absolute full supply. We, as you know, last year, did need to make some trade-off decisions there, because that the same impacts as our other mAbs and in some of our vaccines with regard to some of the COVID vaccine supply challenges we had. But we are back full speed. So, we are also really investing in other big growth drivers here will be direct-to-consumer advertising in international. So, we are going to do unbranded DTC as we have started last year. And we are really \u2013 even in the U.S., you still have 6 million itchy dogs that are currently undiagnosed and not treated. So, we really continue to see growth here, as we said, double digit, as Wetteny mentioned earlier, but I will let Wetteny take the second question, obviously, on inflation in 2023 and etcetera.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So, look, I think across the macro elements, we have been appropriately prudent in how we have laid out this guidance in the range that we have given today. But specifically on gross margins, if you look at inflation, as we are preparing to come into the year, we are certainly accounting for significant inflationary pressure on some of our input costs, energy, Europe, etcetera. But as we have entered the year, I think they are a little bit better than what we anticipated coming into the year, but still significant inflation that\u2019s baked into what we have here, which obviously are more than offset by our mix and our price, which is why you see some modest gross margin improvement year-on-year as we go through the year. But we have factored in a fairly significant inflationary pressure in the gross margin figures that we gave.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Balaji Prasad from Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Akhila on for Balaji. Thanks for taking our questions. Just two for me. I guess could you first just provide some additional color on business development priorities for the year? And then building upon an earlier question, what are your volume expectations from new pet additions for the year? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So, look, when you look at our capital allocation priorities, certainly investing in the business is the first place we go. And clearly, we are poised to significantly invest in the areas of R&D as well as across our supply chain and manufacturing \u2013 you saw the significant increase in R&D spend anticipated for 2023 versus 2022. And our CapEx numbers are going to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion on the year. Certainly, as you look at our strategic priorities, they are aligned with where we look at from a BD perspective in terms of where there might be opportunities to accelerate some of those execution on our strategies. And they span across our current slate of businesses, including some of the R&D areas in terms of external innovation and so on. BD is one of those areas, as you know, is hard to predict in terms of exact timing and so on, but it is an important lever that I would say, second after investing in the business. And then thirdly, as you saw in 2022, we are returning capital to shareholders to the tune of $2.2 billion in total between share buybacks and dividends. Alright. I think you had a question \u2013 sorry, I think you had a question in terms of new pets. Look, if you look at the growth in the industry over the last two decades, it\u2019s been about 5% to 6%. The way I look at it, vet visits, in essence, as you see pet population growth and so on, it would be reflected in that. They have accounted for about 1% of that growth historically. So, the bigger element of growth here is really pet owners\u2019 willingness to spend for innovation, and you see that reflected in the spend per visit figures that are far more in terms of the impact on growth historically, and we anticipate that continuing. So, as you sit here today, I wouldn\u2019t say new pet increases is a major factor into what we are looking at. It\u2019s our innovation and pet owners willing to pay. And the demographics of pet ownership with Gen Z and millennials willing to spend more on pet health and prioritizing those as well as higher income households that are bringing pets and more pets into their homes. Those are the factors that we watch that contribute to growth.\nOperator: It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to CEO, Kristin Peck.\nKristin Peck: Thank you so much, and thanks everybody for your questions and certainly for your continued interest in Zoetis. And just to summarize, we see really positive and sustainable demand for our products based on the fundamental drivers of animal health, we see continued strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our products for pet care. And we are continuing to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the manufacturing capabilities that can support our future growth, while adapting our business to the increasingly dynamic environment where we operate. So, we look forward to keeping you updated on future calls, and thanks so much for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full year results for 2022, in line with the high-end of our guidance from November and thanks to our diverse portfolio, global scale and talented colleagues. Our 8% operational revenue growth for the year was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally while our livestock portfolio declined 2% operationally, primarily due to generic competition and market challenges, especially in the U.S. Thanks to our broad global scale and diversity, we delivered well-balanced operational growth across our U.S. and international segments, which grew 7% and 9% respectively. For the year, we generated operational growth in all of our top 13 markets despite the economic challenges, continued COVID recovery and political uncertainty created by the war in Ukraine. Reflecting our longstanding value proposition, we grew our adjusted net income faster than sales for the year with an operational increase of 11% for the full year and we use this performance and financial strength to continue investing in the R&D, manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing resources to support our future growth and pipeline. As we begin 2023, we will stay adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions around the world and focus on executing our plans. We remain very confident in the fundamental and resilient global demand for animal care. And most importantly, we are confident in Zoetis' ability to continue delivering solid sustainable growth as we resolve our prior supply constraints and build share of our market-leading franchises. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance even in the face of today's economic uncertainty. We are well positioned with our strategic priorities and capabilities to expand in large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics. We are guiding to a range of 6% to 8% operational growth for revenue in 2023 and adjusted net income growth in the range of 7% to 9% operationally, which reflects our increased investment plans for R&D and manufacturing to support growth. As the world leader in animal health, a market that has grown on average of 5% to 6% through various economic cycles over the last two decades, we feel very positive about how our portfolio, pipeline and strategy can drive long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers and shareholders. Wetteny will discuss more details about the 4Q results and full year 2023 guidance, but let me provide some additional perspective on our business and set the stage for some of our growth drivers for the year. First, we have remained the world leader in animal health over the last decade, outperforming the market and bringing groundbreaking innovation to veterinarians, producers and pet owners who care for animals. We marked our 10-year anniversary as a public company on February 1, a decade, which saw us bring more than 2,000 new products and lifecycle innovations to market, build a diverse portfolio, featuring market-leading franchises and 15 current blockbusters generate consistent above-market revenue growth and deliver a total shareholder return of more than 500% all while increasing our market cap from $16 billion in 2013 to about $75 billion today. While we celebrate those accomplishments, I am even more excited about where we can go in the next decade and by the talented colleagues, innovative pipeline and best-in-class capabilities we have brought together at Zoetis. Our colleagues' purpose-driven mindset and steady performance in the face of adversity give me confidence in the continued execution, innovation, growth and durability of our business. As we turn to 2023, we are focused on five key growth catalysts for the year. In dermatology, we see excellent growth opportunities even after nearly a decade of game-changing innovation that began with the introduction of Apoquel in 2014 and has continued with the success of our first monoclonal antibody, Cytopoint, as well as recent lifecycle innovations like Apoquel chewable. We continue to see even more opportunities to grow and expand in this market. In pet parasiticides, the largest single product area in animal health, we continue to gain share and are now the second largest in revenue for this category. We have improved supply in 2023. We expect to continue expanding share in this market and supporting our diverse global portfolio beating Simparica Trio, our triple combination product. In the area of pain, we are off to a great start with our two monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela for dogs, which became our latest blockbuster in 2022 and Solensia for cats. We are once again revolutionizing care in this category and seeing very positive early reaction to both products in their large markets as we continue to expand geographies and supply. In terms of the U.S. approval for Librela, we remain confident in receiving approval in the first half of \u201823 with a leasing plan for late in the year. In diagnostics, we continue to generate solid above-market growth in international markets above our go-to-market model in the U.S. and drive greater global adoption for VETSCAN IMAGYST, our AI-based diagnostics platform. And finally, as population growth and economic mobility drive more demand for animal protein and pets, we see major opportunities in fast-growing emerging markets outside the U.S., where our portfolio is well suited to meet those evolving needs. Overall, our business continues to be weighted towards higher growth, innovation-driven areas in companion animal and these will remain our growth drivers for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio will remain a valuable cash-generating piece of our business as we continue to recover in the U.S. from generic competition and show solid growth in emerging markets. As always, we will stay disciplined yet adaptable, and our approach to the new market opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur. And in conclusion, Zoetis remains well positioned in terms of our market leadership, financial strength, investment strategies and diverse portfolio to deliver sustainable growth in 2023. Thank you. And I will hand this off to Wetteny. Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll take those and let's see if Wetteny has anything to add. The first, on Trio, obviously, we had a phenomenal year with 58% growth. We're really proud of that. Obviously, we got back in clinics after some of the supply problems, and we're fully back there. We've got 90% penetration with an 80% reorder rate and are now the number two fleet tick heartworm there. We are expecting competition from NexGard Plus sometime in the first half. We actually assure you don't know exactly when that will be but we continue to expect the market to expand, and we continue to expect Simparica Trio to be growing on the year. I mean, albeit probably not at 58%, but we expect to have a very strong year. I think what you're going to see is really moving more customers from collars and topicals into what is a best-in-class fleet to heartworm combined oral products. So we expect to continue to go through this as we've continued to say, we don't have any more information on the exact timing there. But we're going to be aggressive. As you've seen us in Q4 and Q1, really investing behind this brand doing DTC, etcetera. So we expect strong growth there continuing even with a new entrant. And when you think about R&D spend, and I'll start and I'll see Wetteny wants to build there. We've gotten questions often from you and from a lot of our investors. Why don't you spend more in R&D or if you had a program would you invest in it? And I think what we're demonstrating is we see a very strong pipeline here. These incremental investments to your question are certainly the bigger ones are in late-stage development going into development that cost that, but also some great new technologies in the research side as well. So it's brought across the portfolio. It is a significant investment. And hopefully, it's assigned to all of you of our confidence in our pipeline and the strength of our R&D engine and our willingness to invest in that for the short and the long-term across their \u2013 we see obviously really big platforms there in parasiticides continuing to invest there, in dermatology and across our monoclonal antibody franchise, certainly, looking at long-acting as we've talked about, but also new disease areas. So I don't know if I missed anything, Wetteny, do you want anything? And our practice \u2013 just to build on that, our practice on that is that we do not include in our guidance or our budget if we're expecting a late launch in the year. We've always done that as those have cover us for a while. So Librela is not in our current guidance that we provided. We will update the guidance once we have a better sense. And obviously, this is a big product and when it launches, it could have a big impact. So whether or not you have 1 month, 3 months, etcetera, 4 months, it makes a big difference. So we will update guidance once we have a better sense of that approval. So to clarify your second question, Librela is not in the guidance that we provided. We fully do expect to have it, but we will update our guidance once we have a better sense of what the exact timing is. The only thing I would build on there, Louise, is I mean if you look at the CapEx number that Wetteny was talking about in his prepared remarks, of $950 million to $1 billion. That is clearly the highest CapEx that we have had. But I also think you should look also at what we said were about R&D. And if you look at significant new investments in R&D, those are going to be products that we are going to have to be able to manufacture in a few years. What you are seeing is the commensurate investment in our manufacturing capabilities to be able to launch those products and really critical platforms across the globe. So, we are very confident in where our pipeline is, and we are going to invest in our manufacturing capacity to deliver on those products over the medium to long-term. Sure, Nate. I will take the first question and then I will let Wetteny take your second question on DRAXXIN. Look, we have been expecting competition for a long time on Trio, I would say. So, I would say we are well prepared for what that is. We have been investing heavily, obviously, behind DTC, really investing with our customers and with pet owners directly to make sure that when competition enters, that we have very pleased customers. And a few things I will point to there, obviously, it's our direct-to-consumer advertising, I would say, our broad portfolio and our \u2013 as you look at our relationship with corporate accounts, we are very strong with corporate accounts. We are their preferred product. So, I think that will provide some resiliency. But I would also say auto ship remains a real strength. This is not a sector where people often switch unless there is a really good reason. So, new dogs they will make a choice. But they are not \u2013 I think customers are already on our product are not going to be that inspired to change. And if you look at the dynamics certainly in the U.S. around retail, it grew 43% on the year. It's now about 11% of our U.S. business. And I highlight that because the more that insulates us from potential new entrants coming. And we obviously expect NexGard Plus, but I am sure there will be others over the next 1 year to 2 years that enter as well. So, we are really investing in insulating ourselves from that impact by investing in pet owner loyalty programs, DTC, a broad portfolio with innovation with our customers wanting to do corporate account side also underscore. And then lastly, auto ship and strong relationships with the retail sector. So, do you want to take the second question on DRAXXIN? Hi Dave. I will start on Trio and then maybe Wetteny can clarify if there is anything I am missing, and then let me take the R&D question as well. Look, we don't have any clear signs of what the label of competition will be. We are very confident in our current label. We don't think it has any holes. I have got to tell you, we are at 100% heartworm protection. So, I am not really sure where you are going to hit us on that. We have also been out on the market now since 2020 with this, which means we have a very strong set of safety data as well. So, I am sure, as always, they will \u2013 competition will enter and they will try to find any angle they can. But we don't really think there is any holes in our label right now that we are concerned about. We are in puppies, if you look back to Simparica. And the second part of your question, look, yes, they will move from single agents. I think they will, single agents from just flea, tick or just heartworm products, I think we will move into the combination label for sure. But we are not expecting pricing to be a big factor initially. And really, that has to do with who is entering, because if they don't enter the market similarly priced or higher than their current two products, they are going to cannibalize themselves. So, I think really, the power of who is entering does not lead us to believe that price is going to be a major factor and who enters. I mean obviously, we will adapt to whatever comes, whatever label they have, but we remain very confident in our label, in our relationships and in our data today. But \u2013 do you want to take the second question, or do you want me? Sure, Brandon. I will start and let Wetteny build on both of them. So, in diagnostics, first of all, just ready and are joining you from our national sales meeting actually out in Denver. And I would say the energy in our diagnostics team is just amazing. So, we will \u2013 as Wetteny mentioned in his prepared remarks, Q1, a little, but we didn't have them on board until Q2 of 2022. So, what we are expecting as we look into 2022 as we get into the sort of middle of the year and the end of the year is really a return to at least market growth in the U.S., if not faster. We have continued to see very strong growth in international, as you saw from last year, and we expect that to continue into the year. So, we are really excited about the new field force, having them on the ground, having them fully up to speed. Wetteny and I spent a lot of time with them yesterday. So, I would say super optimistic overall in diagnostics, returning to growth across the board, certainly, the images platform and investments there. And then I will start on China and let's see what Wetteny has to build on it. We did see overall strong growth in the year of 11% and we are optimistic so far year-to-date in sort of the return in China. We have seen both on the companion and animal side, a really strong rebound there as we look into \u2013 certainly, for us, our year is both December and January. December, obviously, with the number of people home stick there was a little weaker, but we are seeing really strong rebound in January. And we are looking, I think at a strong year for us in China. Also, as you look at livestock with opening up China, more return to eating out to travel, to tourism will not just be good for China, to be honest with you, it could be good for livestock across the globe. So, it's one to watch, obviously, there is huge uncertainty around China not to mention geopolitical tensions and potential UFO these days. But we stayed really confident in where we think China will be for the year. But it remains a big risk both for China as well as for livestock across the board because I think a lot of if China returns, they will see China buying a lot of poultry, beef, etcetera, from Brazil, Europe, the U.S. there. But I don't know if you want to build anything either on the diagnostics question or China, Wetteny? Sure. I would say a few things on derm, both domestically as well as globally. We will be looking to expand and I think as Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, reaching peak sales in some of these markets takes a little bit longer outside of the U.S. So, we are continuing to see very strong growth in dermatology, both in Apoquel and Cytopoint as well as life cycle innovation remains really important for us here. The movement to Apoquel Chewable \u2013 it's been growing much faster than we expected and the conversion there remains very, very strong. So, I think it's both, you are going to see growth in volume, certainly potentially a little more globally. But beyond Apoquel, I mean I think Cytopoint, that's really love it and so do customers. It's 100% compliance. So, I think if you look at the overall franchise, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Apoquel Chewable, we will probably see greater growth outside the U.S. So, we are both looking at volume. We have taken price consistently here. And certainly, 2023 will be no different here. So, I think you will see growth from both price and from volume, you will see chewable really building on it. I think you will see a real uptick in Cytopoint. Again, we are back to absolute full supply. We, as you know, last year, did need to make some trade-off decisions there, because that the same impacts as our other mAbs and in some of our vaccines with regard to some of the COVID vaccine supply challenges we had. But we are back full speed. So, we are also really investing in other big growth drivers here will be direct-to-consumer advertising in international. So, we are going to do unbranded DTC as we have started last year. And we are really \u2013 even in the U.S., you still have 6 million itchy dogs that are currently undiagnosed and not treated. So, we really continue to see growth here, as we said, double digit, as Wetteny mentioned earlier, but I will let Wetteny take the second question, obviously, on inflation in 2023 and etcetera. Thank you so much, and thanks everybody for your questions and certainly for your continued interest in Zoetis. And just to summarize, we see really positive and sustainable demand for our products based on the fundamental drivers of animal health, we see continued strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our products for pet care. And we are continuing to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the manufacturing capabilities that can support our future growth, while adapting our business to the increasingly dynamic environment where we operate.

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin and good morning everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2022 with revenue of $8.1 billion and adjusted net income of $2.3 billion both in line with the high end of our November full year guidance range. Full year revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% operationally with adjusted net income increasing 3% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Looking deeper into the operational growth for the year, price contributed 3% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 5%. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, including Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia, and 2% from key dermatology products, partially offset by a decline of 1% from other in-line products. Revenue growth was broad-based with positive operational growth in each of our top 13 markets, which make up approximately 85% of our total revenues with international growing 9% operationally and the U.S. growing 7%. Our growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative new products in our companion animal portfolio, which grew 14% operationally. Our companion animal portfolio now makes up 64% of our global revenues. This growth was partially offset by our livestock business, which declined 2% operationally, primarily due to the generic competition, supply constraints as well as challenging market conditions in certain geographies. Performance in companion animal was driven by our small animal parasiticide portfolio, which grew 20% on an operational basis. Simparica Trio generated $744 million in sales, growing 58% on an operational basis. Our Simparica franchise reached $1 billion in global revenue for the first time in 2022. Our key dermatology products generated $1.3 billion in sales posting strong growth of 17% operationally with double-digit growth in both international and the U.S. Key derm growth in our international markets was especially strong at 27% operationally. We continue to see solid growth in our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain. As expected, sales of Librela eclipsed the $100 million mark on the year, marking Zoetis' 15th blockbuster product. We look forward to Librela's expected launch in the U.S. in late 2023. Solensia contributed $30 million in sales in 2022, primarily from international markets, with solid penetration in the U.S. after a launch late in the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 2% operationally in the year, with declines in the U.S., partially offset by growth internationally. Our livestock business declined 2% on an operational basis. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generic and cheaper alternatives to DRAXXIN in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry. We do expect the generic impact to begin to moderate in 2023. Additional declines were driven by supply challenges on certain livestock products as well as unfavorable market conditions, especially the U.S. cattle and China swine markets. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2 billion, representing an increase of 4% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $539 million is an increase of 14% on a reported basis and 27% operationally. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 6% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio as well as Librela and Solensia and 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products grew 1%. Companion animal products grew 15% operationally while our livestock portfolio was flat in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting global revenue of $171 million, representing operational growth of 39% for the quarter. We expect Simparica Trio to continue to grow the addressable market for fleet taking hardware globally and drive the conversion from collar and top parasiticides to oral combination products. These dynamics will provide additional run-rate for future expansion of the broader market and revenue growth for Trio even once competing triple combination products enter the market. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth in the quarter, posting $347 million of revenue, representing 14% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 23% operationally in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats continue to grow posting $39 million of revenue in the quarter, primarily in international markets. Meanwhile, sales of livestock products were flat on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in fish and poultry offset by the impact of generics and supply constraints on cattle and swine products. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal sales growing 12% and livestock sales declining by 6%. Focusing first on companion animal, we returned to double-digit growth in the quarter, as we resolved the majority of our supply issues from earlier in the year. In the U.S. veterinary practice revenue is growing approximately 6% and spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing 10% despite a 4% decline in clinic visits in the quarter. The visit decline reflects comparison to the peak visit numbers in 2021, driven by pandemic after-effects and increased adoption of pets as well as the impact of veterinary workforce challenges that have limited some clinic capacities. Absolute clinic visits remain above pre-pandemic levels. We continue to see growth in the retail segment outpacing other channels. In Q4, sales to our retail partners grew by 49%. Simparica Trio continues to drive growth in the quarter with sales of $158 million in the U.S., growing 39%. With the supply constraints from earlier in the year largely resolved, we were able to leverage promotional efforts to drive growth and regain market share in the quarter. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $239 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint, each growing double-digits. We expect to continue the expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. U.S. livestock declined 6% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by supply restocking for certain products in the third quarter of 2022 as well as the impact of generic competition in cattle and poultry. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 12% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 21% operationally and livestock grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticides portfolio, our key dermatology products and our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain. Our international small animal parasiticide portfolio had a very strong quarter. Growth was driven by revolution franchise, which rebounded well from supply challenges, especially in China. Our key dermatology products contributed $108 million to revenue and grew 22% on an operational basis in the quarter, with growth in Cytopoint across all key markets and continued double-digit growth of Apoquel. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our oral pain portfolio with Librela generating $26 million and Solensia delivering $7 million in fourth quarter sales internationally. Librela sales in the quarter dipped slightly below the prior quarter due to the removal of supply allocation in certain markets, which led to higher inventory levels at the end of Q3. We expect to see significant contribution to growth in 2023 coming from Librela across our International segment. Moving on to our International Livestock segment, which grew 4% operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 25% operationally due to increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of poultry products grew due to increased demand for poultry protein. Growth was partially offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints in certain vaccines across international. The slight decline was partially offset by growth in China, driven by a weak comparative quarter in the prior year and improved swine market conditions. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 68.1% decreased 150 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin declined 60 basis points, driven by higher inventory charges as well as higher manufacturing and freight costs, which were partially offset by favorable price and mix. Operationally, adjusted operating expenses decreased 6% with SG&A declining 9% driven by lower compensation-related expenses and lower advertising and promotion, partially offset by higher freight and logistics related expenses. R&D expenses increased 10% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher project spend. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%, an increase of 220 basis points, primarily due to lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and a lower benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. Adjusted net income grew 27% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 30% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $171 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $400 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. For the year, we have repurchased almost $1.6 billion of Zoetis shares and returned over $2.2 billion to shareholders. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income. Now moving on to our guidance for the full year 2023, please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have a minimal impact versus the prior year, with the full year impact neutral at revenue and slightly accretive at adjusted net income. The foreign exchange impact in the first half will be unfavorable versus prior year, particularly in the first quarter. In the second half of the year, foreign exchange is expected to be favorable based on the late January exchange rates. For 2023, we are projecting revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. Volume will be 1% to 2% at the low end of our guidance range and 3% to 4% at the high end. We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2023 with the continued strength of our diverse Simparica Trio portfolio, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and further expansion of our key dermatology products. Despite the decline in vet planning visits last year, industry fundamentals remain strong. Business remain above pre-COVID levels and clinic revenue is at an all-time high as the standard of care continues to increase. We anticipate modest livestock declines in 2023, driven by the generic impact on DRAXXIN sales, particularly in the first half as well as unfavorable market conditions in U.S. cattle. These declines will be partially offset by growth in poultry, driven by increased demand for poultry protein and new product launches as well as fish. The fundamental trends which make livestock an essential business remain intact. I'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectation for revenue growth. For companion animal, we assume a triple combination product we will launch in the U.S. in the first half of 2023 to compete against Simparica Trio. We expect this entrant will help Trio drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination or parasiticides and still project significant growth for Trio. We do not expect competitive entrants in 2023 for our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. We expect another year of robust growth of our key derm portfolio coming from continued expansion of the dermatology market and price. We are excited about the continued growth in our OA franchise and plan to launch in several new markets next year. For the remainder of the P&L, adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 29.5% to 30%, where favorable foreign exchange price increases and product mix are partially offset by higher input costs. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.06 billion and $2.1 billion, with the increase from 2022 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2023, is expected to be between $635 million and $660 million. R&D spend can fluctuate year-over-year. This increased investment is reflective of both new projects as well as those advancing in our pipeline. Zoetis is the leader in animal health because of the disruptive innovation, novel products and life cycle enhancements we bring to the market. This increase in R&D expenses reflects our commitment to ensuring our capital allocation prioritizes innovation. Adjusted interest and other income reductions are expected to be approximately $170 million. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2023 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion, representing operational growth of 7% to 9%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14. We are anticipating capital expenditures in 2023 to increase to $950 million to $1 billion. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage. Finally, Zoetis and the animal health industry remain resilient in the face of economic headwinds. Our 2023 guidance range is reflective of uncertain macroeconomic conditions and the impact of veterinary clinic labor challenges. While guidance represents our expectations for the full year, Q1 revenue is expected to be below the low end of the operational growth rate in our full year guidance due to a variety of reasons. First, Q1 2022 was a strong comparable quarter as we saw robust growth with limited impact from vet clinic labor constraints as well as minimal disruption from our diagnostics field force model change, which began in Q2. Additionally, in the quarter, we expect to see lingering impacts of the latest COVID wave in China. Lastly, the return of supply on certain products, including Simparica Trio, and subsequent channel restocking as well as promotions to regain share in Q4 2022 modestly increased inventory levels in the channel in the short-term. In Q1, we expect a modest decline in adjusted net income versus the prior year as a result of the timing of our 2022 sales force extension in the U.S., which did not start until Q2, as well as the R&D investment noted earlier, which is also off a low base in Q1 2022. Now to summarize. 2022 was another strong year despite some challenges, we significantly outperformed the market and continue to take share, all while growing the bottom line faster than the top line. As we begin 2023, we once again expect to grow faster than the market, driven by the strength of our innovative portfolio, our ability to successfully launch new products and expand existing markets and our confidence in the end market dynamics for the spaces we compete in. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? No. Look, I'll just add a couple of points. Going back to Trio, we expect, as Kristin said, for Trio to grow significantly in the year, although as we now are well into our third year with a product, we wouldn't expect it to continue to grow at 58%, which is what it did in 2022. Now the timing of our supply recovery in 2022 and the fact that as we see competition come in, it may drive some promotional activities that might drive some variability in terms of quarter-to-quarter in terms of where the growth is. But for the total year, we expect significant growth on Trio. And then on the R&D spend, it's our practice that we don't actually dictate what the investment in R&D is going to be. We let the pipeline dictated. And so as we see programs either coming into research or coming out of research into development or into late development as those programs require spending, and we do a full ROI spec, etcetera, on them, we go ahead and fund those. And so we're very pleased to see that the pipeline is demanding this level of investment and we will still be able to deliver faster growth at ANI in revenue based on our guide of 6% to 8% of revenue and 7% to 9% at adjusted net income. Yes. So I'll start and see if Kristin would add anything here. Let's start with gross margins. Look, if you look at the year, we were able to expand margins on the year. And certainly, as we explained in the prepared commentary, we saw FX come in to the tune of about 80 basis point headwind against gross margin in the fourth quarter. And certainly, we've seen input costs or some manufacturing costs impact the gross margin picture that you saw in the fourth quarter. But given where OpEx came in, you saw substantial growth at ANI versus revenue where revenue came in at 9% in the quarter ANI coming and 27% growth in the quarter. I think as we go into 2023, given the timing of our price increases, which started at the beginning of the year, as you know, certainly, we've seen some inflation in input costs coming out of \u201822, but we go into \u201823 price increases that start to change that as we go into \u201823, which is why we give guidance where we see about 40 basis point margin \u2013 gross margin expansion on the year. And obviously, a point, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance on growth higher at ANI versus the top line is what I would say on the margin point. And certainly, as you look at continued growth of companion animal outpacing the growth of livestock in the business, that mix will be favorable to us in addition to what I already covered from a price perspective. I think if you look at the atopic derm, we delivered $1.3 billion of revenue in 2022, that's a 17% increase. And we're almost at 10 years since Apoquel was launched and it's just amazing to see that we continue to expand the market, and we believe there is more room to expand not only in the U.S., where we grew 12% in 2022, but particularly in international markets, it takes longer to get to peak sales levels, and we delivered 27% growth in international. I think we will continue to see really solid growth across the business. We have had double-digit growth in 2023. Though it may not be at the level that you've seen in 2021, where we grew to think about 23% and then 17% in 2022, but we continue to see room to continue to expand the derm market here. Yes. So let me first touch on your questions around supply, and it's Trio as well as other products. As we said in the third quarter call, while we had some outages in supply during the year, particularly in the third quarter, competitors actually took advantage of that and run promotions. And we certainly intended to run promotions as we recovered on supply, which we did in the fourth quarter. And so I think the timing of our supply recovery, whether it's for Trio in the U.S. or for Revolution in China will drive some stocking levels, certainly as we enter into 2023, which we discussed. But I think typically, you'll see some increase in inventory levels from Q3 to Q4 anyway, because distributors are anticipating our price increases and the intent to drive a little bit of that. So I would say when I look at across other products, it's probably more in the range of typical increase that you would see. But if you look at Trio, we're probably, if I had to bracket it in terms of the impact on Trio, if you back out, what would typically be an increase from Q3 to Q4 anyway. So the incremental contribution in the fourth quarter, I'd put somewhere in the $25 million to $30 million range. So it's not a significant number for us. And certainly, as we discussed already, we factored that into our guidance, and we expect significant growth from Trio on the year. With respect to Librela, look, we continue to expect and I'm very confident that we will see an approval in a well in the first half of the year, our plans have not changed. We continue to plan to have an early experience program run on the program once we've gotten approval and we have the label set, etcetera, and that will transition into a launch sometime late in the year. Yes. And we will give a better bracket in terms of what we expect the impact depending on the timing of the launch and what we see through the EEP program, etcetera. Yes, I'll take that. And see Kristin would add on anything. We are investing in a number of areas when it comes to our supply network, upload a couple of categories, I'd say, in the short \u2013 near-term, we have investments clearly in inventory to help absorb any shocks that come through the supply chain. We're making investments in our demand planning processes and tools to give us better visibility etcetera as well as we don't see that we are building in, in certain aspects of our inputs now coming into our manufacturing process. Longer term, as you may have listened on the prepared commentary, we're making significant capital investments across our network across the network in the U.S. to support our monoclonal antibodies, both for products that have already been approved and are launching. And what we have in our pipeline is well from a math perspective. It is a platform that we continue to innovate on. And then all solid dose as well, whether it's parasiticides, derm session in various aspects. We are making investments throughout the network for those we're making investments to support our vector vaccine manufacturing, for example, as well for livestock and so on. So we are making investments across the organization, investments in tech and digital to leverage data again, to give us better visibility as well for the long-term to support our long-term growth aspirations. Yes, absolutely. Look, as we said from the very beginning, we were expecting DRAXXIN to have about 20% decline in the first year of generic competition and then another 20% in the second year. The first year was slightly better than our expectations coming in somewhere around 16% decline. But the second year was a little bit worse. So, I think we are sort of in that ballpark. I think the second year is about 25%. So, we are at a level now that once we lap, I would say, the second year, which would be through the first quarter of \u201823, which is why in the previous commentary, we said, particularly in the first quarter, I think we are at a low enough level, won't be as meaningful as an impact on us, and I think the drag on our overall are stock business won't be as significant. So, I would still expect some pressure on livestock given where U.S. cattle, for example, as a market is we are watching swine, particularly in China and anti [ph] has across other regions to determine where we end up lending. But we think livestock will be slightly down year-on-year, maybe marginally better than we \u2013 than you saw in 2023, where livestock was down 2%. Yes. Look, it's only small addition I will do to Trio is we do get to 100% heartworm after the first dose. So \u2013 and with the product being in the market almost 3 years and satisfaction levels being very high and penetration across clinics, etcetera, we are very confident on our position as competition enters into the space. On R&D, look, I think unlike human health in animal health is not as much visibility as given with respect to what's being specifically worked in the pipeline, we see that as a competitive advantage for us given our track record and how we continue to drive innovation in the spaces that we enter. And so we won't necessarily be changing that significantly here in terms of what we have in here, but we have talked about various aspects of unmet needs that if you were to ask veterinary practitioners, what are the top 5 or 10 unmet needs that they have, I think you would imagine that we are working on all of those areas. Yes. So, look, I think if you look at our 2022 results, the net price contribution is about 3%. Now if you take vaccine out, that number is about 4% and companion animal would be at the higher number here, with certain products essentially above that. Now, we are very pleased to be able to take price, which typically is about 2% to 3%. And here in 2022, it was about double what we would normally do, and we still saw about 5% volume growth in 2022. So, as we look at 2023, I think you would see price with DRAXXIN impact being less than it was in \u201823 in particular, plus how we are going into price in certain products, I think you are going to expect a higher price contribution on the year, the timing of that in terms of where customers may have bought ahead of the price increases and so on. So, you might see a little bit of a lag in terms of when you see the price picture play out, but you would see at the low end of our range, but it's a bigger contributor. But at the upper end, it's all additional volume. In terms of where we see clinic traffic, certainly, we have seen vet visits come down versus the peak that we saw in 2021. In the fourth quarter, visits were down about 4%, but revenue per visit was up 10% and total revenue was up 6% on the quarter. Again, continuing the trends that we see as being sustainable which is pet owners willing to pay for innovation and seeing sustainably higher revenue for pet clinics. Now, we are still very early in 2023. But as we look at data, in January, we are seeing some increases in vet visits. Again, as we expected, we have been running above pre-pandemic levels. So, even in Q4, where visits were down 12%, they were actually still 2% above Q4 2019. And so we have been saying that, that's the element to continue to watch. I think one month is a little bit early to call it, but we are expecting visits business to be flat to up in 2023, and we are starting to see some signals of that earlier in the year. Look, it's great to be here in Denver with a large number of our colleagues on Valentine's Day. But look, I think China, we have been very pleased to see how China ended the year high-double digit growth on the quarter. My comments around supply was just the timing of recovery, particularly on revolution, Revolution Plus in that market that might create some dynamics on quarter-to-quarter. But we are expecting really solid growth out of China this year. I think the first quarter though, given the timing of the COVID waves. Just as a reminder, our international segment closes in \u2013 at the end of November, which means the quarter really started in December for them. And so a lot of that occurred in the first quarter, and we are seeing that having an impact, but we do see a rebound and as Kristin said, it has implications for other markets in terms of exports into China, but we are expecting a really solid rebound there. Yes. So, look, I think across the macro elements, we have been appropriately prudent in how we have laid out this guidance in the range that we have given today. But specifically on gross margins, if you look at inflation, as we are preparing to come into the year, we are certainly accounting for significant inflationary pressure on some of our input costs, energy, Europe, etcetera. But as we have entered the year, I think they are a little bit better than what we anticipated coming into the year, but still significant inflation that's baked into what we have here, which obviously are more than offset by our mix and our price, which is why you see some modest gross margin improvement year-on-year as we go through the year. But we have factored in a fairly significant inflationary pressure in the gross margin figures that we gave. Yes. So, look, when you look at our capital allocation priorities, certainly investing in the business is the first place we go. And clearly, we are poised to significantly invest in the areas of R&D as well as across our supply chain and manufacturing \u2013 you saw the significant increase in R&D spend anticipated for 2023 versus 2022. And our CapEx numbers are going to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion on the year. Certainly, as you look at our strategic priorities, they are aligned with where we look at from a BD perspective in terms of where there might be opportunities to accelerate some of those execution on our strategies. And they span across our current slate of businesses, including some of the R&D areas in terms of external innovation and so on. BD is one of those areas, as you know, is hard to predict in terms of exact timing and so on, but it is an important lever that I would say, second after investing in the business. And then thirdly, as you saw in 2022, we are returning capital to shareholders to the tune of $2.2 billion in total between share buybacks and dividends. Alright. I think you had a question \u2013 sorry, I think you had a question in terms of new pets. Look, if you look at the growth in the industry over the last two decades, it's been about 5% to 6%. The way I look at it, vet visits, in essence, as you see pet population growth and so on, it would be reflected in that. They have accounted for about 1% of that growth historically. So, the bigger element of growth here is really pet owners' willingness to spend for innovation, and you see that reflected in the spend per visit figures that are far more in terms of the impact on growth historically, and we anticipate that continuing. So, as you sit here today, I wouldn't say new pet increases is a major factor into what we are looking at. It's our innovation and pet owners willing to pay. And the demographics of pet ownership with Gen Z and millennials willing to spend more on pet health and prioritizing those as well as higher income households that are bringing pets and more pets into their homes. Those are the factors that we watch that contribute to growth."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. And that, actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or US GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 3, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2022. While the world faces a dynamic external environment and uncertainty in the global economy, our business has been tested and continues to perform well, based on our diverse durable portfolio and global footprint. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results with 5% operational revenue growth, reflecting steady performance across our innovation-driven companion animal portfolio, especially in our international markets. Our international business grew 8% operationally and the US grew 2% in the quarter. As we've been saying for some time, supply challenges throughout the year remain a headwind to meeting global demand, and those impacts were more pronounced in the third quarter. Supply has been improving in certain product categories, such as parasiticides, and we continue prioritizing supply for key products and markets. However, we do expect constraints in some categories to continue. Overall, positive pet care trends in terms of increasing spend and pet owner demographics continue to underpin the strength of our business. With 10% operational growth in companion animal products in the third quarter, we continue to see strong demand globally for Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, small animal vaccine and monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia. In the US, supply constraints for companion animal products tempered some of our expected growth in the quarter, and we also experienced an impact related to workforce challenges in veterinary clinics. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID rates, as clinics struggle with capacity issues. That being said, average revenues per visit continue to rise in the US as pet owners place a premium on the care of their pets, a positive long-term trend. This commitment to pet well-being is also demonstrated in the success of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela and Solensia. They are performing exceptionally well in the EU and Solensia is on track after being launched in the US at the end of the third quarter. We are investing in building a feline market for pain treatment and undertreated condition for cats. Outside of the US, companion animal products showed strong growth of 17% operationally. In some of our largest markets like China and Australia, we're seeing our innovative pet care products contributing more and more to growth in these traditionally live stock-driven markets. Meanwhile, our global livestock business performed largely as expected in the third quarter, with a decline of 3% operationally. We continue to face generic competition for livestock products, especially in cattle and poultry, and we face supply constraints in products such as vaccines. However, we are seeing solid pockets of growth, especially in aquaculture and poultry products and certain markets outside the US. As we stabilize from the generic competition, and review more consistent supply, we will improve our livestock performance. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the innovation-driven strength of our business especially in areas such as parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. I am optimistic about the fundamental growth drivers and essential nature of the animal health industry to weather challenging times. However, we are revising our full year guidance to affect lower-than-expected sales in the second half of the year due to supply constraints, veterinary workforce challenges and recent changes to foreign exchange rates. We believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view, given the increasing uncertainty around supply, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions that have become less predictable. As we look ahead, to our tenth anniversary as an independent company next year and I reflect on all that we've achieved in the last decade, I feel very positive about where we are and the capabilities we have to overcome any challenges we face. Historically, we've always been able to adapt our business to meet evolving customer needs, drive growth faster than the market and achieve our purpose in nurturing the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. The human animal bond and people's connection to pets and farm animals is powerful. It's a bond we support with a diverse portfolio that remains the strength of our business, and we see strong global demand for innovative products, especially in companion animal parasiticides, dermatology, vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibodies for pain. Positive pet owner demographics and their willingness to spend on the care of their animals remain long-term sustainable drivers of growth, despite some of the workforce challenges in clinics and livestock continues to be an important part of our business, an area where we drive significant value for our customers and shareholders. To sustain our growth, innovation remains our lifeblood, and we continue investing in the industry's leading R&D engine at Zoetis. Our monoclonal antibody portfolio for OA pain is a game changer. It has been performing exceptionally well as a pet treatment and growth driver in an increasing number of markets, and Librela is expected to be a blockbuster for Zoetis in 2022. In terms of the US approval for Librela, we have confirmed dates for the FDA site inspections outside the US, but their timing makes it unlikely to have an approval this year. Given our ongoing conversations with the FDA, we are confident in receiving approval in the first half of 2023 with a launch planned for late in the year. In closing, our business continues to perform well in a dynamic market and we are well positioned to advance our strategic growth opportunities in parasiticides, dermatology, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. Even as we face challenging supply constraints, generic competition and macroeconomic uncertainty, I remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues, as we finish 2022 and we go into 2023. Given the importance of the companionship and nutrition provided by pets and farm minimals and the power of the human animal bond, the animal health industry has consistently grown in the mid-single digits, even in down markets. And as the leader in animal health, we have the pipeline, market leadership positions, global scale and financial strength to continue outpacing the market. Throughout the last 10 years in various market conditions, we have grown the top line an average of about 8%. And even in the last recession, when our business was more livestock than companion animal, we still grew. As we look toward the end of the year and into 2023, I expect us to continue setting the bar on innovation, cultivating a high-performing culture and delivering superior customer experiences. All of this will have us growing significantly above the market and building enduring value for shareholders in this dynamic market. Thank you. Now let me hand things over to Wetteny.\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a solid quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises, driven by our companion animal performance, especially in international. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 1% on a reported basis and 5% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $566 million declined 5% on a reported basis and grew 2% on an operational basis. Of the 5% operational revenue growth, 4% is from volume and 1% from price. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela an Solensia and 1% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 1%. The decline was largely the result of supply challenges. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 10% operationally, with livestock declining 3% on an operational basis in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $172 million, representing operational growth of 43% versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flee, tick and heartworm globally and see significant room for growth with brands like Simparica Trio, Simparica, ProHeart and Revolution Plus. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth, especially internationally, with $343 million of revenue, representing 11% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products grew 26% operationally. Year-to-date revenue is $966 million, representing 18% operational growth. Sales of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in International continue to exceed expectations, posting $37 million of sales in the quarter. Switching to Diagnostics. Our global Companion Animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $78 million in revenue in Q3, declining 9% operationally. Despite declining revenues, we saw solid new instrument placements in the quarter. The decline in our US diagnostics portfolio was partially offset by growth internationally in the quarter. In the US, our diagnostics results were also impacted by the vet clinic workforce challenges, and we continue to experience a slowdown in sales as we transition to our new go-to-market model and build out a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run. We expect the effectiveness of our new diagnosis field force to improve gradually into 2023. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Meanwhile, sales of lifestyle products declined by 3% operationally in the quarter. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to Draxxin in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry and supply challenges for certain products. Our fish portfolio grew 19% operationally in the quarter and along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 2%, with companion animal sales growing 6% and livestock sales declining by 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. The effects of our ongoing supply challenges were more pronounced in the third quarter, tempering growth in our parasiticides. In US companion animal, we are also seeing vet clinic workforce challenges limiting appointment availability as visits declined 4% in the quarter. Despite lower visits, practice revenue is growing approximately 5% and as spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing more than 9%. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID levels, as the impact of higher pet ownership growth rates due to COVID normalize and vet practices deal with workforce challenges. However, underlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country, even as people return to work. While vet clinic workforce challenges do exist, we believe vet clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better pet ownership demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Even with the robust comparative year, we continue to see volume growth in our companion animal products, driven by our innovative products, such as Trio and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $157 million in the US, growing 43%. Despite the impact of supply constraints and the vet clinic workforce challenges, we continue to take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio. Key dermatology products sales in the US were $231 million for the quarter, growing 6% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our US derm portfolio has grown 12%. Growth is tempered by prior year cover related spice in derm visits that drive visit growth of 25% in Q3, 2021, and help accelerate market expansion. This growth was also impacted by the ongoing pet clinic workforce challenges. We expect continued expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. US livestock declined 7% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by generic competition for Jackson. Meanwhile, our US poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. US swine product sales declined 3% in the quarter, driven primarily by increased competition for vaccines. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue declined 2% on a reported basis and grew 8% operationally in the quarter. International Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue was flat operationally. Increased sales of comparing animal products resulted from growth of monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products, and Simparica Trio. We remain excited with the long-term prospects of these innovative brands and expect future direct-to-consumer advertising to help drive additional growth. Sales of companion animal vaccines also contributed to growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $31 million and Solensia delivering $6 million in third quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year, a new blockbuster for Zoetis. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the number one pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. We saw volume growth in our international companion animal portfolio in the third quarter and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Meanwhile, international livestock was flat operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 19% operationally and experienced increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of sheep products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. Growth was offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints across international and lower sales across Europe due to reduced exports to China and higher input costs for producers. Sales in Brazil also declined as we are seeing supply challenges on cattle products. Additionally, inflationary impacts on consumer spending are driving consumption away from beef to lower-cost animal proteins such as pork and chicken and reducing reducer profitability. Lastly, the Jurox acquisition, which is based in Australia, was completed on September 30 and is not reflected in our Q3 results. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 90 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin slightly declined, driven by higher manufacturing, freight and other costs, which were largely offset by favorable mix and price. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% operationally, with SG&A growth of 3% operationally, driven by T&E costs beginning to return to pre-COVID levels as well as freight and logistics. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher operating costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, an increase of 420 basis points due to unfavorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including decreased favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income in the prior year period. And finally, adjusted net income grew 2% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $154 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $375 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we have repurchased almost $1.2 billion of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are lowering our growth to 7% to 8%, previously 9.5% to 10.5%. We are also lowering our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 9% to 11%, previously 11% to 13%. This change in guidance is reflective of our Q3 results, continued impact from supply challenges and the ongoing veterinary workforce challenges. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late October and reflect the continued strengthening of the US dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to lowering of our guidance and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.0 billion and $8.075 billion. We lowered our operating expense guidance for the full year, reflecting lower expenses in both Q3 and Q4, which reflects our ability to manage costs. Additionally, it is worth noting that our expected Q4 expense decline is also impacted by an easier comp due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter last year. Additionally, our guidance for adjusted interest expense and OID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.83 to $4.90 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59. While lower, our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term. Our success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation and our infrastructure to develop and expand market globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on key growth opportunities for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nErin Wright: Great. Thank you for taking my question. So when we think about some of these headwinds and tailwinds related to 2022, what is now proving to be more challenging than anticipated? Is it mostly the supply chain issues, or is it other factors here? And can you quantify the supply chain constraints, what sales would have been excluding these dynamics? And then, how should we think about those broader headwinds and tailwinds from an operational perspective into 2023, as we think about both livestock and companion animal, should low single-digit livestock growth in 2023 be the right way to think about it? And then, if that's the case, how do we think about companion animal operational growth in 2023? And I'll stop there. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Aaron. I'll start and I'll let Wetteny build on this one. I mean, I think, the first thing to start with is fundamentally and structurally the veterinary business and importantly, demand for our products remains stronger than it was before COVID. I think we've got still a very healthy business. If you look at sort of the headwinds as we looked at the second half of this year, by far, supply was the biggest, and I'll let Wetteny comment on sort of sizing them I would say that was the significant driver for us in Q3. And as we look into Q4, I mean, certainly, we can talk about vet clinic visits as well. But I think for us, we really believe that the supply issues that we were facing were really the primary driver for us. And as we look into 2023, I think the really good news around that is -- as we look at the ones we faced this year, as we talked about supply from the beginning of the year, we had MABS issues. We worked through that. We're now in full supply on our MABS in all the markets that we've launched in. So I think that one is one we've addressed. We did have paras challenges in Q2, Q3, honestly, our supply came in too late in Q3. And I think if you look at Simparica Trio in particular, our competitors took advantage of the top shelves. And so it's taken us a little longer to get back on shelf than we had hoped. But again, I think the paras problem will work itself out as you look into Q4. We have challenges as well in Rev. for Rev and Simparica, Q3 is a really important quarter for us. And so I think you saw that. I think, again, the really good news is demand remains strong for these products, and we've addressed most of those supply issues. There'll be some small ongoing ones, as you know, in our industry, Aaron, you followed us a long time. We always have challenges around vaccines. When you supply as many products as we do across as many species globally, there's always some level of it, and some of those will continue into next year. But we're really confident that the biggest challenges we were anticipating this year around MAB have been addressed. As you look at paras, both Trio and Rev, we'll work through that by the end of this year. We have really clear plans in place. I mean, obviously, there'll be some ongoing one in vaccines, but that's more usual, of course, but Wetteny, do you want to sort of get some for second and third questions?\nWetteny Joseph: Yeah, sure. Erin, as we've been saying throughout this year, supply certainly remains a headwind to meeting global demand. And as Kristin mentioned, the timing of recovery on some of these is very important. So as we went throughout the year and face supply constraints, particularly in Trio, despite the fact that Trio has performed really well for us, growing 65% on a year-to-date basis. The reality is, we had outages throughout the peak parasiticide season for Trio to Q2 and Q3, though we recovered late in Q3, the impact was such that we allowed competitors to be more aggressive about placing products on shelves, which we saw that impact as we exited Q3. But going forward, we do anticipate continuing to see some impact for Revolution, Revolution Plus, where we are selectively looking at key markets to deliver those products against others. So that is something that we're carrying into the fourth quarter, and we have reflected in the guidance that we have issued today. So while our business faces other impacts outside of supply, whether it's workforce or macro in certain markets. By far, the supply constraints are the biggest impact here, looking at how we've seen the year sort of transition versus what we saw earlier. And so, if you look at the guidance change here of about $200 million reduction in guidance, I would say, FX and supply account for more than 75% of that, with supply being by far the largest majority of that.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please, go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks. And I have a quick follow-up on that last point and then touch on something else. So on the supply issues, I think a lot of what you just commented on, Kristin and Wetteny was that, as you guys have these challenges in the quarter, your competitors took advantage of stock shelves. How should we think about that longer term? Is that a temporary switch over? Meaning, can you gain that back once you resolve especially some of the older products of Revolution, but also Trio, whether that happens this quarter or next quarter, are you going to be able to push those competitors out of those positions easily, or is that something that\u2019s going to be a little bit more of a challenge to regain your footing there? And then, I also want to touch on Librela approval. It seems like that time line has slipped a little bit with the OUS inspection date. I'm just wondering, how does that change your launch expectations and ramp expectations in the United States. I mean, you talked about second half 2023 or later in 2023 launch. So just walk us through the dynamics there. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start and I'll let Wetteny build on this one. As you think about competitors, yes, I am very confident that we will get our shelf space back, and there's -- this is -- I very much see this as temporary. We're not worried as Wetteny said, this product is really well received by our customers and by pet owners. It's growing 65% on the year. So I am very confident we will get that back. So I see that absolutely as temporary. So I think the other important thing here as we look at Simparica Trio, in particular, is that, when it comes to competition, the latest update we have is we are no longer expecting competition early in 2023 based on what we're hearing. As always, this is hard as a private company, and no one gives us much information on some of the private companies here and that a lot of them are not public, but our basic intelligence at this point is, we don't see something launching against us as well early in the year, and we'll clearly leverage that opportunity to gain share as well. So I think that is also incremental news as we think about Trio. And when it comes to Librela, I mean, obviously, we were hoping for an approval this year, depending on when we get it next year, we just have to -- everything moves based on what that is. So we're still obviously hoping for a launch as we expected. But without knowing the exact timing of the approval into next year, it just moves proportionately, as you probably know. So I think that's just the only incremental news there. We're confident, well, no matter what, we'll get a launch next year. But the timing of it is just we'll have to update it once we get the final approval on that. I don't know, Wetteny, did I miss anything there?\nWetteny Joseph: I'll just add a couple of points on Trio. Look, if you look at combination, flee, tick, heartworm, it's still a relatively new standard of care. And what you continue to see is in this very important part of the market, which is north of $5 billion globally. This expansion going from topicals and orals -- topicals and collars into orals and then now with triple combinations, we'll continue to expand that into the market and grow the market as well. So even with competition, we expect to continue to grow. So this dynamic that we described that occurred as we exited Q3 -- between Q2 and Q3, we see that as a temporary effect, and we'll continue to drive our share here. And particularly, since we are not anticipating a delay in terms of competition, though it's hard to say exactly when it will come. It could come in 2023, but we don't expect it early in the year. With respect to Librela, what I would say is, we continue to be extremely pleased and the product continues to perform better than our expectations across Europe. And though we've had capacity constraints that didn't allow us to be able to take full advantage of demand this year and we've had to actually make trade-offs in terms of delaying launches in other markets. As we exit the year, we anticipate next year being able to launch the product in additional markets outside the US and outside of Europe. And the product, again, continues to perform really well for us. So we're very pleased with that. And so this sort of delay in terms of when the actual approval will happen in the US, given the dynamics we're seeing in terms of the expansion of 40% of the dogs that have been put on the product and new to the market. The less of time duration of use of the product, et cetera, all bode well for sort of continued growth in this area and expansion of the pain market beyond the timing of the launch, et cetera.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thanks for the questions. I had a follow-up on the supply constraints as well. Wetteny, it seems like based on your commentary on the second half revenue revision, the supply constraints would be something like a 200 to 300 basis point impact on second half volumes. I just wondered to see if that number is in the right ballpark. And as we think about the go forward, will there be a headwind in 4Q? It sounded like those -- a large majority of the constraints that may have been resolved by the end of the third quarter. Just wanted to see what we should expect for the third -- for the fourth quarter, excuse me. And then into 2023, would you anticipate there to be any lingering supply constraints or should everything be resolved at that point? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So, look, what I would say is, supply issue is not unique to us, given the wide variety of products and species. It's relatively commonplace in this industry, as I've learned coming in about a year-and-a-half ago. I think the level that we're seeing now is certainly elevated over the last couple of years. And in particular, we saw more of an impact here in Q3, given the timing of our recovery on some of these, right? So I do think we expect to see some continued impact into Q4, but we reflected those in the guidance that we just issued today. I mentioned Revolution, for example, being one of them and quite frankly, throughout the years in the MABS where we are confident in our ability to fulfill demand next year, not only in Europe but other markets outside of Europe. We've made trade-offs in MABS even between, for example, Cytopoint and Librela, right? So I do think those impacts have had their effects on this year. But as we go into next year, we're confident in those. I think vaccines is an area that you typically see certain supply constraints in and challenges, and I think we'll continue to see those into 2024 and as we exit the year, we'll continue to make progress on Revolution, but it is certainly having an impact on the fourth quarter as well is what I would say. Of course, we'll have a lot more color to provide on the next call with respect to 2023, but we feel confident on the biggest products that have the greatest impacts. If you look at Trio from a parasiticide perspective, confidence in terms of supply going into next year. And for our MABS, particularly Librela launches, et cetera, and for Cytopoint for next year, we feel very confident about that as well. So those are big movers for us going into 2023.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So I wanted to ask you with the potential competition coming for some of your key products next year. Do you still think you can grow through those if they do come next year? And then second question I had for you is on innovation and livestock. When do you see that next phase of innovation and when will we possibly see growth getting beyond that sort of 3% to 4% that we've seen historically for a while? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Louise, in your first question with regards to competition, I think the good news is we're not expecting competition early in the year anymore on Trio. But regardless of when competition arises, I do think we'll continue to grow through this. If you look at this category, even when [indiscernible] were introduced and you saw one then two then three, this category grew, we launched a triple combination, and we grew incredibly well. I think there was plenty of space here. Wetteny mentioned earlier, there's still movement from topicals and collars and this is a really innovative category. So I do believe you'll continue to see growth. As you look at dermatology, I would say the same thing. I think a competitor can help us continue to grow this market. There are still 6 million untreated dogs. The usage of this product in international is still significantly below that of the US when you have the same number of dogs with the conditions. So we continue to believe there is growth across these. Obviously, growth may decelerate in derm with a competitor, but I still think these are going to be growing markets. I think the innovation. And don't forget, we continue to look at life cycle enhancements for all of these products. We are not stopping with what we have. So I think there's a lot of visibility into a competitor might come, but not necessarily some of the innovations in these key product categories that we'll continue to do. With regards to innovation and livestock, Wetteny, do you want to take that one with regards to growth rates?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, I think if you look at livestock, as we said, this is a segment that has grown in the sort of 3% to 4% range historically. And given the impact that we're seeing from generic competition for Draxxin, Zoamix, et cetera, we've been performing below that. But as we sit here, if we, for example, were to pro forma out the Draxxin impact, you would see growth in our livestock business, even in the quarter that we delivered negative 3 on Q3, which is similar to last quarter. And so, I think, as we look to exit this year, I think livestock will be slightly below the performance you saw in Q3, given the intensification of some of the generic competition. But beyond that, as we look beyond out exiting 2023 into 2024, et cetera, we'll have to take a look at what the macro is. I think if you look at cattle in key markets across Brazil, and elsewhere in the US, we'll have to really continue to look at what the macro is. But in terms of innovation, we continue to make innovation that, quite frankly, you're not seeing the impact of them in the current year because of the impact of generic competition. So if you look at inhibition in terms of poultry with vector vaccines that we're starting to launch in the US. If you look at some of our swine vaccines that we're launching elsewhere, we've had some supply constraints in those as well. So you're not seeing the full effect of those. But beyond this year and beyond the generic competition is that sort of supply pull, you start to see growth coming out of our livestock business. I just want to make one more point going back to derm. We don't -- last earnings, we said we don't see competition for derm in the first half of next year. Now, three months later, there's still no new news, right? And so, I think, as you know, in the space, it's not that we have specific data on what folks have. And so, it's about a six-month time frame that we look ahead. And three months later, we still don't see anything. So it's not to say that we expect competition next year is just we don't have any data that says there will be any in the first half. So I just want to make that clarifying point as you asked the question around competition next year.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.\nJon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll ask both upfront. I think the 2022 out margin was, I believe, largely unchanged despite the lower revenue. And Wetteny, you mentioned managing OpEx, but I think you guys also wanted to invest, you've got some notable new opportunities in front of you. So how do we think about that? In other words, is this an OpEx push on the investment into 2023, or should we still expect the bottom line growing decently above the top line next year 2023? And then Kristin, just to shift gears, can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on, call it, the company's line of sight into these supply constraints fully resolving in 2023. At least for me, it seemed like the Trio issue came as a little bit of a surprise. And maybe just a tack on to that, do we think of these sales as lost, fully lost or at least a portion push? Because I would think from a consumer to go from -- to a triple and then back to a duo, is there something where some of these can be recouped in the early part of 2023? Thanks, guys.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So I'll take the first part of the question in terms of how we see margins and investments, et cetera. We've made a number of investments across the business, whether you look at what we're doing in R&D, what we've done with respect to our field force, and we'll continue to do across the diagnostics in our pet care field force, for example, in the US, we're making investments across our supply chain and manufacturing, obviously, given the demand we're seeing across our products and anticipated launches of other products out into the future. So we'll continue to make those investments, but we do have the ability to manage discretionary spend and you see that play out in the third quarter, where OpEx was below top line growth. And in fact, other than the tax rate difference to last year, if you look at our earnings before taxes, those grew at 8% on a 5% top line growth. So you see that leverage playing out in the P&L. And we have the ability to continue to do that. And I think we'll continue to use price to drive margins. The mix is favorable to us, given companion animal continues to grow faster than livestock. So companion animal grew 10% in the quarter where livestock declined 3%. So that mix is favorable to us, although, we see some offset with respect to inflation and so on, but you continue to see those drivers, and we can anticipate those going into next year. So we'll continue to make investments in select areas, again, prioritizing R&D prioritizing manufacturing and supply chain, for example, but we'll manage discretionary spend elsewhere to still deliver a leveraged P&L, which is what we've said. Now there may be quarters, where that doesn't play out exactly. But I think if you look at a year, you will see us continue to do that. And that margin between top line growth and bottom line growth may be less than what the business naturally can do, but that's because we're making investments where we see the need, but we will still manage to deliver annually a leveraged P&L is our target.\nKristin Peck: And sure, I'll take your second question around visibility into supply resolution. When we started the year, like many companies across many different sectors, we knew supply challenges would be there waiting on things as you look at ones where -- to your point, were we a little surprised by what happened with specifically Trio and Rev. I mean the honest answer is yes, we thought they would resolve faster. It's not that we weren't aware this was a capacity issue. We needed to build capacity and specifically some of this at a third party. And honestly, getting that third party on took us a little longer than we expected. We set a really an OpEx team over there to try to work on it and the timing of the resolution took us longer than we expected on that one. Why am I have visibility to why I say it's better, because we're having a weekly call, I'm looking at their output on a weekly basis for both Revolution and Trio, and they're doing really well. I think they're delivering consistently. They're up and running. And so I have visibility, and that's why I have strong confidence. And that's why Wetteny has strong confidence that as we look in to resolve through Q4, we're managing through back orders right now. So we just got to get product out to market, and we're prioritizing the markets at the biggest ones and right now, and we'll get it to everyone by the end of this year, early next year. But when you're back, a few months on a product like Rev+, for example, in markets where that's a huge product, it takes a little while to get them fully back in supply. And that's why we have full confidence. We knew what the issue was. It was capacity there. With Librela and Solensia, it was component parts, and we knew we were competing as well. That's why Wetteny was talking about, we were making trade-offs between products there. We have that in full supply. A lot of these were some were COVID-related. Some of these were capacity related and some were component parts related. It's been challenging for many companies to work through this. But we are as a leadership team managing this very carefully as Wetteny and I said in the first and second quarter calls, constantly working with GMS, we have full visibility into what is happening for each of these products, and that's why we have confidence as to when they will resolve and when we'll get into full supply in key markets. So hopefully, anything else want to add there.\nWetteny Joseph: Look, I just think one of the things that I've really learned in the last 18 months be in this space is, it's not if you recover from a supply constraint, it\u2019s when you recover really matters. So we talk about that already in parasiticides from a season perspective. But that's true across livestock. If you look at gaining supply in time for fall cattle run in the US is important. And so, if you missed that window, you have a greater impact than you thought. So if you were planning to and executing towards the timing of that, and you cover a little bit later, that's where you start to see the impact. And I think that's what's played out here as we exit Q3 and why some of this might appear as a little bit of a surprise to you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on -- we have talked about 75% of the lowered guide was FX and some of the supply constraints. Maybe that smaller portion, the 25% and less, I think, was vet staffing issues. So maybe, can you talk a little bit about what kind of changed what incrementally maybe got worse in the vet staffing issues, how that's trending into the fourth quarter, so we can kind of frame up how that might be a headwind as we go into 2023? And really how -- what kind of confidence you have that, it's not maybe a demand issue as macro conditions worse and it's really just a vet staffing issue? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I mean, look, I'll go back to where I started. If you look at demand at the vet clinic, there's no question that it is fundamentally remaining strong. Current staffing and vet visits is ahead of where it was pre-COVID. So this is not like, Oh My God, everything went down, where are we going. It is a realignment. And I think what -- why are we confident in demand? Well, there are more pets, I mean, why we have a capacity problem is not actually that there are fewer visits, is there are more pets than we had before as we saw the sort of pandemic boom. The pet parents are more millennials. They spend more time on their pets, spend more money on their pets. They're more invested in the preventative care of their pets, which increases demand. So we remain very confident that demand is very strong. It has proved resilient through other challenging macroeconomic times. So what we need to work with vets on is how to better leverage vet techs and other ways to make sure that they can see as many pets as they possibly can. So we remain very confident, this is not a demand issue. It is a capacity issue. We have to create more capacity than they had pre-COVID. There's ways of doing this by helping them improve their productivity across the different spaces. But, I mean, just putting that in numbers, why are we confident there we're fine is, if you look overall right now, the spend per visit is up 9% and clinic revenues are up 5% in the quarter. We did see a 4% decline in vet visits, but that was over a quarter at unprecedented levels, if you look back to last Q3. So the veterinary industry is structurally and fundamentally in good shape. We have to help them create additional capacity for all the new pets we have, but I think demand remains strong.\nWetteny Joseph: I would just say, look, as I said earlier, there are other factors that impact our business. I mean you do see some macro in some select markets. So if I look at Brazil, for example, you see a trade down from beef to poultry and swine. If you look at China, we continue to see lockdowns impact consumption, particularly on the livestock side. But if you look at companion animal performance, even in those markets, despite the significant letdowns in China, you see strong double-digit growth in companion animal. We saw double-digit growth in companion animal even in Brazil, despite the macro. So I do think this speaks to the resiliency of particularly on the companion animal side of the space, even in challenging macro areas. And then, the other thing I'll say with respect to a very strong comp is, if you look at derm, our third quarter last year, derm grew 26% globally. It was north of 20% in the US. And so when you have labor capacity constraints at the vet clinic, being able to perform above that level of growth from a prior year perspective becomes a challenge. So, again, supply is by far the biggest challenge we faced all year and certainly in the third quarter. But the macro continues to be largely from a demand perspective, remaining strong.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick ones here for me. I just want to come back to Trio. With this competitor delay that you're talking about for early next year. I just want to make sure I'm clear. Is there going to be any supply issues as a rate limiter for growth of Trio in 2023 or was this more of a onetime issue in 2022. So, I guess, can you fully take advantage of that delay in competition as we think about the spring season next year? And my second question was on the ongoing supply issues. I know this is -- in the near term, you can't do much about this. Is there an ability to either hold higher inventories or just think about supply differently kind of going forward to ensure that, I guess, these issues don't happen again in the future. Again, I know you can't deal with that in the 3Q, but just as we think about kind of 2023 and beyond, or do you view this, as discussed, a moment in time where there's not much of an ability to manage this? Thanks, so much.\nKristin Peck: Sure. As you look at Trio for 2023, yes, we will be able to leverage the opportunity. Again, the challenge we had this year was getting new capacity online with a third party that took us longer than we expected. That is online and performing well. So we remain confident going into next year that we can leverage that opportunity and certainly have plans in place to do so. And your second question was around -- what was your second question?\nChris Schott: The ability to manage inventory and so on to -- \nKristin Peck: Yes. I mean, look, we're holding -- by the way, we have tried to do that already. If you look -- focusing on resilience and managing inventory better. If you look at our inventory, we've invested a lot in making sure that we have component parts. As we see in our industry, being out of stock has a significant cost for the company. So we're certainly looking at how we can invest in that. But prudently, a lot of the buildup you're seeing right now is in raw materials and things like that to make sure we have on hand what we need to make it, and we're focusing that on our most important products. So you can manage a lot of this through inventory, assuming you have capacity. But if you look at the biggest challenges we faced this year, it was getting on board capacity in key products and getting some of the component parts for things like MAB. And we have figured that out, but -- in the sense of the MAB, and we do have the capacity online. So you do -- you can definitely leverage inventory in certain cases, except when your challenge is capacity or a component part. But I don't know if you want to add to.\nWetteny Joseph: The only thing I would say is, look, the actions we've taken this year will continue to execute against give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunity here with a delay from a competition standpoint. But what we've learned over the last two-plus years is, things happen in this world, whether it's US or Europe and so on. So barring any sort of major events, we do feel confident with our ability to capitalize on this and execute to meet the demand for the product. And we anticipate we'll continue to see demand beyond when a competitor comes into place as well, for the reasons we've already stated.\nOperator: Okay. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Most on supply chain have already been answered. So I'll start with Librela, I think you mentioned it's a blockbuster. It's only outside of the US. I think we typically think of animal health as being or companion animal as being kind of half in the US, half outside the US. Is there something specific about outside the US that's made it resonate so well, or should we still think of this as maybe a $200 million product if it was available in the US? And then a question for Wetteny, you mentioned a lot more, I think, on competition in livestock and I've heard commentary in the past. I mean, I think you said poultry vaccines and Draxxin. Draxxin, of course, has been the ongoing issue. Can you talk about -- is there a way to quantify how much more this quarter or what we're seeing now is competition versus just dynamics across livestock because, of course, dynamics across livestock have been a little bit on the weaker side. And I just want to see how much is transitory and how much of this might be permanent. Thank you for the questions.\nKristin Peck: Sure. So I'll take your first question, and I'll let Wetteny take the second question. As you think about Librela, we are proud that it is a blockbuster in its first full year in launch outside the US. I would note that it hasn't even been launched in every market outside the US. I wouldn't even say it's everywhere there. And if you just take a slight step back here, as you look at the pain category globally in dogs, traditionally, it's been about a $400 million market. We believe with this product, we can double the size of that market. And we've talked about this before, taking a $400 million market to an $800 million market. We believe we can do this, because we think this product's efficacy is really, really strong. And so, if you think about that, we think we can get more dogs to be cared for. It doesn't have some of the safety profile issues of other products. We're seeing that people are staying on it longer. It is already in Europe, the number one pain product, as you think about it. So we are -- we very strongly. If you look at this, 40% customers to Librela are new to the category. This really speaks to the power of this product, that's excitement with us. And we're seeing a 90% reorder rate. So I think you're going to see significant potential for this product, as you look at growing it outside to other markets as Wetteny mentioned earlier, beyond the ones that's already launched in international. And then certainly, when you add to the US. We've seen in some of these really advanced technology products, the US is often bigger than international on most of these products. So we remain very optimistic for the success of this product, just based on so far, it's -- we've talked about this on previous calls, it's done incredibly well and where we've even been upside surprise, is how many months many customers are staying on it. So, we'll continue to see how that evolves over time, but we're very optimistic about this product, not just in international, but as we bring it into the US and as we expand it across international. But Wetteny, do you want to take the second question on livestock?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, the first thing I would say is, there is no structural change with respect to the competitive nature of livestock. It's always been competitive and it remains so. So our commentary here today and what we've been talking about over the last couple of years isn't necessarily different. What is, is that generic competition has had an impact on us over the last couple of years as we anticipated, as we said. So Jackson, if you look at Jackson prior to LOE, we are roughly in the mid-$300 million, let's call it, $350 million in revenue. That by far, the largest sort of individual product within livestock. And so, certainly, as we anticipated, about a 20% impact in the first year, another 20% in the second year. The first year was a little bit better than that. It was south of 20%, but the second year is above that. And so, still in the neighborhood, maybe a little bit worse than what we thought initially, with respect to Jackson, but there's no other large product like that. I would say, in the portfolio, though Zoamix also has seen some competition, but it was nowhere near the size of a Jackson. So short story is, no change in terms of what we're seeing in terms of the competitiveness of livestock, is just a little bit more intensification in terms of products that have become generic if they are sizable.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Steve Scala with Cowen. Please, go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Many thanks. First, just to clarify, in the prepared remarks, it was stated that supply challenges were more pronounced in Q3 and that there is increased uncertainty. Can you clarify why supply challenges peaked in Q3 and why there is now more uncertainty as opposed to what was seen in Q2 or apparently what is anticipated in Q4? And then secondly, China lockdowns were mentioned. Can you quantify the impact? And then lastly, what is the capacity of Lincoln to manufacture the pain monoclonal antibodies? I thought at one point, some small-scale manufacturing was done there. Is that a possibility to be expanded? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: So I'll start and see if Kristin wants to add anything. With respect to the supply challenges, I think we've described in a fair amount of detail what we saw happen and why the impact was more noticeable in the third quarter, though we also made significant progress as we exited the quarter. So the impact that we're seeing in the third quarter, if we double-click on parasiticides, for example, particularly with Trio, I mean, from Q1, we have -- we've had outages on Trio across certain strengths, et cetera. And we continue to run with constraints throughout the year. But in particular, in Q2 and Q3, those outages really left more space across vet clinics for competitors to fill those shelves. And so, as we got into Q3, again, continuing to be in the parasiticide season, we saw switchovers with respect to new patients coming off of collars and topicals, for example, going into orals, rather than coming into our product going into some of our competitors, because our competitors filled shelves when we had gaps. So that's why we saw a bigger impact in that in terms of what we saw, particularly for Trio. Revolution\u2019s been an issue, quite frankly, throughout the year and remains so, even as we've gotten into Q4 here, which is why we say we continue to see uncertainty in certain products here. Vaccines, I would say, a relatively commonplace across the industry in terms of having supply issues. And again, we've seen a little bit more of those this year. And again, particularly in Q3, given the cattle run in the US in the fall, et cetera. So we saw some of that -- the impact of those outages more pronounced in the quarter. So hopefully, that gives you plenty, if there's a follow-up, I'm sure you can take it up with Steve offline as well. But that's the detail that we've shared. With respect to capacity for MABS, these are long lead time areas, right? If you take the time to manufacture, it's long lead time, the time to add capacity in monoclonal antibodies is also relatively long. So we've been working on those for some time, which is why, as we've gone through this year, we -- and we express confidence into next year being able to not only capitalize on demand that we see across Europe, but we'll be able to launch in other products outside of Europe across our international segment with confidence, because we have been able to expand in various areas. I won't go into a specific site in terms of what their capacity is. But suffice it to say, our monoclonal antibodies manufacturing is more than just one location in terms of where we do that. And you've seen us take an uptick as well in terms of CapEx going from last year to this year, we've talked about that all year. And you continue to see an uptick in CapEx as we go into the next year or two as well, because we continue to make investments in capacity and monoclonal antibodies are an important platform for us, not only with respect to derm with Cytopoint with the pain franchise, but other products that we're working on in our pipeline, we require those. So we'll continue to make investments with respect to MAB on capacity.\nKristin Peck: A few follow-ups there. I mean, for starters, the comment on uncertainty had to do with the macroeconomic environment. The question is, we're still seeing very strong consumer demand, but there's still a belief that we'll have potentially a recession in Q1, Q2, Q3. It was not about increased uncertainty, to be clear, in supply. It was uncertainty as to the macroeconomic environment and what we'll be looking at into 2023 or even in Q4. So let me be clear, the uncertainty comment that was not related to supply. The only -- the comment I'll make is with regards to the China question. I mean, look, in Q3, China grew 35% even with these lockdowns, again, underlying what we've been saying, the demand for our products remains very strong. What's important there is, if you look like four or five years ago, it was a majority livestock business. It became about 50-50 last year between livestock and companion animal. And if you look at it right now, the lockdowns are clearly impacting livestock, but companion animal, and given its close to 50-50, grew almost double what you see as China's growth that. So even with the lockdowns, we really see China remaining a strong market for us and growing quite well. So I think we can weather those lockdowns. I mean, look, if we -- the lockdown staff, which does not appear based on the news in the last 24 hours, to be something that's going to be happening in the near term, you might see livestock recover a little faster than what it is. But again, even in this environment, even with lockdowns, you saw 35% growth in Q3 in China. So I would just underscore that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please, go ahead.\nMichael Parolari: Hi, guys. This is actually Michael Parolari on for Elliot. Thanks for taking my questions. So first one from me, you guys might have touched on this earlier, so apologies if I missed that commentary, but any early commentary on how we should be thinking about currency impacts on top line and margin trends into 2023? And then second question is, growth contribution from price this quarter, I believe, you said, was 1% compared to 3% over the past two quarters. Most of the industry seems to be moving in the other direction, given the current macro environment. So just wondering, if you guys could touch on perhaps what negatively impacted that growth contribution in the period and how to be thinking about that moving forward? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, I'll start. And -- and see, what Kristin will add. First of all, with respect to currency, if you look at this year, top line impact from FX, given the strength of the US dollar is about 4%. So on the year, 4% which is roughly $39 million headwind versus prior year rates. If you look at the impact all the way down to the bottom line, it's about 8%. And so, from an EPS standpoint, that's about $0.36 of headwind. It's about $0.07 worse than our prior guidance, given the continued strength of the US dollar. So that's where we are. We're not going to forecast what FX might do. But our guidance is based on where rates were at the end of October here. And we'll continue to update, but we'll focus on commentary around operational growth given, given FX impact, but that's the impact that we're seeing this year. But if I didn't go into price here, on a year-to-date basis, if you look at our companion animal product sales and revenues, we've taken about 5% price on a year-to-date basis. And so, what is offsetting that largely is what we've been talking about here today, which is, the generic competition, particularly on Jackson, that's offsetting that growth where you see a net of 1% in the quarter. But on a year-to-date basis, our price is about 2%. If you include the impact of generic competition and higher than that without -- but companion animal is where we have innovative products, we continue to see strong demand, and we're taking price to the tune of about 5%. And if you look at our margins, roughly 90 basis points down year-over-year, FX is by far the biggest contributor to that. So if you take FX out, you've got about 20 basis points. So essentially, our price is offsetting increases in manufacturing costs, et cetera, being price and mix and so on is what we're seeing. So that's where the offset is. We're right about where you might see across elsewhere in the industry, our vet practices, given the strong demand we continue to see are actually taking price at or above what we're taking in that 5% on companion animal as well.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is actually Makayla on for Balaji. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Trio, just wondering what the penetration has been for corporate accounts and just how much room is left for further expansion? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So we've been very pleased with the penetration across large corporate accounts. We're about 90%, but we still see more room, even within those large corporate accounts to increase utilization of Trio. And we continue to work on those, and that's part of where our expanded field force in the US is focused in addition to, obviously, with the launches of other products, et cetera, and across derm to continue to penetrate and so on. So we've been very pleased with the overall penetration across large corporates. We continue to work on smaller and mid-sized accounts as well. And we see more room within those penetrated clinics to get better utilization on Trio. I don't know if you would add anything to that, Kristin.\nKristin Peck: No.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Kristin Peck for any closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Great. Look, thanks, everybody, for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, we continue to see strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our products for pet care and the fundamental drivers of animal health, as I've said throughout this call, remained fundamentally and structurally very strong. We continue to invest in talent and innovation, certainly in manufacturing expansions, as we've talked to you today that can support this future growth, while adapting and optimizing our business for the increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment that we all operate in. We look forward to keeping you updated on future calls. Thanks so much for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2022. While the world faces a dynamic external environment and uncertainty in the global economy, our business has been tested and continues to perform well, based on our diverse durable portfolio and global footprint. In the third quarter, we delivered solid results with 5% operational revenue growth, reflecting steady performance across our innovation-driven companion animal portfolio, especially in our international markets. Our international business grew 8% operationally and the US grew 2% in the quarter. As we've been saying for some time, supply challenges throughout the year remain a headwind to meeting global demand, and those impacts were more pronounced in the third quarter. Supply has been improving in certain product categories, such as parasiticides, and we continue prioritizing supply for key products and markets. However, we do expect constraints in some categories to continue. Overall, positive pet care trends in terms of increasing spend and pet owner demographics continue to underpin the strength of our business. With 10% operational growth in companion animal products in the third quarter, we continue to see strong demand globally for Simparica Trio and other parasiticides, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, small animal vaccine and monoclonal antibodies, Librela and Solensia. In the US, supply constraints for companion animal products tempered some of our expected growth in the quarter, and we also experienced an impact related to workforce challenges in veterinary clinics. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID rates, as clinics struggle with capacity issues. That being said, average revenues per visit continue to rise in the US as pet owners place a premium on the care of their pets, a positive long-term trend. This commitment to pet well-being is also demonstrated in the success of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain, Librela and Solensia. They are performing exceptionally well in the EU and Solensia is on track after being launched in the US at the end of the third quarter. We are investing in building a feline market for pain treatment and undertreated condition for cats. Outside of the US, companion animal products showed strong growth of 17% operationally. In some of our largest markets like China and Australia, we're seeing our innovative pet care products contributing more and more to growth in these traditionally live stock-driven markets. Meanwhile, our global livestock business performed largely as expected in the third quarter, with a decline of 3% operationally. We continue to face generic competition for livestock products, especially in cattle and poultry, and we face supply constraints in products such as vaccines. However, we are seeing solid pockets of growth, especially in aquaculture and poultry products and certain markets outside the US. As we stabilize from the generic competition, and review more consistent supply, we will improve our livestock performance. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the innovation-driven strength of our business especially in areas such as parasiticides, key dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. I am optimistic about the fundamental growth drivers and essential nature of the animal health industry to weather challenging times. However, we are revising our full year guidance to affect lower-than-expected sales in the second half of the year due to supply constraints, veterinary workforce challenges and recent changes to foreign exchange rates. We believe it is prudent to take a more cautious view, given the increasing uncertainty around supply, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions that have become less predictable. As we look ahead, to our tenth anniversary as an independent company next year and I reflect on all that we've achieved in the last decade, I feel very positive about where we are and the capabilities we have to overcome any challenges we face. Historically, we've always been able to adapt our business to meet evolving customer needs, drive growth faster than the market and achieve our purpose in nurturing the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. The human animal bond and people's connection to pets and farm animals is powerful. It's a bond we support with a diverse portfolio that remains the strength of our business, and we see strong global demand for innovative products, especially in companion animal parasiticides, dermatology, vaccines, diagnostics and monoclonal antibodies for pain. Positive pet owner demographics and their willingness to spend on the care of their animals remain long-term sustainable drivers of growth, despite some of the workforce challenges in clinics and livestock continues to be an important part of our business, an area where we drive significant value for our customers and shareholders. To sustain our growth, innovation remains our lifeblood, and we continue investing in the industry's leading R&D engine at Zoetis. Our monoclonal antibody portfolio for OA pain is a game changer. It has been performing exceptionally well as a pet treatment and growth driver in an increasing number of markets, and Librela is expected to be a blockbuster for Zoetis in 2022. In terms of the US approval for Librela, we have confirmed dates for the FDA site inspections outside the US, but their timing makes it unlikely to have an approval this year. Given our ongoing conversations with the FDA, we are confident in receiving approval in the first half of 2023 with a launch planned for late in the year. In closing, our business continues to perform well in a dynamic market and we are well positioned to advance our strategic growth opportunities in parasiticides, dermatology, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. Even as we face challenging supply constraints, generic competition and macroeconomic uncertainty, I remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues, as we finish 2022 and we go into 2023. Given the importance of the companionship and nutrition provided by pets and farm minimals and the power of the human animal bond, the animal health industry has consistently grown in the mid-single digits, even in down markets. And as the leader in animal health, we have the pipeline, market leadership positions, global scale and financial strength to continue outpacing the market. Throughout the last 10 years in various market conditions, we have grown the top line an average of about 8%. And even in the last recession, when our business was more livestock than companion animal, we still grew. As we look toward the end of the year and into 2023, I expect us to continue setting the bar on innovation, cultivating a high-performing culture and delivering superior customer experiences. All of this will have us growing significantly above the market and building enduring value for shareholders in this dynamic market. Thank you. Now let me hand things over to Wetteny. Sure. Thanks, Aaron. I'll start and I'll let Wetteny build on this one. I mean, I think, the first thing to start with is fundamentally and structurally the veterinary business and importantly, demand for our products remains stronger than it was before COVID. I think we've got still a very healthy business. If you look at sort of the headwinds as we looked at the second half of this year, by far, supply was the biggest, and I'll let Wetteny comment on sort of sizing them I would say that was the significant driver for us in Q3. And as we look into Q4, I mean, certainly, we can talk about vet clinic visits as well. But I think for us, we really believe that the supply issues that we were facing were really the primary driver for us. And as we look into 2023, I think the really good news around that is -- as we look at the ones we faced this year, as we talked about supply from the beginning of the year, we had MABS issues. We worked through that. We're now in full supply on our MABS in all the markets that we've launched in. So I think that one is one we've addressed. We did have paras challenges in Q2, Q3, honestly, our supply came in too late in Q3. And I think if you look at Simparica Trio in particular, our competitors took advantage of the top shelves. And so it's taken us a little longer to get back on shelf than we had hoped. But again, I think the paras problem will work itself out as you look into Q4. We have challenges as well in Rev. for Rev and Simparica, Q3 is a really important quarter for us. And so I think you saw that. I think, again, the really good news is demand remains strong for these products, and we've addressed most of those supply issues. There'll be some small ongoing ones, as you know, in our industry, Aaron, you followed us a long time. We always have challenges around vaccines. When you supply as many products as we do across as many species globally, there's always some level of it, and some of those will continue into next year. But we're really confident that the biggest challenges we were anticipating this year around MAB have been addressed. As you look at paras, both Trio and Rev, we'll work through that by the end of this year. We have really clear plans in place. I mean, obviously, there'll be some ongoing one in vaccines, but that's more usual, of course, but Wetteny, do you want to sort of get some for second and third questions? Sure. I'll start and I'll let Wetteny build on this one. As you think about competitors, yes, I am very confident that we will get our shelf space back, and there's -- this is -- I very much see this as temporary. We're not worried as Wetteny said, this product is really well received by our customers and by pet owners. It's growing 65% on the year. So I am very confident we will get that back. So I see that absolutely as temporary. So I think the other important thing here as we look at Simparica Trio, in particular, is that, when it comes to competition, the latest update we have is we are no longer expecting competition early in 2023 based on what we're hearing. As always, this is hard as a private company, and no one gives us much information on some of the private companies here and that a lot of them are not public, but our basic intelligence at this point is, we don't see something launching against us as well early in the year, and we'll clearly leverage that opportunity to gain share as well. So I think that is also incremental news as we think about Trio. And when it comes to Librela, I mean, obviously, we were hoping for an approval this year, depending on when we get it next year, we just have to -- everything moves based on what that is. So we're still obviously hoping for a launch as we expected. But without knowing the exact timing of the approval into next year, it just moves proportionately, as you probably know. So I think that's just the only incremental news there. We're confident, well, no matter what, we'll get a launch next year. But the timing of it is just we'll have to update it once we get the final approval on that. I don't know, Wetteny, did I miss anything there? Sure. Louise, in your first question with regards to competition, I think the good news is we're not expecting competition early in the year anymore on Trio. But regardless of when competition arises, I do think we'll continue to grow through this. If you look at this category, even when [indiscernible] were introduced and you saw one then two then three, this category grew, we launched a triple combination, and we grew incredibly well. I think there was plenty of space here. Wetteny mentioned earlier, there's still movement from topicals and collars and this is a really innovative category. So I do believe you'll continue to see growth. As you look at dermatology, I would say the same thing. I think a competitor can help us continue to grow this market. There are still 6 million untreated dogs. The usage of this product in international is still significantly below that of the US when you have the same number of dogs with the conditions. So we continue to believe there is growth across these. Obviously, growth may decelerate in derm with a competitor, but I still think these are going to be growing markets. I think the innovation. And don't forget, we continue to look at life cycle enhancements for all of these products. We are not stopping with what we have. So I think there's a lot of visibility into a competitor might come, but not necessarily some of the innovations in these key product categories that we'll continue to do. With regards to innovation and livestock, Wetteny, do you want to take that one with regards to growth rates? And sure, I'll take your second question around visibility into supply resolution. When we started the year, like many companies across many different sectors, we knew supply challenges would be there waiting on things as you look at ones where -- to your point, were we a little surprised by what happened with specifically Trio and Rev. I mean the honest answer is yes, we thought they would resolve faster. It's not that we weren't aware this was a capacity issue. We needed to build capacity and specifically some of this at a third party. And honestly, getting that third party on took us a little longer than we expected. We set a really an OpEx team over there to try to work on it and the timing of the resolution took us longer than we expected on that one. Why am I have visibility to why I say it's better, because we're having a weekly call, I'm looking at their output on a weekly basis for both Revolution and Trio, and they're doing really well. I think they're delivering consistently. They're up and running. And so I have visibility, and that's why I have strong confidence. And that's why Wetteny has strong confidence that as we look in to resolve through Q4, we're managing through back orders right now. So we just got to get product out to market, and we're prioritizing the markets at the biggest ones and right now, and we'll get it to everyone by the end of this year, early next year. But when you're back, a few months on a product like Rev+, for example, in markets where that's a huge product, it takes a little while to get them fully back in supply. And that's why we have full confidence. We knew what the issue was. It was capacity there. With Librela and Solensia, it was component parts, and we knew we were competing as well. That's why Wetteny was talking about, we were making trade-offs between products there. We have that in full supply. A lot of these were some were COVID-related. Some of these were capacity related and some were component parts related. It's been challenging for many companies to work through this. But we are as a leadership team managing this very carefully as Wetteny and I said in the first and second quarter calls, constantly working with GMS, we have full visibility into what is happening for each of these products, and that's why we have confidence as to when they will resolve and when we'll get into full supply in key markets. So hopefully, anything else want to add there. Sure. I mean, look, I'll go back to where I started. If you look at demand at the vet clinic, there's no question that it is fundamentally remaining strong. Current staffing and vet visits is ahead of where it was pre-COVID. So this is not like, Oh My God, everything went down, where are we going. It is a realignment. And I think what -- why are we confident in demand? Well, there are more pets, I mean, why we have a capacity problem is not actually that there are fewer visits, is there are more pets than we had before as we saw the sort of pandemic boom. The pet parents are more millennials. They spend more time on their pets, spend more money on their pets. They're more invested in the preventative care of their pets, which increases demand. So we remain very confident that demand is very strong. It has proved resilient through other challenging macroeconomic times. So what we need to work with vets on is how to better leverage vet techs and other ways to make sure that they can see as many pets as they possibly can. So we remain very confident, this is not a demand issue. It is a capacity issue. We have to create more capacity than they had pre-COVID. There's ways of doing this by helping them improve their productivity across the different spaces. But, I mean, just putting that in numbers, why are we confident there we're fine is, if you look overall right now, the spend per visit is up 9% and clinic revenues are up 5% in the quarter. We did see a 4% decline in vet visits, but that was over a quarter at unprecedented levels, if you look back to last Q3. So the veterinary industry is structurally and fundamentally in good shape. We have to help them create additional capacity for all the new pets we have, but I think demand remains strong. Sure. As you look at Trio for 2023, yes, we will be able to leverage the opportunity. Again, the challenge we had this year was getting new capacity online with a third party that took us longer than we expected. That is online and performing well. So we remain confident going into next year that we can leverage that opportunity and certainly have plans in place to do so. And your second question was around -- what was your second question? Yes. I mean, look, we're holding -- by the way, we have tried to do that already. If you look -- focusing on resilience and managing inventory better. If you look at our inventory, we've invested a lot in making sure that we have component parts. As we see in our industry, being out of stock has a significant cost for the company. So we're certainly looking at how we can invest in that. But prudently, a lot of the buildup you're seeing right now is in raw materials and things like that to make sure we have on hand what we need to make it, and we're focusing that on our most important products. So you can manage a lot of this through inventory, assuming you have capacity. But if you look at the biggest challenges we faced this year, it was getting on board capacity in key products and getting some of the component parts for things like MAB. And we have figured that out, but -- in the sense of the MAB, and we do have the capacity online. So you do -- you can definitely leverage inventory in certain cases, except when your challenge is capacity or a component part. But I don't know if you want to add to. Sure. So I'll take your first question, and I'll let Wetteny take the second question. As you think about Librela, we are proud that it is a blockbuster in its first full year in launch outside the US. I would note that it hasn't even been launched in every market outside the US. I wouldn't even say it's everywhere there. And if you just take a slight step back here, as you look at the pain category globally in dogs, traditionally, it's been about a $400 million market. We believe with this product, we can double the size of that market. And we've talked about this before, taking a $400 million market to an $800 million market. We believe we can do this, because we think this product's efficacy is really, really strong. And so, if you think about that, we think we can get more dogs to be cared for. It doesn't have some of the safety profile issues of other products. We're seeing that people are staying on it longer. It is already in Europe, the number one pain product, as you think about it. So we are -- we very strongly. If you look at this, 40% customers to Librela are new to the category. This really speaks to the power of this product, that's excitement with us. And we're seeing a 90% reorder rate. So I think you're going to see significant potential for this product, as you look at growing it outside to other markets as Wetteny mentioned earlier, beyond the ones that's already launched in international. And then certainly, when you add to the US. We've seen in some of these really advanced technology products, the US is often bigger than international on most of these products. So we remain very optimistic for the success of this product, just based on so far, it's -- we've talked about this on previous calls, it's done incredibly well and where we've even been upside surprise, is how many months many customers are staying on it. So, we'll continue to see how that evolves over time, but we're very optimistic about this product, not just in international, but as we bring it into the US and as we expand it across international. But Wetteny, do you want to take the second question on livestock? A few follow-ups there. I mean, for starters, the comment on uncertainty had to do with the macroeconomic environment. The question is, we're still seeing very strong consumer demand, but there's still a belief that we'll have potentially a recession in Q1, Q2, Q3. It was not about increased uncertainty, to be clear, in supply. It was uncertainty as to the macroeconomic environment and what we'll be looking at into 2023 or even in Q4. So let me be clear, the uncertainty comment that was not related to supply. The only -- the comment I'll make is with regards to the China question. I mean, look, in Q3, China grew 35% even with these lockdowns, again, underlying what we've been saying, the demand for our products remains very strong. What's important there is, if you look like four or five years ago, it was a majority livestock business. It became about 50-50 last year between livestock and companion animal. And if you look at it right now, the lockdowns are clearly impacting livestock, but companion animal, and given its close to 50-50, grew almost double what you see as China's growth that. So even with the lockdowns, we really see China remaining a strong market for us and growing quite well. So I think we can weather those lockdowns. I mean, look, if we -- the lockdown staff, which does not appear based on the news in the last 24 hours, to be something that's going to be happening in the near term, you might see livestock recover a little faster than what it is. But again, even in this environment, even with lockdowns, you saw 35% growth in Q3 in China. So I would just underscore that. No. Great. Look, thanks, everybody, for your questions today and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, we continue to see strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our products for pet care and the fundamental drivers of animal health, as I've said throughout this call, remained fundamentally and structurally very strong. We continue to invest in talent and innovation, certainly in manufacturing expansions, as we've talked to you today that can support this future growth, while adapting and optimizing our business for the increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment that we all operate in. We look forward to keeping you updated on future calls. Thanks so much for joining us today."

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a solid quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises, driven by our companion animal performance, especially in international. Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 1% on a reported basis and 5% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $566 million declined 5% on a reported basis and grew 2% on an operational basis. Of the 5% operational revenue growth, 4% is from volume and 1% from price. Volume growth consisted of 4% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela an Solensia and 1% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 1%. The decline was largely the result of supply challenges. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 10% operationally, with livestock declining 3% on an operational basis in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $172 million, representing operational growth of 43% versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flee, tick and heartworm globally and see significant room for growth with brands like Simparica Trio, Simparica, ProHeart and Revolution Plus. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had solid global growth, especially internationally, with $343 million of revenue, representing 11% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products grew 26% operationally. Year-to-date revenue is $966 million, representing 18% operational growth. Sales of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in International continue to exceed expectations, posting $37 million of sales in the quarter. Switching to Diagnostics. Our global Companion Animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $78 million in revenue in Q3, declining 9% operationally. Despite declining revenues, we saw solid new instrument placements in the quarter. The decline in our US diagnostics portfolio was partially offset by growth internationally in the quarter. In the US, our diagnostics results were also impacted by the vet clinic workforce challenges, and we continue to experience a slowdown in sales as we transition to our new go-to-market model and build out a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run. We expect the effectiveness of our new diagnosis field force to improve gradually into 2023. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Meanwhile, sales of lifestyle products declined by 3% operationally in the quarter. Our portfolio continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to Draxxin in cattle as well as Zoamix in poultry and supply challenges for certain products. Our fish portfolio grew 19% operationally in the quarter and along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 2%, with companion animal sales growing 6% and livestock sales declining by 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. The effects of our ongoing supply challenges were more pronounced in the third quarter, tempering growth in our parasiticides. In US companion animal, we are also seeing vet clinic workforce challenges limiting appointment availability as visits declined 4% in the quarter. Despite lower visits, practice revenue is growing approximately 5% and as spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing more than 9%. The decline in clinic visits is stabilizing at pre-COVID levels, as the impact of higher pet ownership growth rates due to COVID normalize and vet practices deal with workforce challenges. However, underlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country, even as people return to work. While vet clinic workforce challenges do exist, we believe vet clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better pet ownership demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Even with the robust comparative year, we continue to see volume growth in our companion animal products, driven by our innovative products, such as Trio and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $157 million in the US, growing 43%. Despite the impact of supply constraints and the vet clinic workforce challenges, we continue to take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio. Key dermatology products sales in the US were $231 million for the quarter, growing 6% with Apoquel and Cytopoint each contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our US derm portfolio has grown 12%. Growth is tempered by prior year cover related spice in derm visits that drive visit growth of 25% in Q3, 2021, and help accelerate market expansion. This growth was also impacted by the ongoing pet clinic workforce challenges. We expect continued expansion of the market for the foreseeable future. US livestock declined 7% in the quarter as expected, with sales of cattle products impacted by generic competition for Jackson. Meanwhile, our US poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. US swine product sales declined 3% in the quarter, driven primarily by increased competition for vaccines. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue declined 2% on a reported basis and grew 8% operationally in the quarter. International Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue was flat operationally. Increased sales of comparing animal products resulted from growth of monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products, and Simparica Trio. We remain excited with the long-term prospects of these innovative brands and expect future direct-to-consumer advertising to help drive additional growth. Sales of companion animal vaccines also contributed to growth in the quarter. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $31 million and Solensia delivering $6 million in third quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year, a new blockbuster for Zoetis. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the number one pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. We saw volume growth in our international companion animal portfolio in the third quarter and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Meanwhile, international livestock was flat operationally in the quarter. Our fish portfolio grew 19% operationally and experienced increased demand for vaccines in key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of sheep products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. Growth was offset by swine sales, which declined due to supply constraints across international and lower sales across Europe due to reduced exports to China and higher input costs for producers. Sales in Brazil also declined as we are seeing supply challenges on cattle products. Additionally, inflationary impacts on consumer spending are driving consumption away from beef to lower-cost animal proteins such as pork and chicken and reducing reducer profitability. Lastly, the Jurox acquisition, which is based in Australia, was completed on September 30 and is not reflected in our Q3 results. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 90 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Operationally, gross margin slightly declined, driven by higher manufacturing, freight and other costs, which were largely offset by favorable mix and price. Adjusted operating expenses increased 3% operationally, with SG&A growth of 3% operationally, driven by T&E costs beginning to return to pre-COVID levels as well as freight and logistics. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs and higher operating costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, an increase of 420 basis points due to unfavorable changes to the jurisdictional mix of earnings, including decreased favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income in the prior year period. And finally, adjusted net income grew 2% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $154 million. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately $375 million of Zoetis shares and returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we have repurchased almost $1.2 billion of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are lowering our growth to 7% to 8%, previously 9.5% to 10.5%. We are also lowering our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 9% to 11%, previously 11% to 13%. This change in guidance is reflective of our Q3 results, continued impact from supply challenges and the ongoing veterinary workforce challenges. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late October and reflect the continued strengthening of the US dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to lowering of our guidance and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.0 billion and $8.075 billion. We lowered our operating expense guidance for the full year, reflecting lower expenses in both Q3 and Q4, which reflects our ability to manage costs. Additionally, it is worth noting that our expected Q4 expense decline is also impacted by an easier comp due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter last year. Additionally, our guidance for adjusted interest expense and OID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.27 billion to $2.31 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.83 to $4.90 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.51 to $4.59. While lower, our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term. Our success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation and our infrastructure to develop and expand market globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on key growth opportunities for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Yeah, sure. Erin, as we've been saying throughout this year, supply certainly remains a headwind to meeting global demand. And as Kristin mentioned, the timing of recovery on some of these is very important. So as we went throughout the year and face supply constraints, particularly in Trio, despite the fact that Trio has performed really well for us, growing 65% on a year-to-date basis. The reality is, we had outages throughout the peak parasiticide season for Trio to Q2 and Q3, though we recovered late in Q3, the impact was such that we allowed competitors to be more aggressive about placing products on shelves, which we saw that impact as we exited Q3. But going forward, we do anticipate continuing to see some impact for Revolution, Revolution Plus, where we are selectively looking at key markets to deliver those products against others. So that is something that we're carrying into the fourth quarter, and we have reflected in the guidance that we have issued today. So while our business faces other impacts outside of supply, whether it's workforce or macro in certain markets. By far, the supply constraints are the biggest impact here, looking at how we've seen the year sort of transition versus what we saw earlier. And so, if you look at the guidance change here of about $200 million reduction in guidance, I would say, FX and supply account for more than 75% of that, with supply being by far the largest majority of that. I'll just add a couple of points on Trio. Look, if you look at combination, flee, tick, heartworm, it's still a relatively new standard of care. And what you continue to see is in this very important part of the market, which is north of $5 billion globally. This expansion going from topicals and orals -- topicals and collars into orals and then now with triple combinations, we'll continue to expand that into the market and grow the market as well. So even with competition, we expect to continue to grow. So this dynamic that we described that occurred as we exited Q3 -- between Q2 and Q3, we see that as a temporary effect, and we'll continue to drive our share here. And particularly, since we are not anticipating a delay in terms of competition, though it's hard to say exactly when it will come. It could come in 2023, but we don't expect it early in the year. With respect to Librela, what I would say is, we continue to be extremely pleased and the product continues to perform better than our expectations across Europe. And though we've had capacity constraints that didn't allow us to be able to take full advantage of demand this year and we've had to actually make trade-offs in terms of delaying launches in other markets. As we exit the year, we anticipate next year being able to launch the product in additional markets outside the US and outside of Europe. And the product, again, continues to perform really well for us. So we're very pleased with that. And so this sort of delay in terms of when the actual approval will happen in the US, given the dynamics we're seeing in terms of the expansion of 40% of the dogs that have been put on the product and new to the market. The less of time duration of use of the product, et cetera, all bode well for sort of continued growth in this area and expansion of the pain market beyond the timing of the launch, et cetera. Yes. So, look, what I would say is, supply issue is not unique to us, given the wide variety of products and species. It's relatively commonplace in this industry, as I've learned coming in about a year-and-a-half ago. I think the level that we're seeing now is certainly elevated over the last couple of years. And in particular, we saw more of an impact here in Q3, given the timing of our recovery on some of these, right? So I do think we expect to see some continued impact into Q4, but we reflected those in the guidance that we just issued today. I mentioned Revolution, for example, being one of them and quite frankly, throughout the years in the MABS where we are confident in our ability to fulfill demand next year, not only in Europe but other markets outside of Europe. We've made trade-offs in MABS even between, for example, Cytopoint and Librela, right? So I do think those impacts have had their effects on this year. But as we go into next year, we're confident in those. I think vaccines is an area that you typically see certain supply constraints in and challenges, and I think we'll continue to see those into 2024 and as we exit the year, we'll continue to make progress on Revolution, but it is certainly having an impact on the fourth quarter as well is what I would say. Of course, we'll have a lot more color to provide on the next call with respect to 2023, but we feel confident on the biggest products that have the greatest impacts. If you look at Trio from a parasiticide perspective, confidence in terms of supply going into next year. And for our MABS, particularly Librela launches, et cetera, and for Cytopoint for next year, we feel very confident about that as well. So those are big movers for us going into 2023. Yes, sure. Look, I think if you look at livestock, as we said, this is a segment that has grown in the sort of 3% to 4% range historically. And given the impact that we're seeing from generic competition for Draxxin, Zoamix, et cetera, we've been performing below that. But as we sit here, if we, for example, were to pro forma out the Draxxin impact, you would see growth in our livestock business, even in the quarter that we delivered negative 3 on Q3, which is similar to last quarter. And so, I think, as we look to exit this year, I think livestock will be slightly below the performance you saw in Q3, given the intensification of some of the generic competition. But beyond that, as we look beyond out exiting 2023 into 2024, et cetera, we'll have to take a look at what the macro is. I think if you look at cattle in key markets across Brazil, and elsewhere in the US, we'll have to really continue to look at what the macro is. But in terms of innovation, we continue to make innovation that, quite frankly, you're not seeing the impact of them in the current year because of the impact of generic competition. So if you look at inhibition in terms of poultry with vector vaccines that we're starting to launch in the US. If you look at some of our swine vaccines that we're launching elsewhere, we've had some supply constraints in those as well. So you're not seeing the full effect of those. But beyond this year and beyond the generic competition is that sort of supply pull, you start to see growth coming out of our livestock business. I just want to make one more point going back to derm. We don't -- last earnings, we said we don't see competition for derm in the first half of next year. Now, three months later, there's still no new news, right? And so, I think, as you know, in the space, it's not that we have specific data on what folks have. And so, it's about a six-month time frame that we look ahead. And three months later, we still don't see anything. So it's not to say that we expect competition next year is just we don't have any data that says there will be any in the first half. So I just want to make that clarifying point as you asked the question around competition next year. Yes. So I'll take the first part of the question in terms of how we see margins and investments, et cetera. We've made a number of investments across the business, whether you look at what we're doing in R&D, what we've done with respect to our field force, and we'll continue to do across the diagnostics in our pet care field force, for example, in the US, we're making investments across our supply chain and manufacturing, obviously, given the demand we're seeing across our products and anticipated launches of other products out into the future. So we'll continue to make those investments, but we do have the ability to manage discretionary spend and you see that play out in the third quarter, where OpEx was below top line growth. And in fact, other than the tax rate difference to last year, if you look at our earnings before taxes, those grew at 8% on a 5% top line growth. So you see that leverage playing out in the P&L. And we have the ability to continue to do that. And I think we'll continue to use price to drive margins. The mix is favorable to us, given companion animal continues to grow faster than livestock. So companion animal grew 10% in the quarter where livestock declined 3%. So that mix is favorable to us, although, we see some offset with respect to inflation and so on, but you continue to see those drivers, and we can anticipate those going into next year. So we'll continue to make investments in select areas, again, prioritizing R&D prioritizing manufacturing and supply chain, for example, but we'll manage discretionary spend elsewhere to still deliver a leveraged P&L, which is what we've said. Now there may be quarters, where that doesn't play out exactly. But I think if you look at a year, you will see us continue to do that. And that margin between top line growth and bottom line growth may be less than what the business naturally can do, but that's because we're making investments where we see the need, but we will still manage to deliver annually a leveraged P&L is our target. Look, I just think one of the things that I've really learned in the last 18 months be in this space is, it's not if you recover from a supply constraint, it's when you recover really matters. So we talk about that already in parasiticides from a season perspective. But that's true across livestock. If you look at gaining supply in time for fall cattle run in the US is important. And so, if you missed that window, you have a greater impact than you thought. So if you were planning to and executing towards the timing of that, and you cover a little bit later, that's where you start to see the impact. And I think that's what's played out here as we exit Q3 and why some of this might appear as a little bit of a surprise to you. I would just say, look, as I said earlier, there are other factors that impact our business. I mean you do see some macro in some select markets. So if I look at Brazil, for example, you see a trade down from beef to poultry and swine. If you look at China, we continue to see lockdowns impact consumption, particularly on the livestock side. But if you look at companion animal performance, even in those markets, despite the significant letdowns in China, you see strong double-digit growth in companion animal. We saw double-digit growth in companion animal even in Brazil, despite the macro. So I do think this speaks to the resiliency of particularly on the companion animal side of the space, even in challenging macro areas. And then, the other thing I'll say with respect to a very strong comp is, if you look at derm, our third quarter last year, derm grew 26% globally. It was north of 20% in the US. And so when you have labor capacity constraints at the vet clinic, being able to perform above that level of growth from a prior year perspective becomes a challenge. So, again, supply is by far the biggest challenge we faced all year and certainly in the third quarter. But the macro continues to be largely from a demand perspective, remaining strong. The only thing I would say is, look, the actions we've taken this year will continue to execute against give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the opportunity here with a delay from a competition standpoint. But what we've learned over the last two-plus years is, things happen in this world, whether it's US or Europe and so on. So barring any sort of major events, we do feel confident with our ability to capitalize on this and execute to meet the demand for the product. And we anticipate we'll continue to see demand beyond when a competitor comes into place as well, for the reasons we've already stated. Yes, sure. Look, the first thing I would say is, there is no structural change with respect to the competitive nature of livestock. It's always been competitive and it remains so. So our commentary here today and what we've been talking about over the last couple of years isn't necessarily different. What is, is that generic competition has had an impact on us over the last couple of years as we anticipated, as we said. So Jackson, if you look at Jackson prior to LOE, we are roughly in the mid-$300 million, let's call it, $350 million in revenue. That by far, the largest sort of individual product within livestock. And so, certainly, as we anticipated, about a 20% impact in the first year, another 20% in the second year. The first year was a little bit better than that. It was south of 20%, but the second year is above that. And so, still in the neighborhood, maybe a little bit worse than what we thought initially, with respect to Jackson, but there's no other large product like that. I would say, in the portfolio, though Zoamix also has seen some competition, but it was nowhere near the size of a Jackson. So short story is, no change in terms of what we're seeing in terms of the competitiveness of livestock, is just a little bit more intensification in terms of products that have become generic if they are sizable. So I'll start and see if Kristin wants to add anything. With respect to the supply challenges, I think we've described in a fair amount of detail what we saw happen and why the impact was more noticeable in the third quarter, though we also made significant progress as we exited the quarter. So the impact that we're seeing in the third quarter, if we double-click on parasiticides, for example, particularly with Trio, I mean, from Q1, we have -- we've had outages on Trio across certain strengths, et cetera. And we continue to run with constraints throughout the year. But in particular, in Q2 and Q3, those outages really left more space across vet clinics for competitors to fill those shelves. And so, as we got into Q3, again, continuing to be in the parasiticide season, we saw switchovers with respect to new patients coming off of collars and topicals, for example, going into orals, rather than coming into our product going into some of our competitors, because our competitors filled shelves when we had gaps. So that's why we saw a bigger impact in that in terms of what we saw, particularly for Trio. Revolution's been an issue, quite frankly, throughout the year and remains so, even as we've gotten into Q4 here, which is why we say we continue to see uncertainty in certain products here. Vaccines, I would say, a relatively commonplace across the industry in terms of having supply issues. And again, we've seen a little bit more of those this year. And again, particularly in Q3, given the cattle run in the US in the fall, et cetera. So we saw some of that -- the impact of those outages more pronounced in the quarter. So hopefully, that gives you plenty, if there's a follow-up, I'm sure you can take it up with Steve offline as well. But that's the detail that we've shared. With respect to capacity for MABS, these are long lead time areas, right? If you take the time to manufacture, it's long lead time, the time to add capacity in monoclonal antibodies is also relatively long. So we've been working on those for some time, which is why, as we've gone through this year, we -- and we express confidence into next year being able to not only capitalize on demand that we see across Europe, but we'll be able to launch in other products outside of Europe across our international segment with confidence, because we have been able to expand in various areas. I won't go into a specific site in terms of what their capacity is. But suffice it to say, our monoclonal antibodies manufacturing is more than just one location in terms of where we do that. And you've seen us take an uptick as well in terms of CapEx going from last year to this year, we've talked about that all year. And you continue to see an uptick in CapEx as we go into the next year or two as well, because we continue to make investments in capacity and monoclonal antibodies are an important platform for us, not only with respect to derm with Cytopoint with the pain franchise, but other products that we're working on in our pipeline, we require those. So we'll continue to make investments with respect to MAB on capacity. Yes, I'll start. And -- and see, what Kristin will add. First of all, with respect to currency, if you look at this year, top line impact from FX, given the strength of the US dollar is about 4%. So on the year, 4% which is roughly $39 million headwind versus prior year rates. If you look at the impact all the way down to the bottom line, it's about 8%. And so, from an EPS standpoint, that's about $0.36 of headwind. It's about $0.07 worse than our prior guidance, given the continued strength of the US dollar. So that's where we are. We're not going to forecast what FX might do. But our guidance is based on where rates were at the end of October here. And we'll continue to update, but we'll focus on commentary around operational growth given, given FX impact, but that's the impact that we're seeing this year. But if I didn't go into price here, on a year-to-date basis, if you look at our companion animal product sales and revenues, we've taken about 5% price on a year-to-date basis. And so, what is offsetting that largely is what we've been talking about here today, which is, the generic competition, particularly on Jackson, that's offsetting that growth where you see a net of 1% in the quarter. But on a year-to-date basis, our price is about 2%. If you include the impact of generic competition and higher than that without -- but companion animal is where we have innovative products, we continue to see strong demand, and we're taking price to the tune of about 5%. And if you look at our margins, roughly 90 basis points down year-over-year, FX is by far the biggest contributor to that. So if you take FX out, you've got about 20 basis points. So essentially, our price is offsetting increases in manufacturing costs, et cetera, being price and mix and so on is what we're seeing. So that's where the offset is. We're right about where you might see across elsewhere in the industry, our vet practices, given the strong demand we continue to see are actually taking price at or above what we're taking in that 5% on companion animal as well. Yes. So we've been very pleased with the penetration across large corporate accounts. We're about 90%, but we still see more room, even within those large corporate accounts to increase utilization of Trio. And we continue to work on those, and that's part of where our expanded field force in the US is focused in addition to, obviously, with the launches of other products, et cetera, and across derm to continue to penetrate and so on. So we've been very pleased with the overall penetration across large corporates. We continue to work on smaller and mid-sized accounts as well. And we see more room within those penetrated clinics to get better utilization on Trio. I don't know if you would add anything to that, Kristin."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. Presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. And that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, August 4, 2022. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call for 2022. I'm pleased to say Zoetis delivered another strong quarter with 8% operational growth in revenue and 9% operational growth in adjusted net income, driven once again by the strength of our companion animal portfolio. We saw a balanced performance across our segments with similar operational revenue growth for both the U.S. and international, 9% and 8%, respectively. Our diversity and strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for pain continue to demonstrate people's desire for innovative and effective care for their pets. We continue to see positive spending trends across the globe for pet care. And we grew 14% operationally in our companion animal portfolio. As anticipated, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 1% operationally in the second quarter, largely due to generic competition primarily in U.S. cattle and declines in swine products in China due to lower pork prices and COVID-related supply constraints. Overall, our business remains strong, thanks to the durability of our global portfolio and a steady pipeline of new products. Even as we face uncertain macroeconomic conditions, continued supply constraints, generic competition and the war in Ukraine, we remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues. As we look to the rest of the year, we are updating and narrowing our guidance to reflect our positive outlook for the remainder of 2022 and the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. Wetteny will walk you through the details in his remarks. As we look at the second half of the year, we remain confident in our long-term growth drivers and our ability to maintain a steady supply for customers despite inflationary pressures on the global economy and ongoing constraints for certain products. We all know pet owners love their dogs and cats and pet care remains a very positive and robust market, showing little impact from broader consumer concerns with inflation for the global economy. As we expected during the pandemic, that clinic visits are normalizing over time and spending continues to show strong growth based on the latest U.S. numbers. The positive dynamic between pets and pet owners, which I've spoken about before, is proving sustainable and recession-resistant due to people's affinity for their pets, a willingness to prioritize medical care for their pets and key demographic drivers such as the increased pet ownership by Gen Z and millennials and the greater percentage of high income households owning pets. Our innovative companion animal portfolio is well suited to address these customer needs. Our key dermatology products continue to demonstrate strong growth, 22% operationally for the first half, and we see opportunity to expand in underpenetrated markets especially internationally and introduce life cycle innovations like Apoquel chewable tablets. We have more to come in the pipeline for dermatology, and we do not foresee any competitors for Apoquel or Cytopoint this year or in the first half of 2023. In terms of parasiticides, the Simparica franchise, including Simparica Trio, is performing extremely well. having grown 47% operationally through the first half of the year and is gaining share in the industry's largest category. We currently anticipate a competing triple-combination parasiticide to be approved in the U.S. in the next 6 months with a possible launch next year. However, we believe Trio will continue to grow based on a strong label, proven efficacy and the support of DTC marketing in the U.S. and international markets. Our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia, are performing very well in approved markets across Europe, and we remain very confident in the blockbuster potential of these breakthrough treatments. In terms of the U.S., we have begun early experience trials for Solensia and expect a broader market launch in the fourth quarter. And we still anticipate approval for Librela later this year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside the United States. Meanwhile, our operational growth in international has remained steady throughout the first half of the year at 8% despite COVID lockdowns in China and revenue reductions in Russia and Ukraine due to the war. Excluding the impact of Russia and Ukraine in the first half, our international sales would have grown 9% operationally. This is the latest example of how our diverse portfolio and global footprint drive steady and sustainable growth for the business. While some markets may be experiencing setbacks in the quarter, other markets like the U.S., Australia, Southern Europe and other emerging markets are driving our performance. In the second half, we see China returning to stronger growth if COVID stays in check, and we continue to expect the diversity across geographies and species to remain strong. In terms of livestock, we expect continued pressure from generic competition, primarily in U.S. cattle and poultry products. However, we are generating growth across various livestock species in markets outside the U.S. and fish continues to perform exceptionally well. Finally, like many companies, we are managing through supply constraints this year with certain products. We continue working hard to optimize our supply chain this year so we can meet the increasing demand for certain key products. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in the resources DTC marketing and manufacturing capacity we need to support of future growth and achieve results for our customer and shareholders. We\u2019re advancing our driven-to-care sustainability goals that were established last year. And we published our 2021 progress update and ESG metrics in the second quarter, highlighting achievements toward our DE&I aspirations, expanded clinic goals and support for the veterinary profession. We are committed to staying on our journey to be the most sustainable animal health company in the world. We also continue to invest in R&D, business development and new capabilities across the business to enhance our portfolio and ensure our long-term growth. In the second quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products like Poulvac, Procerta-HVT-IBD ND, expand key franchises like Apoquel into new markets and acquire new businesses to complement our portfolio such as Basepaws, a pet care genetics company. In closing, our business continues to perform extraordinarily well in one of the most dynamic markets I've ever seen. Diversity, innovation and customer focus are our cornerstones for excellence. I want to thank our colleagues for their tenacity, commitment and resilience as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Thank you. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny.\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises and the continued resilience of our end markets. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.1 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $567 million was flat on a reported basis and grew 9% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 5% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 6% from new products, which includes the Simparica Trio and Librela, 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 3%. The decline in other inline products was expected and largely the result of the impact of intermittent supply challenges and generic competition for Jackson. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 14% operationally with livestock declining 1% on an operational basis in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $237 million, representing operational growth of 72% versus the comparable 2021 period. We also continue to experience better-than-expected results from our Trio franchise outside the U.S. where we had sales of almost $30 million. We expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flea, tick and heartworm globally and see significant headroom for growth with brands like Simparica and Trio. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had significant global growth again with $315 million of revenue, representing 16% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products were 22% operationally in the second quarter of 2021. In Europe, our monoclonal antibodies, fostered pain in dogs and cats also meaningfully contributed to growth posting $31 million in sales. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $83 million in revenue in Q2, declining 9% operationally. Growth in our international diagnostics portfolio was more than offset by a decline in our U.S. business in the quarter. In the U.S., we experienced a decrease in sales resulting from our new grocery market model and the build-out of a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary fundamental elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run. We expect the effectiveness of our new diagnostic sales force to improve gradually for the remainder of the year. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Sales of livestock products declined 1% operationally in the quarter, negatively impacting growth across the portfolio were global generic competition for Jackson and the War in Ukraine. China swine products again declined due to lower pork prices and COVID-related lock downs. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to Zoetis. Meanwhile, our fish portfolio again grew double digits in the quarter. And along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline. Overall, livestock performance in the quarter continues to be in line with our expectations.  Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal products growing 13% and livestock sales declining 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. U.S. set practice revenue trends continue to be positive with practice revenue growing approximately 5%. Spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing over 7%. Visit declined more than 2%, primarily due to challenging prior year comparisons. In terms of best visit traffic, it is worth noting that business in the second quarter were above the number of visits pre-COVID in the second quarter of 2019 and the trend line for growth in visits over the last several years continues to slow favorably. I would also like to point out that our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. had volume growth of 8% in the quarter. Our injectable portfolio of products that must be administered in the vet clinic also saw volume growth in the quarter. These products include Cytopoint, vaccines and Poulvac. Underlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country even as people return to work. While labor challenges do exist as they do across most industries, we believe vet clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth of 13% in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from Simparica Trio as well as key dermatology products.  Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $208 million in the U.S., growing 74%. We are pleased to see that a significant number of Trio customers are new to the flea, tick and heartworm category altogether. In addition, we continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio. Key dermatology product sales were $219 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint is significantly contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our derm portfolio grew 16%. Our investments to support our derm portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. U.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by sales of cattle products as a result of generic competition for Jackson. Meanwhile, our poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. Swine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of increased disease prevalence and favorable market conditions for producers. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 16% operationally and loss lag revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products and the Simparica franchise. These core brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer promotional campaigns and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $26 million in Solensia delivering $5 million in second quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the number one pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations, and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. It is also worth noting that we are observing similar pet owner and vet clinic trends in many of our key international markets that we are seeing in the U.S. The higher standard of care and better demographics as well as a more rapid adoption of innovation continues to expand markets for our products and we expect these trends to continue. Volume growth in our international and companion animal portfolio was 10% in the second quarter, and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and Cytopoint. Meanwhile, international livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter with solid growth across fish, cattle and sheep. Our fish portfolio experienced increased demand for vaccines in key standard markets, including Chile and Norway. Cattle grew through favorable market conditions and price in key emerging markets, including Australia, Turkey, China and the U.K. Sales of sheep products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. Growth was partially offset by continued weakness with the price of pork and COVID-related supply challenges in China as well as unfavorable producer rotational programs with MFAs in Europe and reduced stock sizes in Latin America impacting poultry. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 120 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts as well as higher manufacturing, freight and other costs partially offset by favorable price and mix. Adjusted operating expense increased 10% operationally with SG&A growth of 8% operationally, driven by promotional and marketing expenses related to key brands and new product launches as well as T&E cost beginning to return to pre-COVID levels. R&D expenses increased 16% operationally due to higher compensation costs, increased spending on projects and higher operating costs. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, an increase of 70 basis points, driven by changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings and lower discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments. And finally, adjusted net income grew 9% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $146 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the back half of 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $600 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased only $450 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest share repurchase ever. Now moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are maintaining the midpoint and narrowing the range of growth to 9.5% to 10.5%, previously 9% to 11%. We are increasing our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 11% to 13%, previously 10% to 13%. This change in guidance signals increased confidence in the back half of the year due to the continuing outperformance of companion animal, easing of certain supply constraints and an improvement in our business in China. Please note that our guidance for adjusted interest expense and/or ID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance as of late July and reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to the narrowing of our range and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.325 billion. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.97 to $5.05 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.75. While guidance possess our outlook for the full year due to the unique factors impacting our business in 2022, I would like to note that our guidance for growth, especially for revenue and adjusted net income will be rated towards the end of the year. While we expect operating expenses to be incurred at a similar rate across that half of the year, we are noting an easier OpEx pop in Q4 than Q3 due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter of last year. Also, in Q3 of last year, we experienced an unusually low adjusted effective tax rate of 16.7% due to favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income and certain discrete items. We do not expect similar favorability this year. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster in the market. and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term. Our success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation, and an infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Riskin Of Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: I'm going to try to squeeze in two real quick. First, on the -- your comments on the Trio competition, Kristin, certainly something that's been talked about and anticipated for a while. But I'm curious if you have any updated thoughts on how you'll respond? Is there going to be a change to how you price Simparica Trio or any additional promotional or do you see plants you can try to implement in the next 6 months. And I'm wondering if it's too early to give us maybe a ballpark dollar target for next year. Is it great to think that you could hit $1 billion in Trio sales in 2023. And then a quick follow-up, if I can. On margins for the year, when I'm hoping you could -- can you walk us impact to margins, both on gross margin and OpEx. Just wondering how that factors into the updated outlook.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll take the first one, Mike. Thanks for the question. For starters, we were really pleased with performance of Simparica Trio and Simparica franchise in the quarter with 72% growth. And we do expect even with competition to grow the franchise here -- what we're really seeing in the market is a strong shift from topicals and collars to worlds. There's a new standard of care. So we see the category certainly growing. We still believe we've got some number of advantages from being first to market. We've gotten a lot of customers enrolled in auto shift, which is really helping continue to drive growth there. We've got strong relationships with the large corporate. But importantly, on that issue, we still believe we've got significant room to expand in our penetrated clinics as we look at where our penetration within those clinics is. The other thing is, we really don't believe you're going to see tons of switching without significant differentiation, which honestly we're not really expecting. This remains a significant market. And right now, the Simparica franchise is number two in the U.S. and flea tick heartworm. So we are expecting approval of a potential competitor sometime in the back half of this year and then obviously launching likely sometime next year. But we continue to believe that we can grow the franchise. We're going to invest highly in that through direct-to-consumer through our field force. And we believe, given all the issues and opportunities we have, we can continue to grow this franchise.\nWetteny Joseph: And Mike, your question on margins and OpEx. If you look at our gross margins on a year-to-date basis, if you take out the impact of FX, we're running about 20 basis points above last year. So in the quarter, you saw gross margins down about 120 basis points, but it's all FX driven. We've effectively maintained OpEx growth range in our guidance, and we're able to raise the bottom line guidance to 11% to 13% versus 10% to 13% that we started the year with. So again, FX is having an impact here but we are executing into our plan, and we'll see an improvement even on the bottom line growth rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Could we get an update on Librela, both the U.S. approval and the supply chain constraints for that product in international markets. At this point, do you think you have visibility if supply chain constraints will have any sort of impact on the U.S. launch in terms of timing? And after you do get approval in the U.S., will you be ready to broadly launch that product immediately. And then just in terms of the guidance, how should we be thinking about what's embedded in the guidance for companion animal and livestock growth for the balance of the year? Are there any sort of dynamics from a quarter-to-quarter basis that we should be thinking about?\nKristin Peck: I'll take the first one, Wetteny can take that second question. We are really pleased so far in the Librela success outside of the U.S., and we'll talk a little bit what I think the implication therefore are within the U.S. Right now, Librela is the number one awaiting product in dogs in the EU already, which we think is outstanding if you look at its success, it's really been embraced and we see very strong reorder rates right now. Really impressively, 40% of dogs are new to the category, and we're seeing a 90% reorder rate. So we're really pleased. This is a product, as you've noted, that does share some components with human COVID vaccines. And we've been managing that very carefully, making sure as we launch that we have adequate supply since this is a chronic medication. Really have been thoughtful about that. We do believe we've got additional capacity coming on in some of our suppliers as we look into the second half of this year and into next year. So as we look at the rest of this year, we -- as we said, we believe this product will be a blockbuster this year, over $100 million. And we're very optimistic, assuming we get the approvals we're expecting an infection this year to be able to move exactly as we did it Solensia next year with an early experience in the first half followed by a full launch. So remain very excited investing heavily behind this and believe we're working really hard in the supply chain unless something changes dramatically, we are confident we will have the supply we need for a successful launch in the U.S. next year.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, Erin, with respect to our guidance and how you should be thinking about companion animal versus livestock. And so far year-to-date, we've delivered 9% operational growth at the top line, losses driven by companion animal. I think you can expect that to continue in the back half of the year when you consider, as Kristin just mentioned, Solensia will be fully launched in the second half in the U.S. here, we'll continue to see growth in Trio and with Librela, which we expect to be a blockbuster in the EU this year, we delivered $21 million in the first quarter, $26 million in the second quarter. So that will continue to ramp. So I think those will contribute towards comparing that will continue to drive. When I think about livestock, we do see easier comps in the back half than we would have had in the first half to recall swine in China, for example, prices start to really decline in the second half of last year. So that becomes a comp when you think about Q3 and Q4. And then for cattle, we did have some price adjustments in the fourth quarter last year on Jackson leading into the start of the year. So those make for a slightly easier comp from a cattle perspective in the fourth quarter. So those are sort of the considerations, but I would expect the second half to look more like the first half in terms of the contribution from companion animal compared to livestock.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Block of Stifel.\nJon Block: I'll try to ask two logos upfront. Key derm, I think it was up 22% operationally in 1H, but I think it slowed from 27% in 1Q to 16% in 2Q, and I got a sort of a similar year ago comp. So can you talk to, Kristin, your thoughts on the topic derm growth call it, just the trajectory going forward? Does the chewable version offer a price premium for you guys? And I think, Kristin, you also talked about just no competition for maybe in the next 10 months, just how you have that line of sight. And then shifting to your second question to livestock. That market just always seems to be evolving. Would love to get your thoughts on normalized growth returning to the industry in 2023, Kris, I think you called it out last quarter. Does that stay intact? And would your growth be representative of market since I think you're going to get soon on the back end of some of the generic headwinds that you've been facing.\nKristin Peck: I'll take the first question, let me take the second one on livestock. We are very pleased with continued growth of derm. To your point, in the first 6 months of the year, it grew 22% and in the quarter, it was 16%. There always has been some cyclicality, but we really believe we can continue to grow this franchise. We can expand it -- we have been through both branded and unbranded DTC. As you know, we just began this year really an investment in unbranded DTC in Europe, where we're now seeing significant pickup there. We continue to see people home with Passmore and importantly, they are still in the U.S. alone, 6 million dogs who are still issuing who do not get -- have not received the product. So we think we can continue to grow this. To your question on competition and life cycle innovation, we are investing heavily behind life cycle innovation. This is our category, as you saw last year, the franchise is already worth $1 billion. So we will work heavily to defend this, both with chewable and with other products in the pipeline. Chewable is a real advantage for a lot of people who have trouble giving tools to their dogs and getting them to take it. I would say there may be a slight price depending it's very market specific as you look at the pricing there. But to us, it's really building the loyalty to our franchise overall. We don't have on the competition. As you know, it's not a perfect science in our industry. But as you saw, we did on the Simparica Trio sense that we do see competition. Mostly that is through working with chatter in the marketplace as well as with distributors and our large corporates, who start negotiating differently with us when they believe there's going to be competition in a space. So we are not seeing that in the same way that we are just starting to see that now on competition for our Simparica Trio franchise. So we continue to believe we can grow this franchise with new innovation, with the strength of our commercial infrastructure with our investment in DTC. So I'll let Wetteny take the second question on livestock.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. When you look at livestock, historically, we've seen livestock grow around the 4% range. Certainly, you're very familiar with what's happened in the last few years in terms of ASF and for us, with generic competition with Jackson and Zoamix, the year is essentially executing as we expected on livestock. We continue to believe that we can see livestock returning to normalized growth in the 2023-2024 time frame. And long term, when you look at livestock, we continue to see growth in this business long term, given population growth. We see urbanization as well as growing middle class, particularly as you look across emerging markets. And even this year, if you look at this quarter, for example, livestock grew 2% internationally, despite the headwinds in swine as I said, those comps get easier in the back half. And if you Russia-Ukraine, for example, another point there. So we're seeing growth in emerging markets on livestock. We expect those to continue in long term with innovation as well as we continue our swine vaccines that we are launching vector vaccines on the poultry side, immunotherapies [Indiscernible], et cetera, we would expect to continue to drive growth in livestock long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Rains of William Blair.\nChristine Rains: Just piggybacking off of that last point, can you further review those pipeline highlights in the work for our livestock portfolio. And just related on the comparatively well international growth in livestock this quarter. Can you discuss the factors there that drive the different performance between international and domestic here?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Sure, I'd be happy to do that. Look, I think as we entered the year, we expected given the second year of generic competition for Jackson, our largest product in cattle and to some extent, in swine as well. We expected that to drag our livestock performance in the U.S. And again, that's essentially executing as we thought. What that is masking somewhat is the innovation that we are launching in swine for example, with vaccines in swine or vector vaccines that we have been launching will continue to drive in livestock as well. But we are seeing growth in emerging markets. You saw 2% growth in the quarter. But again, that was offset partially with Russia-Ukraine impact here given the conflict there, as well as swine, as you know, from the second half of last year, we've seen a decrease in price that has impacted the performance there, although we have seen a lift in price on swine over the last number of weeks or months in China, we expect to continue as we execute through the second half of the year.\nKristin Peck: Yes, I'll take a little bit more on your question on the pipeline and livestock. To build on what Wetteny saying, we do continue to believe that we're -- that there's significant growth opportunities in vaccines and livestock, that's what our customers are looking for. As Wetteny referenced, we've been launching some vaccines in swine. Certainly, vector vaccines, we just announced approval of the second vector vaccine. In poultry, we'll be launching more vector vaccines, not poultry franchise as well. Really excited, as I mentioned earlier, about fish with 23% growth in the quarter. Apoquel really focusing on [Indiscernible] and other potential vaccines there. And then if you look at that more broadly as we look out a little farther investment immunotherapies as well as in precision livestock farming, continuing to add to our block yard product there to our genetics business there. So we do see a number of key platforms in livestock to drive innovation in the space. As Wetteny said, I think you can get back to the historical growth rates of around 4% as we hopefully lap some of these generic issues around Jackson and Zoamix and poultry and the ASF issue in China. But I think to get above that, which we certainly aspire to do, it's going to take bringing innovation, and we are certainly investing to be the leader in innovation in livestock.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Kristin, you talked about the capacity and labor constraints that clinics are facing. But I think you noted vaccines and injectable products continue to grow. I guess could you maybe talk to your ability to continue to grow those products the current market backdrop. And I guess, ultimately, the bigger picture question is, if we see these market dynamics, both from a macro standpoint as well as some of the pressures that vet clinics are facing continue into next year. I guess -- how should we think about growth? I guess, should we expect a similar level of companion animal growth as to what you're guiding to in the back half?\nKristin Peck: Sure. I think what's important to keep in mind is that vet clinics are doing quite well. If you look at growth in vet clinic revenue since 2019, it's up 20%. There's definitely with a 5% increase in the number of pets in the U.S. There are capacity constraints to meeting all the needs. But I think what's important to remember also is we are not leveraged as high as some other businesses to in-clinic visits. A lot of our key products are chronic. So if you look at our derm portfolio, our tariff portfolio, et cetera, we're still seeing tremendous growth. We had a 10% volume increase in the quarter in U.S. products. So I think it's important to think there's more movement to online and other spaces. So we don't see some of these capacity issues as a major issue for us in continuing to grow our business. You're seeing some of the same capacity strength in Europe, and yet you're already seeing us have Librela looking to be a blockbuster product this year. And I think what really differentiates us is innovation. When there's important science and new products that they're excited about, we're still seeing great attention at the vet clinic for that and really driving that through. Although a lot of people are very focused on vet visits given we're not as leveraged to that. We really think the spend per visit is really important. And I think we're leading in that category given innovation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Cantor Fitzgerald.\nLouise Chen: I'd like to ask you, are there any metrics that you can point due to support price and demand elasticity in the pet health space? And then, do you think about this the same way in livestock?\nWetteny Joseph: Well, I think certainly, when we look at price and demand, we've continued to see opportunistic price at or above inflation, and we've demonstrated that over the years, particularly in certain markets. We've also looked at data in terms of pet ownership and demographically, we see the structural improvement, I would say, even compared to a very strong basis to begin with. So if you look at pet ownership with respect to Gen Z and millennials, and they're prioritizing pet health that certainly bodes well. But also, we're seeing more adoption at higher income households if you look at what adoption numbers look like over the last number of years, which again is structurally very positive for the industry. So as we've taken price over the years and we took about 5% price on -- in companion animal this year. Overall for the company, we've been running about 3% net given some of the last slight dynamics of the Jackson generic competition. But we haven't been able to take price. And yet we still continue to see strong volume growth across the business. And to Kristin's point, that's largely driven as well by innovation in the space. So we continue to see elasticity in terms of ability to take price see from an inflationary perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James.\nElliot Wilbur: Just a follow-up question for Kristin around parasiticide trends in the quarter. Can you maybe just talk about category growth overall? It seemed like some of the metrics out there suggested that overall category growth had actually been down. And obviously, Trio continues to perform extraordinarily well, particularly in the U.S. But I'm just thinking about the second half of the year and then early next year with a potential entrant, what you're seeing in terms of category growth? And if you could just give us the number in terms of where Simparica is with respect to overall share in the category. And if I could just get a quick follow-up in here on Librela. Obviously, the initial EU experience has been quite positive here. I think you mentioned that 40% of pets were new to therapy. Just wanted to get maybe an update in terms of what you're seeing with respect to persistence some of the pets that started therapy initially and sort of where we what kind of persistence rates you're seeing sort of 6 to 7 months after beginning therapy? And is that 40%, is that sort of a normal number in terms of new pets coming into the market or should the takeaway there be that Librela sort of test really kind of elevated the overall category growth?\nKristin Peck: I'll start with your Librela and see if maybe Wetteny can add anything on the tariff point. Really good questions there on Librela. If you look at the 40% new to the category, we do think that's extraordinary. This is an established category. This isn't like derm when we started where it wasn't really a category. There have been many products across the globe for dogs, for pain management. But I think it really underscores the challenges with the existing therapies. There's -- the trade-offs and safety and efficacy have been significant. Most of those therapies, you can't stay on for very long. And I think -- so for a lot of people that really didn't want to deal with some of those side effects that they had stayed out of the category. I think was something with the label that we have with a monoclonal antibody, we are clearly bringing new people to the sector, and we're growing that sector significantly. I think we talked about before, the global market for pain for dogs was around $400 million. We believe with the addition of Librela that we can double the size of that market over time and move that to 800, and we think we can do that from a few ways and one of them you referenced. One is people staying on therapy longer. Certainly, with a safe and efficacious product, we believe we can increase days on therapy. I think we can also be demonstrated with 40% increase the number of pets getting it. And third, we think we can grow the market certainly based on price. This is a premium product with significant innovation. So we are really pleased with the 40% growth. It is certainly higher than even we were expecting with the new patients to the category. We are seeing significant -- probably higher than we were expected initially, compliant to the sense of months on therapy. So we remain extremely optimistic about EU and the persistence of this growth. And I'll let Wetteny take your follow-up question on Simparica.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. When we look at the category, we speaking, clearly, Trio grew 72% in the quarter. If you look at our overall Simparica franchise, grew 47%, right? So if you get Simparica, not Trio, but Simparica internationally, it grew 23% in the quarter. So we have the broadest offering into the parasiticides in the industry. And clearly, the only triple combination in the U.S. What we are seeing is, categorically, we're seeing a shift from topicals and collars to all medications. And if you look at triple combination in the U.S. One of the interesting statistics that we've seen is that on Trio, about 30% of the dogs that are coming on Trio are new to the category and not having been prescribed a prescription of parasiticide in the prior 18 months or so. So we do see significant room to continue to expand in this space. And as competitors come into the space, there'll be more DTC that will drive even more patients for the clinic, which is beneficial for us as well given our relationships across corporate accounts and so on will benefit from having more voices out driving more patients into the clinic. So we're not seeing a slowdown in the category. There is a bit of a shift from the topicals and collars into rolls and that benefits us given our premium products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Balaji Prasad of Barclays.\nBalaji Prasad: Firstly, as we start to lap the impact of generics on Draxxin and Zoamix, would you still count a threat of generalization as a top two or top three challenge over the next two years? And if you could also add some broader comments around the percentage of your portfolio exposed to general completion of this period. Also on diagnostics, operational decline of 9%, it seems to be the first quarter of decline after Q2 2020 and in contrast to your per visits results. So wondering what kind of increased spend per visit did you notice that you've been calling out over the past few months? And any metrics that you can direct to between point of sale or reference labs that helps us understand this performance?\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with your diagnostics and then I will let Wetteny do the Draxxin livestock question. As you look at -- we're about flat in the first half of the year in diagnostics. And as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, as you saw the decline, really, there was growth in international. We made a huge investment in creating a stand-alone diagnostics field force and technical team and service team in the U.S. is highly disruptive. As you know, if you watch other companies do this over time. So -- but we do believe in the absolute strength of this business long term, investing in it long term, as you've seen, we've invested in innovation and our images platform, et cetera. to grow this business. So obviously, as that people get into new territories, et cetera, there's obviously some disruption that happens there. This honestly was anticipated. We remain extremely optimistic in the growth of this business and the strength of it. We certainly look at the strength of our international business and how well that's been doing and growing that with customers. We invested in diagnostics for the long term. and really believe we can drive strong growth here. And diagnostics as a sector is -- grows faster than the overall animal health space. And we believe we can bring disruptive innovation to the space to help us drive that. But I'll let Wetteny take the follow-up question on livestock and Draxxin.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. If you look at Draxxin, right, the largest product that we have across our livestock portfolio. Beyond that, there isn't any other product that's even nearly that size and magnitude if you look across our portfolio as well in companion animals, there or products that are anywhere near any sort of LOE. So we would not anticipate after the first two years, that the generic competition element will be the key driver here in the business. As we said, we expect lifestyle to be returning back to sort of normalized growth in the '23-'24 time frame is what we would expect in that regard to a generic standpoint.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.\nEkaterina Knyazkova: This is Ekaterina on from Chris from JPMorgan. And my question is on the macroeconomic environment here, are you seeing any notable differences when it comes to panel demand across geographies -- so Europe appears to be getting hit harder by some of the challenges related to fuel costs to food prices and stuff like that. And I was wondering if you're starting to see any changes in behavior in that market.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Ekaterina. Good to have you on the call today. As you look at the sort of macroeconomics, we continue to see, on a global basis, very strong demand. And I think what's driving that for us is the innovation that we bring to the market, as well as who's adopting some of these dogs, millennial Gen Z who are more willing to spend more on their pets as well as more of the pets being adopted by high-income families. That being said, Ekaterina, as you double-click into individual markets, you are seeing as economies get affected, obviously, overall demand may go down, but not -- we have so far not seen to do our products we are monitoring it carefully. I think the one place where we're starting to see a little more of that might be Latin America, just given some of the real hyperinflationary markets that you're starting to see there. But what we've really been pleased about in companion animal is the continued strength in willingness to spend and investing in innovative disruptive technology. So there are certainly differences as you get into individual markets across the globe overall continued strong demand. And I would double-click for you since you asked the global question in a few places. One in Brazil, where we only printed about 1% growth in Q2 overall. Companion animals still grew 35% in the quarter, and you look at China, where we only had 3% growth companion animal grew 24%. So even in what many people might consider emerging markets, we are still seeing incredibly strong demand for our products and for our innovation.\nOperator: And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd be happy to return the call to our host for any concluding remarks.\nKristin Peck: Great. Look, thank you, everyone, for your questions and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, we see continued strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our companion animal and pet care products. We are continuing to invest in talent and innovation and manufacturing expansions that can support our future growth. And we are updating and narrowing our full year guidance to reflect a positive outlook for the remainder of 2022 and obviously, as many other companies, the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. So I look forward to keeping you updated on future calls. Thanks so much. Have a great day.\nOperator: This does conclude the Zoetis Q2 2022 earnings conference. You may now disconnect your lines, and everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter earnings call for 2022. I'm pleased to say Zoetis delivered another strong quarter with 8% operational growth in revenue and 9% operational growth in adjusted net income, driven once again by the strength of our companion animal portfolio. We saw a balanced performance across our segments with similar operational revenue growth for both the U.S. and international, 9% and 8%, respectively. Our diversity and strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies for pain continue to demonstrate people's desire for innovative and effective care for their pets. We continue to see positive spending trends across the globe for pet care. And we grew 14% operationally in our companion animal portfolio. As anticipated, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 1% operationally in the second quarter, largely due to generic competition primarily in U.S. cattle and declines in swine products in China due to lower pork prices and COVID-related supply constraints. Overall, our business remains strong, thanks to the durability of our global portfolio and a steady pipeline of new products. Even as we face uncertain macroeconomic conditions, continued supply constraints, generic competition and the war in Ukraine, we remain confident in the resilience of our business and colleagues. As we look to the rest of the year, we are updating and narrowing our guidance to reflect our positive outlook for the remainder of 2022 and the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. Wetteny will walk you through the details in his remarks. As we look at the second half of the year, we remain confident in our long-term growth drivers and our ability to maintain a steady supply for customers despite inflationary pressures on the global economy and ongoing constraints for certain products. We all know pet owners love their dogs and cats and pet care remains a very positive and robust market, showing little impact from broader consumer concerns with inflation for the global economy. As we expected during the pandemic, that clinic visits are normalizing over time and spending continues to show strong growth based on the latest U.S. numbers. The positive dynamic between pets and pet owners, which I've spoken about before, is proving sustainable and recession-resistant due to people's affinity for their pets, a willingness to prioritize medical care for their pets and key demographic drivers such as the increased pet ownership by Gen Z and millennials and the greater percentage of high income households owning pets. Our innovative companion animal portfolio is well suited to address these customer needs. Our key dermatology products continue to demonstrate strong growth, 22% operationally for the first half, and we see opportunity to expand in underpenetrated markets especially internationally and introduce life cycle innovations like Apoquel chewable tablets. We have more to come in the pipeline for dermatology, and we do not foresee any competitors for Apoquel or Cytopoint this year or in the first half of 2023. In terms of parasiticides, the Simparica franchise, including Simparica Trio, is performing extremely well. having grown 47% operationally through the first half of the year and is gaining share in the industry's largest category. We currently anticipate a competing triple-combination parasiticide to be approved in the U.S. in the next 6 months with a possible launch next year. However, we believe Trio will continue to grow based on a strong label, proven efficacy and the support of DTC marketing in the U.S. and international markets. Our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia, are performing very well in approved markets across Europe, and we remain very confident in the blockbuster potential of these breakthrough treatments. In terms of the U.S., we have begun early experience trials for Solensia and expect a broader market launch in the fourth quarter. And we still anticipate approval for Librela later this year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside the United States. Meanwhile, our operational growth in international has remained steady throughout the first half of the year at 8% despite COVID lockdowns in China and revenue reductions in Russia and Ukraine due to the war. Excluding the impact of Russia and Ukraine in the first half, our international sales would have grown 9% operationally. This is the latest example of how our diverse portfolio and global footprint drive steady and sustainable growth for the business. While some markets may be experiencing setbacks in the quarter, other markets like the U.S., Australia, Southern Europe and other emerging markets are driving our performance. In the second half, we see China returning to stronger growth if COVID stays in check, and we continue to expect the diversity across geographies and species to remain strong. In terms of livestock, we expect continued pressure from generic competition, primarily in U.S. cattle and poultry products. However, we are generating growth across various livestock species in markets outside the U.S. and fish continues to perform exceptionally well. Finally, like many companies, we are managing through supply constraints this year with certain products. We continue working hard to optimize our supply chain this year so we can meet the increasing demand for certain key products. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in the resources DTC marketing and manufacturing capacity we need to support of future growth and achieve results for our customer and shareholders. We're advancing our driven-to-care sustainability goals that were established last year. And we published our 2021 progress update and ESG metrics in the second quarter, highlighting achievements toward our DE&I aspirations, expanded clinic goals and support for the veterinary profession. We are committed to staying on our journey to be the most sustainable animal health company in the world. We also continue to invest in R&D, business development and new capabilities across the business to enhance our portfolio and ensure our long-term growth. In the second quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products like Poulvac, Procerta-HVT-IBD ND, expand key franchises like Apoquel into new markets and acquire new businesses to complement our portfolio such as Basepaws, a pet care genetics company. In closing, our business continues to perform extraordinarily well in one of the most dynamic markets I've ever seen. Diversity, innovation and customer focus are our cornerstones for excellence. I want to thank our colleagues for their tenacity, commitment and resilience as we continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. Thank you. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny. Sure. I'll take the first one, Mike. Thanks for the question. For starters, we were really pleased with performance of Simparica Trio and Simparica franchise in the quarter with 72% growth. And we do expect even with competition to grow the franchise here -- what we're really seeing in the market is a strong shift from topicals and collars to worlds. There's a new standard of care. So we see the category certainly growing. We still believe we've got some number of advantages from being first to market. We've gotten a lot of customers enrolled in auto shift, which is really helping continue to drive growth there. We've got strong relationships with the large corporate. But importantly, on that issue, we still believe we've got significant room to expand in our penetrated clinics as we look at where our penetration within those clinics is. The other thing is, we really don't believe you're going to see tons of switching without significant differentiation, which honestly we're not really expecting. This remains a significant market. And right now, the Simparica franchise is number two in the U.S. and flea tick heartworm. So we are expecting approval of a potential competitor sometime in the back half of this year and then obviously launching likely sometime next year. But we continue to believe that we can grow the franchise. We're going to invest highly in that through direct-to-consumer through our field force. And we believe, given all the issues and opportunities we have, we can continue to grow this franchise. I'll take the first one, Wetteny can take that second question. We are really pleased so far in the Librela success outside of the U.S., and we'll talk a little bit what I think the implication therefore are within the U.S. Right now, Librela is the number one awaiting product in dogs in the EU already, which we think is outstanding if you look at its success, it's really been embraced and we see very strong reorder rates right now. Really impressively, 40% of dogs are new to the category, and we're seeing a 90% reorder rate. So we're really pleased. This is a product, as you've noted, that does share some components with human COVID vaccines. And we've been managing that very carefully, making sure as we launch that we have adequate supply since this is a chronic medication. Really have been thoughtful about that. We do believe we've got additional capacity coming on in some of our suppliers as we look into the second half of this year and into next year. So as we look at the rest of this year, we -- as we said, we believe this product will be a blockbuster this year, over $100 million. And we're very optimistic, assuming we get the approvals we're expecting an infection this year to be able to move exactly as we did it Solensia next year with an early experience in the first half followed by a full launch. So remain very excited investing heavily behind this and believe we're working really hard in the supply chain unless something changes dramatically, we are confident we will have the supply we need for a successful launch in the U.S. next year. I'll take the first question, let me take the second one on livestock. We are very pleased with continued growth of derm. To your point, in the first 6 months of the year, it grew 22% and in the quarter, it was 16%. There always has been some cyclicality, but we really believe we can continue to grow this franchise. We can expand it -- we have been through both branded and unbranded DTC. As you know, we just began this year really an investment in unbranded DTC in Europe, where we're now seeing significant pickup there. We continue to see people home with Passmore and importantly, they are still in the U.S. alone, 6 million dogs who are still issuing who do not get -- have not received the product. So we think we can continue to grow this. To your question on competition and life cycle innovation, we are investing heavily behind life cycle innovation. This is our category, as you saw last year, the franchise is already worth $1 billion. So we will work heavily to defend this, both with chewable and with other products in the pipeline. Chewable is a real advantage for a lot of people who have trouble giving tools to their dogs and getting them to take it. I would say there may be a slight price depending it's very market specific as you look at the pricing there. But to us, it's really building the loyalty to our franchise overall. We don't have on the competition. As you know, it's not a perfect science in our industry. But as you saw, we did on the Simparica Trio sense that we do see competition. Mostly that is through working with chatter in the marketplace as well as with distributors and our large corporates, who start negotiating differently with us when they believe there's going to be competition in a space. So we are not seeing that in the same way that we are just starting to see that now on competition for our Simparica Trio franchise. So we continue to believe we can grow this franchise with new innovation, with the strength of our commercial infrastructure with our investment in DTC. So I'll let Wetteny take the second question on livestock. Yes, I'll take a little bit more on your question on the pipeline and livestock. To build on what Wetteny saying, we do continue to believe that we're -- that there's significant growth opportunities in vaccines and livestock, that's what our customers are looking for. As Wetteny referenced, we've been launching some vaccines in swine. Certainly, vector vaccines, we just announced approval of the second vector vaccine. In poultry, we'll be launching more vector vaccines, not poultry franchise as well. Really excited, as I mentioned earlier, about fish with 23% growth in the quarter. Apoquel really focusing on [Indiscernible] and other potential vaccines there. And then if you look at that more broadly as we look out a little farther investment immunotherapies as well as in precision livestock farming, continuing to add to our block yard product there to our genetics business there. So we do see a number of key platforms in livestock to drive innovation in the space. As Wetteny said, I think you can get back to the historical growth rates of around 4% as we hopefully lap some of these generic issues around Jackson and Zoamix and poultry and the ASF issue in China. But I think to get above that, which we certainly aspire to do, it's going to take bringing innovation, and we are certainly investing to be the leader in innovation in livestock. Sure. I think what's important to keep in mind is that vet clinics are doing quite well. If you look at growth in vet clinic revenue since 2019, it's up 20%. There's definitely with a 5% increase in the number of pets in the U.S. There are capacity constraints to meeting all the needs. But I think what's important to remember also is we are not leveraged as high as some other businesses to in-clinic visits. A lot of our key products are chronic. So if you look at our derm portfolio, our tariff portfolio, et cetera, we're still seeing tremendous growth. We had a 10% volume increase in the quarter in U.S. products. So I think it's important to think there's more movement to online and other spaces. So we don't see some of these capacity issues as a major issue for us in continuing to grow our business. You're seeing some of the same capacity strength in Europe, and yet you're already seeing us have Librela looking to be a blockbuster product this year. And I think what really differentiates us is innovation. When there's important science and new products that they're excited about, we're still seeing great attention at the vet clinic for that and really driving that through. Although a lot of people are very focused on vet visits given we're not as leveraged to that. We really think the spend per visit is really important. And I think we're leading in that category given innovation. I'll start with your Librela and see if maybe Wetteny can add anything on the tariff point. Really good questions there on Librela. If you look at the 40% new to the category, we do think that's extraordinary. This is an established category. This isn't like derm when we started where it wasn't really a category. There have been many products across the globe for dogs, for pain management. But I think it really underscores the challenges with the existing therapies. There's -- the trade-offs and safety and efficacy have been significant. Most of those therapies, you can't stay on for very long. And I think -- so for a lot of people that really didn't want to deal with some of those side effects that they had stayed out of the category. I think was something with the label that we have with a monoclonal antibody, we are clearly bringing new people to the sector, and we're growing that sector significantly. I think we talked about before, the global market for pain for dogs was around $400 million. We believe with the addition of Librela that we can double the size of that market over time and move that to 800, and we think we can do that from a few ways and one of them you referenced. One is people staying on therapy longer. Certainly, with a safe and efficacious product, we believe we can increase days on therapy. I think we can also be demonstrated with 40% increase the number of pets getting it. And third, we think we can grow the market certainly based on price. This is a premium product with significant innovation. So we are really pleased with the 40% growth. It is certainly higher than even we were expecting with the new patients to the category. We are seeing significant -- probably higher than we were expected initially, compliant to the sense of months on therapy. So we remain extremely optimistic about EU and the persistence of this growth. And I'll let Wetteny take your follow-up question on Simparica. Sure. I'll start with your diagnostics and then I will let Wetteny do the Draxxin livestock question. As you look at -- we're about flat in the first half of the year in diagnostics. And as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, as you saw the decline, really, there was growth in international. We made a huge investment in creating a stand-alone diagnostics field force and technical team and service team in the U.S. is highly disruptive. As you know, if you watch other companies do this over time. So -- but we do believe in the absolute strength of this business long term, investing in it long term, as you've seen, we've invested in innovation and our images platform, et cetera. to grow this business. So obviously, as that people get into new territories, et cetera, there's obviously some disruption that happens there. This honestly was anticipated. We remain extremely optimistic in the growth of this business and the strength of it. We certainly look at the strength of our international business and how well that's been doing and growing that with customers. We invested in diagnostics for the long term. and really believe we can drive strong growth here. And diagnostics as a sector is -- grows faster than the overall animal health space. And we believe we can bring disruptive innovation to the space to help us drive that. But I'll let Wetteny take the follow-up question on livestock and Draxxin. Sure. Thanks, Ekaterina. Good to have you on the call today. As you look at the sort of macroeconomics, we continue to see, on a global basis, very strong demand. And I think what's driving that for us is the innovation that we bring to the market, as well as who's adopting some of these dogs, millennial Gen Z who are more willing to spend more on their pets as well as more of the pets being adopted by high-income families. That being said, Ekaterina, as you double-click into individual markets, you are seeing as economies get affected, obviously, overall demand may go down, but not -- we have so far not seen to do our products we are monitoring it carefully. I think the one place where we're starting to see a little more of that might be Latin America, just given some of the real hyperinflationary markets that you're starting to see there. But what we've really been pleased about in companion animal is the continued strength in willingness to spend and investing in innovative disruptive technology. So there are certainly differences as you get into individual markets across the globe overall continued strong demand. And I would double-click for you since you asked the global question in a few places. One in Brazil, where we only printed about 1% growth in Q2 overall. Companion animals still grew 35% in the quarter, and you look at China, where we only had 3% growth companion animal grew 24%. So even in what many people might consider emerging markets, we are still seeing incredibly strong demand for our products and for our innovation. Great. Look, thank you, everyone, for your questions and for your continued interest in Zoetis. Just to summarize, we see continued strength across our diverse global portfolio, especially in our companion animal and pet care products. We are continuing to invest in talent and innovation and manufacturing expansions that can support our future growth. And we are updating and narrowing our full year guidance to reflect a positive outlook for the remainder of 2022 and obviously, as many other companies, the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. So I look forward to keeping you updated on future calls. Thanks so much. Have a great day."

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong quarter with growth across a number of our core franchises and the continued resilience of our end markets. Today, I will focus my comments on our second quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.1 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $567 million was flat on a reported basis and grew 9% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 3% is from price and 5% from volume. Volume growth consisted of 6% from new products, which includes the Simparica Trio and Librela, 2% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 3%. The decline in other inline products was expected and largely the result of the impact of intermittent supply challenges and generic competition for Jackson. Companion animal products continue to be the primary driver of growth, growing 14% operationally with livestock declining 1% on an operational basis in the quarter. Simparica Trio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter. Trio posted global revenue of $237 million, representing operational growth of 72% versus the comparable 2021 period. We also continue to experience better-than-expected results from our Trio franchise outside the U.S. where we had sales of almost $30 million. We expect to continue to grow the addressable market for flea, tick and heartworm globally and see significant headroom for growth with brands like Simparica and Trio. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had significant global growth again with $315 million of revenue, representing 16% operational growth against a robust prior year in which these products were 22% operationally in the second quarter of 2021. In Europe, our monoclonal antibodies, fostered pain in dogs and cats also meaningfully contributed to growth posting $31 million in sales. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $83 million in revenue in Q2, declining 9% operationally. Growth in our international diagnostics portfolio was more than offset by a decline in our U.S. business in the quarter. In the U.S., we experienced a decrease in sales resulting from our new grocery market model and the build-out of a sizable and new dedicated field force for diagnostics. While disruptive in the short term, this investment is putting the necessary fundamental elements in place to position and grow our diagnostics portfolio over the long run. We expect the effectiveness of our new diagnostic sales force to improve gradually for the remainder of the year. Diagnostics remains core to our business and a key long-term growth driver for Zoetis. Sales of livestock products declined 1% operationally in the quarter, negatively impacting growth across the portfolio were global generic competition for Jackson and the War in Ukraine. China swine products again declined due to lower pork prices and COVID-related lock downs. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also continues to be challenged by generics and cheaper alternatives to Zoetis. Meanwhile, our fish portfolio again grew double digits in the quarter. And along with the strength of our sheep products in Australia, partially offset the broader decline. Overall, livestock performance in the quarter continues to be in line with our expectations.  Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.1 billion in the quarter, growing 9% with companion animal products growing 13% and livestock sales declining 7%. Focusing first on companion animal. U.S. set practice revenue trends continue to be positive with practice revenue growing approximately 5%. Spending per visit remained strong again this quarter, increasing over 7%. Visit declined more than 2%, primarily due to challenging prior year comparisons. In terms of best visit traffic, it is worth noting that business in the second quarter were above the number of visits pre-COVID in the second quarter of 2019 and the trend line for growth in visits over the last several years continues to slow favorably. I would also like to point out that our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. had volume growth of 8% in the quarter. Our injectable portfolio of products that must be administered in the vet clinic also saw volume growth in the quarter. These products include Cytopoint, vaccines and Poulvac. Underlying demand for veterinary care remains robust throughout the country even as people return to work. While labor challenges do exist as they do across most industries, we believe vet clinic revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth of 13% in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from Simparica Trio as well as key dermatology products.  Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $208 million in the U.S., growing 74%. We are pleased to see that a significant number of Trio customers are new to the flea, tick and heartworm category altogether. In addition, we continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics. These dynamics will provide additional runway for future expansion of both the broader market and revenue growth for Trio. Key dermatology product sales were $219 million for the quarter, growing 11% with Apoquel and Cytopoint is significantly contributing to growth. Year-to-date, our derm portfolio grew 16%. Our investments to support our derm portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dogs with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. U.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by sales of cattle products as a result of generic competition for Jackson. Meanwhile, our poultry portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix. Swine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of increased disease prevalence and favorable market conditions for producers. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 2% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 16% operationally and loss lag revenue grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, our key dermatology products and the Simparica franchise. These core brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer promotional campaigns and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain with Librela generating $26 million in Solensia delivering $5 million in second quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, Librela is the number one pain product in the EU with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain high. Compliance continues to exceed our initial expectations, and we continue to see significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. It is also worth noting that we are observing similar pet owner and vet clinic trends in many of our key international markets that we are seeing in the U.S. The higher standard of care and better demographics as well as a more rapid adoption of innovation continues to expand markets for our products and we expect these trends to continue. Volume growth in our international and companion animal portfolio was 10% in the second quarter, and we also saw growth across our injectable products, including monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and Cytopoint. Meanwhile, international livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter with solid growth across fish, cattle and sheep. Our fish portfolio experienced increased demand for vaccines in key standard markets, including Chile and Norway. Cattle grew through favorable market conditions and price in key emerging markets, including Australia, Turkey, China and the U.K. Sales of sheep products grew as a result of favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia. Growth was partially offset by continued weakness with the price of pork and COVID-related supply challenges in China as well as unfavorable producer rotational programs with MFAs in Europe and reduced stock sizes in Latin America impacting poultry. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 69.8% decreased 120 basis points on a comparable basis to the prior year, resulting primarily from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts as well as higher manufacturing, freight and other costs partially offset by favorable price and mix. Adjusted operating expense increased 10% operationally with SG&A growth of 8% operationally, driven by promotional and marketing expenses related to key brands and new product launches as well as T&E cost beginning to return to pre-COVID levels. R&D expenses increased 16% operationally due to higher compensation costs, increased spending on projects and higher operating costs. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.7%, an increase of 70 basis points, driven by changes in jurisdictional mix of earnings and lower discrete tax benefits related to share-based payments. And finally, adjusted net income grew 9% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $146 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the back half of 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $600 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased only $450 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest share repurchase ever. Now moving on to our updated guidance for the full year 2022. For operational revenue growth, we are maintaining the midpoint and narrowing the range of growth to 9.5% to 10.5%, previously 9% to 11%. We are increasing our operational growth expectations for adjusted net income to a range of 11% to 13%, previously 10% to 13%. This change in guidance signals increased confidence in the back half of the year due to the continuing outperformance of companion animal, easing of certain supply constraints and an improvement in our business in China. Please note that our guidance for adjusted interest expense and/or ID was changed to reflect favorable changes to interest income. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance as of late July and reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022 due to the narrowing of our range and the impact of foreign exchange, we are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.325 billion. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.97 to $5.05 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.75. While guidance possess our outlook for the full year due to the unique factors impacting our business in 2022, I would like to note that our guidance for growth, especially for revenue and adjusted net income will be rated towards the end of the year. While we expect operating expenses to be incurred at a similar rate across that half of the year, we are noting an easier OpEx pop in Q4 than Q3 due to heavy spending in the fourth quarter of last year. Also, in Q3 of last year, we experienced an unusually low adjusted effective tax rate of 16.7% due to favorability related to foreign-derived intangible income and certain discrete items. We do not expect similar favorability this year. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster in the market. and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long term. Our success will continue to come from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, productive innovation, and an infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We expect to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? And Mike, your question on margins and OpEx. If you look at our gross margins on a year-to-date basis, if you take out the impact of FX, we're running about 20 basis points above last year. So in the quarter, you saw gross margins down about 120 basis points, but it's all FX driven. We've effectively maintained OpEx growth range in our guidance, and we're able to raise the bottom line guidance to 11% to 13% versus 10% to 13% that we started the year with. So again, FX is having an impact here but we are executing into our plan, and we'll see an improvement even on the bottom line growth rate. Yes, Erin, with respect to our guidance and how you should be thinking about companion animal versus livestock. And so far year-to-date, we've delivered 9% operational growth at the top line, losses driven by companion animal. I think you can expect that to continue in the back half of the year when you consider, as Kristin just mentioned, Solensia will be fully launched in the second half in the U.S. here, we'll continue to see growth in Trio and with Librela, which we expect to be a blockbuster in the EU this year, we delivered $21 million in the first quarter, $26 million in the second quarter. So that will continue to ramp. So I think those will contribute towards comparing that will continue to drive. When I think about livestock, we do see easier comps in the back half than we would have had in the first half to recall swine in China, for example, prices start to really decline in the second half of last year. So that becomes a comp when you think about Q3 and Q4. And then for cattle, we did have some price adjustments in the fourth quarter last year on Jackson leading into the start of the year. So those make for a slightly easier comp from a cattle perspective in the fourth quarter. So those are sort of the considerations, but I would expect the second half to look more like the first half in terms of the contribution from companion animal compared to livestock. Yes. When you look at livestock, historically, we've seen livestock grow around the 4% range. Certainly, you're very familiar with what's happened in the last few years in terms of ASF and for us, with generic competition with Jackson and Zoamix, the year is essentially executing as we expected on livestock. We continue to believe that we can see livestock returning to normalized growth in the 2023-2024 time frame. And long term, when you look at livestock, we continue to see growth in this business long term, given population growth. We see urbanization as well as growing middle class, particularly as you look across emerging markets. And even this year, if you look at this quarter, for example, livestock grew 2% internationally, despite the headwinds in swine as I said, those comps get easier in the back half. And if you Russia-Ukraine, for example, another point there. So we're seeing growth in emerging markets on livestock. We expect those to continue in long term with innovation as well as we continue our swine vaccines that we are launching vector vaccines on the poultry side, immunotherapies [Indiscernible], et cetera, we would expect to continue to drive growth in livestock long term. Yes. Sure, I'd be happy to do that. Look, I think as we entered the year, we expected given the second year of generic competition for Jackson, our largest product in cattle and to some extent, in swine as well. We expected that to drag our livestock performance in the U.S. And again, that's essentially executing as we thought. What that is masking somewhat is the innovation that we are launching in swine for example, with vaccines in swine or vector vaccines that we have been launching will continue to drive in livestock as well. But we are seeing growth in emerging markets. You saw 2% growth in the quarter. But again, that was offset partially with Russia-Ukraine impact here given the conflict there, as well as swine, as you know, from the second half of last year, we've seen a decrease in price that has impacted the performance there, although we have seen a lift in price on swine over the last number of weeks or months in China, we expect to continue as we execute through the second half of the year. Well, I think certainly, when we look at price and demand, we've continued to see opportunistic price at or above inflation, and we've demonstrated that over the years, particularly in certain markets. We've also looked at data in terms of pet ownership and demographically, we see the structural improvement, I would say, even compared to a very strong basis to begin with. So if you look at pet ownership with respect to Gen Z and millennials, and they're prioritizing pet health that certainly bodes well. But also, we're seeing more adoption at higher income households if you look at what adoption numbers look like over the last number of years, which again is structurally very positive for the industry. So as we've taken price over the years and we took about 5% price on -- in companion animal this year. Overall for the company, we've been running about 3% net given some of the last slight dynamics of the Jackson generic competition. But we haven't been able to take price. And yet we still continue to see strong volume growth across the business. And to Kristin's point, that's largely driven as well by innovation in the space. So we continue to see elasticity in terms of ability to take price see from an inflationary perspective. Yes. When we look at the category, we speaking, clearly, Trio grew 72% in the quarter. If you look at our overall Simparica franchise, grew 47%, right? So if you get Simparica, not Trio, but Simparica internationally, it grew 23% in the quarter. So we have the broadest offering into the parasiticides in the industry. And clearly, the only triple combination in the U.S. What we are seeing is, categorically, we're seeing a shift from topicals and collars to all medications. And if you look at triple combination in the U.S. One of the interesting statistics that we've seen is that on Trio, about 30% of the dogs that are coming on Trio are new to the category and not having been prescribed a prescription of parasiticide in the prior 18 months or so. So we do see significant room to continue to expand in this space. And as competitors come into the space, there'll be more DTC that will drive even more patients for the clinic, which is beneficial for us as well given our relationships across corporate accounts and so on will benefit from having more voices out driving more patients into the clinic. So we're not seeing a slowdown in the category. There is a bit of a shift from the topicals and collars into rolls and that benefits us given our premium products. Yes, sure. If you look at Draxxin, right, the largest product that we have across our livestock portfolio. Beyond that, there isn't any other product that's even nearly that size and magnitude if you look across our portfolio as well in companion animals, there or products that are anywhere near any sort of LOE. So we would not anticipate after the first two years, that the generic competition element will be the key driver here in the business. As we said, we expect lifestyle to be returning back to sort of normalized growth in the '23-'24 time frame is what we would expect in that regard to a generic standpoint."

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call for 2022. Zoetis delivered a strong quarter to start the year with 9% operational revenue growth and 8% operational growth in adjusted net income driven by the strength of our companion animal portfolio. We generated similar growth for both the U.S. and international segments, with 9% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Our strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies and diagnostics are all capitalizing on the marriage of positive trends in pet care with customer-driven science coming from Zoetis. In the first quarter, we grew 20% operationally in our companion animal portfolio. As we expected, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 6% operationally in the quarter largely due to declines in swine product sales in China and generic competition from DRAXXIN. As we look at the rest of the year, we are updating our guidance to reflect the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates, but this has no impact on our previous operational growth rates and assumptions for the year, even as we face uncertainties related to the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns, inflation and ongoing supply chain constraints, we remain confident in the underlying strength and performance of our business. Our diverse portfolio, global scale, talented colleagues and continuous innovations remain the foundation of our long-term success and durability, and we continue to invest in the resources, marketing programs and manufacturing capacity we need to support our growth. In R&D, we're building new capabilities and pipeline across our companion animal and livestock portfolios to ensure our long-term performance. In the first quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products and indications, develop life cycle innovations for major brands and expand our portfolio into new markets. On the livestock side of the business, we expanded our cattle vaccine portfolio with an approval in the U.S. of Protiviti, the first modified live vaccine to offer protection against mycoplasma Bovis. This vaccine provides cattle producers and veterinarians with broader overall protection against bovine respiratory disease. We also gained approval in Brazil for Draxxin KP, which is also a treatment for BRD and combines the antimicrobial properties of DRAXXIN with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ketoprofen to rapidly reduce fever in a single dose. Draxxin KP is also approved in the U.S., Canada and European Union, Australia and Mexico, and it has been an important part of how we continue to distinguish the DRAXXIN brand in the face of generic competition. In poultry, we received approval in Brazil for Poulvac\u00ae Procerta\u2122 HVT-IBD, our recombinant vector vaccine that is also approved in the U.S. and Canada. On the companion animal side of the business, we received another approval for Solensia, the industry's first monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis pain in cats, adding Australia to the U.S., European Union, U.K., Canada and Switzerland and another mAb therapy, Cytopoint, received a claim extension in Canada so it now covers both the treatment of atopic dermatitis and allergic dermatitis in dogs. Cytopoint and Apoquel continue to grow significantly and expand the dermatology market as disease awareness and treatment options become more known to pet owners. We have a strong leadership position based on our innovative science and do not believe competing products will come to market in 2022. We also continue building our multipurpose diagnostics platform, Vetscan images with the recent addition of blood smear testing. Introduced in September 2020, Vetscan images is a first-of-its-kind technology with a multitude of applications, including AI fecal analysis, digital cytology image transfer and now AI Blood smear, all helping veterinarians broaden their in-clinic diagnostic offerings to provide the best care possible for dogs and cats. For the last two years, I've been speaking to you about our catalyst for growth, and those continue to drive our performance. Our outlook for growth in international markets remains very positive based on a diverse global footprint and continued expansion opportunities for key brands like Simparica Trio, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia. In terms of Ukraine, we have condemned the Russian invasion from the outside, and we are deeply saddened by the senseless violence being brought upon the people of Ukraine. Our company, colleagues and the Zoetis Foundation have worked together to provide veterinary care, medicines, financial support and evacuation assistance to those in need. With every decision, even the most difficult and complex ones, we're guided by our purpose to nurture the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. While we have suspended all investments and promotional activities in Russia, the continued care of pets and livestock remains an essential responsibility for Zoetis and our colleagues, and we remain focused on maintaining a critical supply of animal medicines and vaccines for veterinarians and producers there. We anticipate a negative impact of about 1% to our original full year growth expectations due to Ukraine and Russia, but we are maintaining our previous operational growth rates based on the overall strength of our companion animal business and the positive momentum of expanding our U.S. pet care and diagnostic commercial teams. Speaking of Diagnostics, another catalyst for growth, we delivered 12% operational growth in the first quarter. We continue to invest significantly in this space to accelerate our growth. For example, we've been shifting our go-to-market model this year and building a dedicated field force for our diagnostics portfolio. This hiring is a significant part of a 40% increase to our total U.S. companion animal field force. We see field force expansion as a key lever to supporting growth opportunities in our diagnostics and pet care businesses. We also continue to see very strong growth in pet care as we expand our major companion animal brands in markets around the world. Simperica Trio is doing very well as it continues to gain market share based on veterinarians preference for an innovative triple combination parasiticide for dogs. Pet owners have also been demonstrating strong loyalty rates after trying Trio, and we are excited by the ability of our direct-to-consumer campaigns and additional field force colleagues to increase interest in this product. Librela is also doing incredibly well across Europe, and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. As we see improvements in supply, we will be launching Solensia in additional markets such as Canada and Australia this year. In terms of the U.S., we are still planning a launch of Solensia in the second half of the year, and we anticipate approval for Librela by the end of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside of the U.S. Overall, we continue to benefit from pet care trends in terms of increased demand, clinic revenues, pet ownership and spending habits. Finally, a brief update on supply. As I mentioned last quarter, we are managing certain isolated supply constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products as we compete for some limited manufacturing inputs critical to human health during the pandemic. We were also seeing additional global supply challenges related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent COVID-19 resurgence in China. While some of these challenges are Global manufacturing and supply network to mitigate any impact to our overall business. And our commercial teams are ensuring control launches for new products and coordinating with customers to minimize any impacts on their animal care. In conclusion, we are off to a good start for the year, and we're maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year. Our diverse and durable portfolio, global scale and pipeline of innovations have us well positioned to meet customer needs and shareholder expectations for this year and beyond. Thank you. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny.\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year with continued growth across a number of our core product franchises. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $625 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is on price and 6% from volume. Volume growth of 6% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and Librela, 3% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 2%. The decline in other in-line products was expected and largely the result of a difficult comparison to the prior year and the impact of our swine business in China. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 20% operationally with livestock declining 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, where our innovative and diverse fleas, tick and heartworm portfolio drove growth of 25% operationally. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $164 million, representing operational growth of 83% versus the comparable 2021 period. In Q1, Simparica Trio was the number one canine parasiticide sold in the U.S. in terms of revenue, and we recently launched Trio in Japan, a sizable international heartworm market. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had significant global growth again with $307 million of revenue, representing 28% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 24% in the first quarter. In Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody Librela, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference grew 24% in the first quarter. In Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody, umbrella, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference lab. I think revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from our parasiticide portfolio as well as key dermatology products. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $147 million in the U.S., growing 77%. We continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics with additional runway for future revenue growth. Federal on and satisfaction material is approximately 90% key dermatology products sales were $194 million for the quarter, growing 23% with APOQUEL and Capon each significantly contributing to growth. Our investment to support the portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic, and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dolls with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. In an effort to support all of our long-term sustainable sources of growth in our companion animal portfolio. In April, we launched our new pet care go-to-market strategy, expanding our U.S. companion animal field force by approximately 40% and creating dedicated and separate diagnostic and pharma coverage for our portfolio of products. U.S. livestock declined 11% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business. This was expected as we experienced challenges from generic competition for Jackson, which didn't exist in the same quarter last year as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Meanwhile, upholstery business continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives resulting from reduced disease pressure from smaller foxises as well as generic competition for Zoamix. Swine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of favorable market conditions for producers and higher disease equivalence. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally, and livestock revenue declined 3% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from the growth of our key dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of ore pain and our parasite portfolio. Semak brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe, and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibody for OA pain with Librela generating $21 million and Cerencia delivering $3 million in first quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year. As we mentioned last quarter, Librela became the number one pain product in the EU in the first year of launch, with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain at around 90%. Compliance exceeded our initial expectations, and we'll continue a significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. This decline was driven predominantly by our swine portfolio in China. As we indicated over the past several months, increased port supply in the market like to a significant decline in pork prices, which impacts producer profitability. In addition, our first quarter of 2021 presented a difficult comparative period as pricing and producer profitability in that quarter had been at an all-time high. While we expect China to return to growth in the back half of the year, we anticipate a challenging second quarter for our swine portfolio. Partially offsetting our decline in swine was growth in our fish, poultry and cattle portfolios. Our fish portfolio grew double digits again this quarter, driven by growth of the AlphafluxCLIce treatment product and AlphaGeLivVac vaccine for SRS in Chile. Sales of cattle products grew in key markets due to favorable market conditions and pricing in Brazil and Australia as well as demand generation efforts in emerging markets such as Turkey and China. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 71.6% improved Advertising and promotion as well as direct-to-pet owner campaigns for key brands. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points, driven by the impact of favorable discrete tax items and settlements with certain tax authorities, slightly offset by changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 8% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $115 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We purchased approximately $361 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest dollar-based quarterly share repurchase ever. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2022. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late April and reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Please note that any update to our full year guidance are related directly and only to foreign exchange and that the ranges of our operational growth rates for revenue of 9% to 11% and adjusted income of 10% to 13% remained the same as our previous February guidance. We are holding these top and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%. and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.25 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%. For adjusted net income for the year -- adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.365 billion to $2.4 billion, while maintaining our expected operational growth of 10% to 13%. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.99 to $5.09 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.77. Sales of companion animal products will be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse prior silicide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and growth in point-of-care diagnostics. We also continue to see a very favorable global companion animal backdrop for 2022. For livestock, the fundamental macro trends, which make animal protein on essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023. While our guidance represents our expectations for the full year, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth for the remainder of 2022. We expect top line operational growth for Q2 to be slightly below Q1 as today business and certain supply chain activities. We also expect a similar foreign exchange impact in Q2 that we experienced in Q1, where reported revenue was negatively impacted by about 3%. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support future revenue growth, including field force expansion in the U.S. and incremental DTC advertising will drive OpEx growth in Q2 at a faster rate than revenue, impacting Q2 bottom line profitability more materially than in the back half of the year. We expect that foreign exchange in Q2 will have a negative impact to the bottom line of about 5%. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Our success is derived from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, and agile and disciplined innovation engine and our infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We extract to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great. I have one on companion animal trends that I have to ask here. What are you seeing at the clinic level if you could parse out a little bit more of what you're seeing across the U.S. and international in terms of demand trends, what you're seeing in terms of capacity constraints at the vet clinic level? And what is implied in your guidance at this point in terms of operational growth across the companion animal segment? And then a follow-up on Trio, I guess, where do you stand now in terms of market share in canine parasiticide at this point? And how much do you think Simparica Trio is taking share versus expanding the market with greater compliance?\nKristin Peck: Okay, Erin, it's Kristin. Great to hear from you. So we fundamentally and structurally believe the pet care industry is in great shape. I think as you've seen some of these trends over the last few years, there's a very high standard of care. The demographics of who is adopting these pets over the last few years being millennials, the number of pets you have out there and honestly, the aging of pets. So we do not think there is a demand problem. I think you saw in the quarter potentially a difficult cost to what you saw last year. If you look overall, a 5% increase at the vet clinic, there is a little bit less traffic, as you referenced. I think those are some of the shorter-term capacity constraints. But remember, we've got a lot more pets. So you're really -- the base is much larger than it's historically been. But given Omicron, there was definitely some challenges at some of the vet clinics. But the other thing to consider about the data that we would just highlight is that it really pulls out a lot of the large corporates who have found more innovative ways to structure their business to add more capacity. And I think you'll see more of that coming overall. There were the short-term labor shortages. The other thing to really focus on, we would say is if you look at Zoetis' business, it's a little different, the nature of our business and our innovation, we have a lot of chronic medications. It doesn't require tons of visits. So we focus a little bit more on the spend per visit as we look at it. We also have alternative channels, which for us in the quarter grew 34%. So we remain very optimistic with regards to pet care trends overall? And maybe, Wetteny, you can take her second question on Simparica.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Sure, Erin. Look, very, very pleased with the performance of Simparica Trio posting $164 million of revenue in the quarter, up 83%, became the number one canine parasiticide in the U.S. And as we've shared before, we have 90% penetration across large corporate accounts, et cetera. And within those penetrated clinics, we continue to take share as well. Satisfaction level with our product is about 90% among pet owners, and we also just launched Simparica Trio in Japan, which is a key heartworm market as well, just in the middle of this quarter. So I'm very pleased with the performance with Trio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Rains, William Blair.\nChristine Rains: I was just wondering if I could have any update on diagnostics contribution to the quarter and overall performance? Is growth tracking with your expectations? And can you comment on system placements versus testing volume growth. And if you would have made any additional reference lab purchases?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. I'll take this, Christine. Thanks for the question. Look, I'm very pleased with the performance of our Diagnostics business in the quarter. We grew 12%, posting $98 million of revenue. We really saw strong growth across both U.S. and international, both replacements as well as consumables. So we're very pleased with the performance of the business. In terms of reference lab acquisitions, we did not have any in the quarter. Obviously, we made a number of acquisitions that we -- in the U.S. and continue to make investments across technology. You might have seen images, for example, we've added additional indications here with blood smear in addition to fecal and digital psychology. So we continue to be very pleased with the performance of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Congratulations on the quarter. Just curious what has been the impact of inflation on your Animal Health business, both companion and livestock and how do you see potential increase in inflation or continued inflation impacting your business going forward?\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Louise. I'll start and then I'll move it to Wetteny. We've seen historically that pet owner spending has been incredibly durable right now, we've got about 63% of our revenue in companion animal. But if you look at the February research, 86% of pet owners would spend whatever it takes. So we do see inflation, and Wetteny can certainly get into how we've taken price, et cetera. But I think we've obviously seen increase in labor cost and freight and fuel. But Wetteny can really talk about the fact that we've been able to leverage price especially in our companion animal business. So Wetteny, do you want to go over some of those numbers?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Given we continue to see very strong underlying demand from pet owners, we have very innovative products across our portfolio. We've been able to demonstrate that we can take price at or above inflation levels in the past, and we don't see any reason why we won't do that now. If you look at this quarter, for example, our total growth included 3% of price. Now if you parse that out and you look at just companion animal globally, we took 6% of price. And so we'll continue to use that lever as we proceed. But given the dynamics, Kristin just mentioned, underlying strength in the market, we'll continue to have that availability to us.\nKristin Peck: And the only thing I'd add there is, despite inflation, I would just note that in 2021, we increased our margins and our guidance for 2022 does the same. So I think it really shows the durability and resilience of our industry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Kristin, I'd be curious to get your view following up on the commentary you have on just vet visit trends and vet spending trends. Do you see more variability in sales for your products that are administered need to be administered by the vet? And can you just remind us how big of a percentage of your companion animal business that is? And then a quick follow-up for Wetteny. It looks like the revenue guidance came down by $100 million. It looks like operating profit may be down by $50 million. So it seems like a high decremental margin on the revenue reduction. I guess does that just reflect kind of the composition of the expense base? Just to be curious kind of any color you can shed on that dynamic. Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I mean, I'll start off with your first question. Again, if you look at our overall portfolio and the nature of our business, I think the level of innovation, we're not as susceptible to vet visit trends. You basically what percentage has to be administered in the vet clinic. I don't know maybe around 50% that would be vaccines injectables. But I think if you look at the sales of Librela being now the number one pain product in Europe, clearly, for things that are really important to pet owners, they are getting into the clinic. Regular checks for vaccines, we're not seeing any significantly negative trends there. So I think chronic medications, which is a huge part of our business. And if you look at dermatology and parasiticides, which are growing at pairs are growing at 25% in the quarter, derm at 28% in the quarter. We're clearly not really suffering from the slight decline in the U.S. in trends. But Wetteny, you can take that second question.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. As we've said, we've revised our guidance solely to reflect FX. We continue to maintain our operational guidance range, both top and bottom for the company that we came into in February that we gave. So from an FX perspective, top line impact is about 3%. It's about $260 million of an impact. And as you referenced, the change you're reflecting the change in FX has a wider impact on the bottom, and that's really largely driven by FX in losses given our exposure across certain currencies, particularly the euro. If you look at the first quarter, for example, you see a wider impact at the bottom that you see at the top, driven by the impact of that as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Congrats on a strong result. I want to start with livestock markets. I mean we've known livestock was going to be weak for a while, and so it's not a huge surprise. But so I just want to get an update on how you're seeing a couple of factors that are going, both DRAXXIN, are you still sort of projecting lapping the tough comps around the summer and sort of what are your expectations for DRAXXIN exiting this year and next year, and then broader conditions such as drought in the Midwest and the United States, rising input costs. Sort of how do you see that playing out for U.S. livestock and internationally? And then a follow-up question for Wetteny, if I might. You guys touched a number of times in the prepared remarks on field force expansions or investing in growth, investing in the opportunities in companion animal. Just wondering if you could go into a little more detail on how that's going to play out? When do you see that shown up in the numbers when you think you'll start seeing the payoff for that? And just sort of talk about labor pressures, wage pressures, how that affects your thought process there?\nKristin Peck: Great. Mike, I'll take the first part of it, which is the broader livestock trends and then Wetteny can take the DRAXXIN and the field force question that you've got. I mean, look, as you know, well, historically, livestock has grown around 4% I think if you look at 2019 and 2020, you saw sort of some unusual events that affected overall industry livestock growth. Obviously, African Swine Fever in China, as you remember, and then overall COVID, but then as I think as you look at 2021 and 2022, Zoetis has been unusually impacted and that has everything to do with where DRAXXIN is. And Wetteny can get into the numbers, but that has played out exactly how we expected it to. Our long-term outlook, as Wetteny mentioned a few minutes ago in his prepared remarks, remains unchanged. We think you're going to start to go back to more normalized growth in 2023 and beyond, basically because feeding the world is a powerful trend, the desire for protein and higher quality protein. But let me let Wetteny get into some of the specifics on the DRAXXIN numbers and then your second question.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So as we said from the very beginning with the cycle DRAXXIN, we expect it to have about a 20% impact to the top line in the first year and another 20% in the second. So what we're seeing across livestock right now is playing out exactly as we thought. In fact, in 2021, we did a little bit slightly better than that with respect to DRAXXIN. And we continue to have the effects -- positive effects of life cycle innovation like Draxxin KP, and we're maintaining most of our volume. And the margin for DRAXXIN remains very attractive for us as well. So as we expected, we've seen competitors come in, but the performance has been at or slightly better than we expected. Broadly speaking, I think if you look at swine, for example, in China, there was a pretty significant impact on the quarter with respect to large stock. Again, we expected that coming in. And it's really looking at where swine prices are in China versus a year ago, where they were at all-time highs and have been at all-time lows essentially here and the lockdowns having an impact on sort of demand consumption as well in this case. So with respect to the field force, if I can transition to that part of your question, very pleased to be able to expand our field force here. We have the broadest portfolio across the market. And if you look at innovation that we have coming as well with respect to the pain franchises for Solensia that we are probably launching across the second half of this year. And as we get approval for Librela and launched that as well in the U.S., we continue to have opportunities to really capitalize on the market dynamics and the strong demand and have additional field force, which we see a strong return on those as well. We're also launching a dedicated sale force for diagnostics, separate and apart from our Rx teams, which we believe will have, again, a very positive return for us as well. Now you can see that with those plans, we still have an operational levered P&L where we're growing the bottom line above the top line. So top line in 9% to 11% and the bottom at 10% to 13% with approximately a 40% increase in our field force.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel.\nJon Block: Great. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. For U.S. Librela approval, was that a slight push, Kristin, to year-end '22 for mid-'22? If it was, maybe just if you could elaborate on what still needs to get done there for approval? And if it is here in '22, how are you from a supply standpoint? Do you think that product will be ready for early 2023 U.S. launch? And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. Wetteny, can you talk about the supply chain and cost and how you feel there? Companion animals expected to be a big year-over-year in '22. So you've got this positive mix shift, you've got price running ahead of what it normally does. I think you called out 3% versus 1% last year. And GM still expected to be flattish. So you just would love some color on how you're feeling in the supply chain.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Jon. I'll start with the first question and let Wetteny take the second. With regard to Librela, no, this is exactly as we expected. We were expecting an approval later this year. We continue to expect that, as we wrote in the market, there's no change there. We still require an ex-U.S. site visit, as we said all along. So I would say there's really no update there. And to your second question, when would you expect a launch? We're obviously, as we would in any product working to build up supply. But as always, in our industry and especially with regards to biologics and monoclonal antibodies, the standard in our industry is it takes somewhere between three and 9 months to get up to a full launch. So is a monoclonal antibody. We'll do an early experience sometime in the first half, again, depending on when the approval is and launch shortly thereafter. We're quite excited about this. Obviously, we're working hard to build up that supply as soon as we get the approvals of the site, et cetera. So everything on Librela is exactly where we were before, really absolutely no change there.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. And I'll take the supply chain part of the question, Jon. Look, our supply chain has proven to be very resilient despite challenging elements over the last couple of years. We delivered 15% operational growth last year with 14 of that in volume. So we put an ability to continue to navigate through those. Currently, we are looking at China, for example, where the lockdowns have had an effect certainly in our first quarter, and we see that in our second quarter as well, which is why we included those in our prepared commentary around Q2 expectations. But in terms of price, we are pulling that leverage 3% total for the company. On the companion animal side, which now that's about 53% of our company if you look at the first quarter, companion animal has grown almost 60% over the last two years, if you look back to 2019 level. So again, very strong market dynamics and demand. We do see the mix shift being very positive for us with more companion animal and with our innovative products that are launching as well. But we do have some offsets when you look at livestock, particularly DRAXXIN, as we just talked about in line with our expectations, but certainly are giving price and maintaining the volume and, as I said, still at attractive margins for us. But that's really the main offset if you look at it across the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Balaji Prasad of Barclays.\nBalaji Prasad: One each on combined and livestock, firstly on atopic dermatitis. I estimate that you currently probably have around 35% of the market share in the U.S. between Cytopoint and Apoquel. With the -- what percent of the incremental market is allergic dermatitis and is this market open for you as you get the label extension. On the same subject, do you also have an update on your oral JAK inhibitors and which is expected to come later this year, how that would influence the market share at all? On the livestock side, could you quantify if there are any opportunities that are coming to you through the Chinese consumption shifting towards beef and poultry will be swine, are you there's not much of a trend there?\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start on the overall derm. As you saw, it grew about 28% in the quarter, driven by expanding our direct efforts. Certainly, you see we're investing more in our field force pet care rewards. I also think genuinely, it's just more people home with their pets. I don't have the specific share numbers. We can certainly get back to you on that I think it's over 70% in the U.S., our share of the atopic dermatitis, allergic dermatitis markets overall in the U.S. and especially it's even more if you want to look at revenue. But we're really pleased with where that's going. With regards to competition, I know our favorite question, we don't absolutely know. We would expect competition on it. At this point in time, as we look at 2022, we are not expecting competition in 2022, we would expect it in 2023. As our latest intelligence, obviously, we could be wrong there. But expectation is competition for derm on a small molecule basis will come in 2023. With regards to our own pipeline internally, we don't discuss that. So I don't think we have any color there. But I don't know, Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Just one thing to add on the first one. For us, really, when we look at Derm, it's less about market share, it's a lot more about market expansion. There's certainly an opportunity when we look at the number of dogs that suffer from each [indiscernible] are not being treated. About 6 million, and of the 7.6 million that are being created, so a good portion of them are undertreated with either antihistamines or steroids. So we do think there's an opportunity with respect to the under treatment there. Now I'll shift over to your question around livestock, particularly around China. We have seen an increase in beef consumption here, which certainly benefits us when you look at our business in Brazil, for example, that exports into China from a beef perspective as well as in China set of activities. And so it's still -- in terms of in China, it's still relatively small compared to swine, for example, but we are seeing good trends there that are favorable to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: First, can you just remind us about your sensitivity to economic growth? I know you're seeing very healthy demand in the companion side right now and you've been able to take price. But if we enter a mild recession in some parts of the world, particularly Europe, what type of pressures would you anticipate, if any, to your business from that? And my second one was on protein demand. I know you've touched on this in a couple of other questions, but it does seem like we're entering kind of a challenging macro environment with food prices growing very rapidly, especially in the emerging markets. Do you see that as a risk at all in terms of global protein demand consumers trading down on protein that could kind of dampen kind of your livestock recovery as we look out to kind of 2023 and beyond.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Chris. Good to hear from you. As you think about the economic challenges, potential economic risk across the globe, I think one thing you've seen about the animal health industry I was referencing before, the research is 86% will spend what it takes. And I think it's also really important to focus on the fact that our companion animal business is growing 50% between 2019 and 2021. As Wetteny mentioned, it was about 63%. And that is just a more durable business as you think about getting through economic challenges. We grew through the beginning of COVID, for example. As you look at it, we've grown during the Great Recession. And that was when our companion animal business was only 35%. So I think structurally, if you look at our business, it's more positive now than it was during the Great Recession, so I do think we're going to be pretty resilient as we go through those times. But I'll let Wetteny add anything wants to and then take your protein demand trend question.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, I think you've covered it well, just a companion animal. It's a bigger percentage of our business now is proving to be very resilient. And structurally with respect to demographics we have more Gen Z and millennials, owning pets, more pets. And if you look across our portfolio, a number of chronic conditions that we're treating that are very resilient even as we've seen in the past and structurally even stronger now. With respect to livestock, you do see the potential for people to trade down in proteins going from beef down to chicken or pork and then et cetera. So we do think that can happen in terms of looking across the globe. We do have a growth portfolio across different species, obviously. But that is one of the areas that we think is a little bit less than what we see in companion animal, where extremely resilient. Now we do, overall, though, when you look at protein consumption, we do see that growing over time, particularly as you could look across emerging markets, growing populations increase in sort of sole income, et cetera, and growing middle class across different markets. We see those continuing to maintain growth to protein consumption, we do have the pandemic, which actually has been negative from a lifestyle perspective. I think folks look at the pandemic and think about the positive effects on the companion animal side. but that has actually been largely negative. And so we do believe that they'll -- in addition to our DRAXXIN, which we've talked about, we do anticipate a return to growth in livestock as we get out into 2023, 2024 timeframe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala of Cowen.\nSteve Scala: You mentioned enhanced spending per pet. Our understanding is that this is due to two things, enhanced compliance and catch-up in routine wellness checks. Is that what you've seen? If so, how much does each contribute? So how much does enhanced compliance contribute versus catch-up in routine visits. The concern is that the catch-up in routine visits would seem like a onetime boost. And if that's the case, then what are the long-term implications of not -- no longer getting that boost and just enjoying the trends of the enhanced compliance?\nKristin Peck: Sure. I mean, I guess what we would say is that you're seeing more animals, you're seeing Wetteny's mentioned the demographics of who is adopting these animals, people who spend more time, more money on them, the aging of pets. So I'm not sure we would probably parse the data the way you do to be perfectly honest. Obviously, we are seeing increased compliance. I think alternative channels sort of online and autoship, even from clinics, is really helping driving that increased compliance. But I would say if you look at our portfolio, it's innovation. It's bringing disruptive innovation that people are excited about, looking at Paris, a single product that does three things. people are excited about. You look at monoclonal antibodies. You look at dermatology. We have great chronic medications that are not as susceptible to how many visits you make. If you get a prescription for par, it lasts the year. So I guess we would look at the data slightly differently than what you're looking at it. And more importantly, for our business, we think the nature of our business and the level of innovation and the demographics of both the number of animals and who's adopting them remains very positive.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. I would say it's a combination of just an increased standard of care for animals, particularly for pets that's aided by the innovation that's come out of Zoetis across derm and parasiticides and now with pain and the demographics of the owners that actually put a premium on the health of their pets that's driving this. And I think people are doing more in those visits as well, which is driving sort of the revenue per visit figures that you see, which is, again, part of the reason that we don't think the visits themselves are as meaningful as the spend per visit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elliott Wilbur of Raymond James.\nElliot Wilbur: One question around the EU launch experience and dynamics to date with respect to Librela and Solensia. Just how some of the early experience is shaping expectations for the U.S. launch areas of over underperformance where you've been positively surprised. And just thinking about dynamics such as persistence, do you have any sense of the number of patients started on therapy that are returning for follow-up injections, Librela share of new patient starts. And I know it's still relatively early, but is -- or are you seeing or are you expecting to see an increase in overall patient volumes from the launch of these products? And then just as a quick follow-up here, how important was -- or is the mAb opportunity in the U.S. in terms of driving your decision behind the sales force expansion?\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Elliot. Great questions on Librela. We are super excited at the launch there. To get to some of the specific information you have for us. As we said, this is now Librela in Europe is now the number one selling product for pain. What's really exciting also about that is 40% are patients that are new to the category. So I think this is really changing the game for a lot of people, maybe for safety reasons, couldn't take what the other products were are really coming into the vet clinic. And to get to your other question, there's a 90% reorder rate. So which gets that -- if you come in for one injection, are you staying with the product? The answer is yes. And this is why we believe in its first full year in Europe alone, Librela will be a blockbuster product for us. We did about $22 million in Q1. This definitely does inform as we think about U.S. launch. It informs why we want to start with early experience getting each of the best, especially the KOLs used to what it looks like. How to treat, how to manage it. And then really building that excitement which worked incredibly well for us in Europe which will do again in the U.S. And really I think our expectations for the product have increased based on the success we\u2019ve seen already. So Solensia, we are very excited as well. It's a very different market, it didn't exist before. As we talked about we're really creating the market as what is demonstrated time and again. It's ability to do that as it in derm. But again you got to get the cast to the clinic as you know there are less medicals lives than dogs. You've got to help cat owners know what pain looks like. But we remain super excited about Solensia. It will just be, as we said, the ramp will look slightly different on Solensia than it does with Librela. But we're just as excited, and we think it's potential is very strong there. Do you want to add anything, Wetteny?\nWetteny Joseph: No, just a part of the question on the field force, I wanted to just make a comment on, which is, look, we have the broadest portfolio, as I mentioned before. And we continue to add innovative products to that. And so we carefully analyze sort of the coverage across clinics and across products for our field force and are very confident that this is an investment that's going to have that's going to yield positive returns for us across our products, existing products, opportunities to expand in the existing products as well as new products that are coming on.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session at this time. I'd be happy to return the call to Kristin Peck, CEO, for any concluding remarks.\nKristin Peck: Great. Thank you all for your questions and for the continued interest in Zoetis. I just want to summarize, I think Zoetis is off to a strong start of the year. We've got continued strength in products for pet care, and I think as you've seen, a diverse and durable global portfolio, we're really happy to be maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year despite the negative impact of foreign exchange and other headwinds. And we're continuing to make ongoing investments in talent and technology, manufacturing expansions and innovation that have us well positioned to support our future growth plans as well. So I look forward to keeping you updated on future calls and hope you have a great day. Thanks so much, everybody.\nOperator: This does conclude today's Zoetis Q1 2022 earnings call and webcast. You may now disconnect, and everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter earnings call for 2022. Zoetis delivered a strong quarter to start the year with 9% operational revenue growth and 8% operational growth in adjusted net income driven by the strength of our companion animal portfolio. We generated similar growth for both the U.S. and international segments, with 9% and 8% operational growth, respectively. Our strength across parasiticides, dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies and diagnostics are all capitalizing on the marriage of positive trends in pet care with customer-driven science coming from Zoetis. In the first quarter, we grew 20% operationally in our companion animal portfolio. As we expected, our livestock portfolio continued to face challenges, declining 6% operationally in the quarter largely due to declines in swine product sales in China and generic competition from DRAXXIN. As we look at the rest of the year, we are updating our guidance to reflect the negative impact of recent changes in foreign exchange rates, but this has no impact on our previous operational growth rates and assumptions for the year, even as we face uncertainties related to the war in Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns, inflation and ongoing supply chain constraints, we remain confident in the underlying strength and performance of our business. Our diverse portfolio, global scale, talented colleagues and continuous innovations remain the foundation of our long-term success and durability, and we continue to invest in the resources, marketing programs and manufacturing capacity we need to support our growth. In R&D, we're building new capabilities and pipeline across our companion animal and livestock portfolios to ensure our long-term performance. In the first quarter, we continued to receive approvals for new products and indications, develop life cycle innovations for major brands and expand our portfolio into new markets. On the livestock side of the business, we expanded our cattle vaccine portfolio with an approval in the U.S. of Protiviti, the first modified live vaccine to offer protection against mycoplasma Bovis. This vaccine provides cattle producers and veterinarians with broader overall protection against bovine respiratory disease. We also gained approval in Brazil for Draxxin KP, which is also a treatment for BRD and combines the antimicrobial properties of DRAXXIN with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ketoprofen to rapidly reduce fever in a single dose. Draxxin KP is also approved in the U.S., Canada and European Union, Australia and Mexico, and it has been an important part of how we continue to distinguish the DRAXXIN brand in the face of generic competition. In poultry, we received approval in Brazil for Poulvac\u00ae ProcertaTM HVT-IBD, our recombinant vector vaccine that is also approved in the U.S. and Canada. On the companion animal side of the business, we received another approval for Solensia, the industry's first monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis pain in cats, adding Australia to the U.S., European Union, U.K., Canada and Switzerland and another mAb therapy, Cytopoint, received a claim extension in Canada so it now covers both the treatment of atopic dermatitis and allergic dermatitis in dogs. Cytopoint and Apoquel continue to grow significantly and expand the dermatology market as disease awareness and treatment options become more known to pet owners. We have a strong leadership position based on our innovative science and do not believe competing products will come to market in 2022. We also continue building our multipurpose diagnostics platform, Vetscan images with the recent addition of blood smear testing. Introduced in September 2020, Vetscan images is a first-of-its-kind technology with a multitude of applications, including AI fecal analysis, digital cytology image transfer and now AI Blood smear, all helping veterinarians broaden their in-clinic diagnostic offerings to provide the best care possible for dogs and cats. For the last two years, I've been speaking to you about our catalyst for growth, and those continue to drive our performance. Our outlook for growth in international markets remains very positive based on a diverse global footprint and continued expansion opportunities for key brands like Simparica Trio, Apoquel, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia. In terms of Ukraine, we have condemned the Russian invasion from the outside, and we are deeply saddened by the senseless violence being brought upon the people of Ukraine. Our company, colleagues and the Zoetis Foundation have worked together to provide veterinary care, medicines, financial support and evacuation assistance to those in need. With every decision, even the most difficult and complex ones, we're guided by our purpose to nurture the world and human kind by advancing care for animals. While we have suspended all investments and promotional activities in Russia, the continued care of pets and livestock remains an essential responsibility for Zoetis and our colleagues, and we remain focused on maintaining a critical supply of animal medicines and vaccines for veterinarians and producers there. We anticipate a negative impact of about 1% to our original full year growth expectations due to Ukraine and Russia, but we are maintaining our previous operational growth rates based on the overall strength of our companion animal business and the positive momentum of expanding our U.S. pet care and diagnostic commercial teams. Speaking of Diagnostics, another catalyst for growth, we delivered 12% operational growth in the first quarter. We continue to invest significantly in this space to accelerate our growth. For example, we've been shifting our go-to-market model this year and building a dedicated field force for our diagnostics portfolio. This hiring is a significant part of a 40% increase to our total U.S. companion animal field force. We see field force expansion as a key lever to supporting growth opportunities in our diagnostics and pet care businesses. We also continue to see very strong growth in pet care as we expand our major companion animal brands in markets around the world. Simperica Trio is doing very well as it continues to gain market share based on veterinarians preference for an innovative triple combination parasiticide for dogs. Pet owners have also been demonstrating strong loyalty rates after trying Trio, and we are excited by the ability of our direct-to-consumer campaigns and additional field force colleagues to increase interest in this product. Librela is also doing incredibly well across Europe, and we remain confident in the blockbuster potential for Librela in 2022 and Solensia in the longer term. As we see improvements in supply, we will be launching Solensia in additional markets such as Canada and Australia this year. In terms of the U.S., we are still planning a launch of Solensia in the second half of the year, and we anticipate approval for Librela by the end of the year, assuming FDA inspections are completed at facilities outside of the U.S. Overall, we continue to benefit from pet care trends in terms of increased demand, clinic revenues, pet ownership and spending habits. Finally, a brief update on supply. As I mentioned last quarter, we are managing certain isolated supply constraints for Librela, Solensia and some of our other products as we compete for some limited manufacturing inputs critical to human health during the pandemic. We were also seeing additional global supply challenges related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the recent COVID-19 resurgence in China. While some of these challenges are Global manufacturing and supply network to mitigate any impact to our overall business. And our commercial teams are ensuring control launches for new products and coordinating with customers to minimize any impacts on their animal care. In conclusion, we are off to a good start for the year, and we're maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year. Our diverse and durable portfolio, global scale and pipeline of innovations have us well positioned to meet customer needs and shareholder expectations for this year and beyond. Thank you. Now let me hand things off to Wetteny. Okay, Erin, it's Kristin. Great to hear from you. So we fundamentally and structurally believe the pet care industry is in great shape. I think as you've seen some of these trends over the last few years, there's a very high standard of care. The demographics of who is adopting these pets over the last few years being millennials, the number of pets you have out there and honestly, the aging of pets. So we do not think there is a demand problem. I think you saw in the quarter potentially a difficult cost to what you saw last year. If you look overall, a 5% increase at the vet clinic, there is a little bit less traffic, as you referenced. I think those are some of the shorter-term capacity constraints. But remember, we've got a lot more pets. So you're really -- the base is much larger than it's historically been. But given Omicron, there was definitely some challenges at some of the vet clinics. But the other thing to consider about the data that we would just highlight is that it really pulls out a lot of the large corporates who have found more innovative ways to structure their business to add more capacity. And I think you'll see more of that coming overall. There were the short-term labor shortages. The other thing to really focus on, we would say is if you look at Zoetis' business, it's a little different, the nature of our business and our innovation, we have a lot of chronic medications. It doesn't require tons of visits. So we focus a little bit more on the spend per visit as we look at it. We also have alternative channels, which for us in the quarter grew 34%. So we remain very optimistic with regards to pet care trends overall? And maybe, Wetteny, you can take her second question on Simparica. Thanks, Louise. I'll start and then I'll move it to Wetteny. We've seen historically that pet owner spending has been incredibly durable right now, we've got about 63% of our revenue in companion animal. But if you look at the February research, 86% of pet owners would spend whatever it takes. So we do see inflation, and Wetteny can certainly get into how we've taken price, et cetera. But I think we've obviously seen increase in labor cost and freight and fuel. But Wetteny can really talk about the fact that we've been able to leverage price especially in our companion animal business. So Wetteny, do you want to go over some of those numbers? And the only thing I'd add there is, despite inflation, I would just note that in 2021, we increased our margins and our guidance for 2022 does the same. So I think it really shows the durability and resilience of our industry. Sure. I mean, I'll start off with your first question. Again, if you look at our overall portfolio and the nature of our business, I think the level of innovation, we're not as susceptible to vet visit trends. You basically what percentage has to be administered in the vet clinic. I don't know maybe around 50% that would be vaccines injectables. But I think if you look at the sales of Librela being now the number one pain product in Europe, clearly, for things that are really important to pet owners, they are getting into the clinic. Regular checks for vaccines, we're not seeing any significantly negative trends there. So I think chronic medications, which is a huge part of our business. And if you look at dermatology and parasiticides, which are growing at pairs are growing at 25% in the quarter, derm at 28% in the quarter. We're clearly not really suffering from the slight decline in the U.S. in trends. But Wetteny, you can take that second question. Great. Mike, I'll take the first part of it, which is the broader livestock trends and then Wetteny can take the DRAXXIN and the field force question that you've got. I mean, look, as you know, well, historically, livestock has grown around 4% I think if you look at 2019 and 2020, you saw sort of some unusual events that affected overall industry livestock growth. Obviously, African Swine Fever in China, as you remember, and then overall COVID, but then as I think as you look at 2021 and 2022, Zoetis has been unusually impacted and that has everything to do with where DRAXXIN is. And Wetteny can get into the numbers, but that has played out exactly how we expected it to. Our long-term outlook, as Wetteny mentioned a few minutes ago in his prepared remarks, remains unchanged. We think you're going to start to go back to more normalized growth in 2023 and beyond, basically because feeding the world is a powerful trend, the desire for protein and higher quality protein. But let me let Wetteny get into some of the specifics on the DRAXXIN numbers and then your second question. Sure. Thanks, Jon. I'll start with the first question and let Wetteny take the second. With regard to Librela, no, this is exactly as we expected. We were expecting an approval later this year. We continue to expect that, as we wrote in the market, there's no change there. We still require an ex-U.S. site visit, as we said all along. So I would say there's really no update there. And to your second question, when would you expect a launch? We're obviously, as we would in any product working to build up supply. But as always, in our industry and especially with regards to biologics and monoclonal antibodies, the standard in our industry is it takes somewhere between three and 9 months to get up to a full launch. So is a monoclonal antibody. We'll do an early experience sometime in the first half, again, depending on when the approval is and launch shortly thereafter. We're quite excited about this. Obviously, we're working hard to build up that supply as soon as we get the approvals of the site, et cetera. So everything on Librela is exactly where we were before, really absolutely no change there. Sure. I'll start on the overall derm. As you saw, it grew about 28% in the quarter, driven by expanding our direct efforts. Certainly, you see we're investing more in our field force pet care rewards. I also think genuinely, it's just more people home with their pets. I don't have the specific share numbers. We can certainly get back to you on that I think it's over 70% in the U.S., our share of the atopic dermatitis, allergic dermatitis markets overall in the U.S. and especially it's even more if you want to look at revenue. But we're really pleased with where that's going. With regards to competition, I know our favorite question, we don't absolutely know. We would expect competition on it. At this point in time, as we look at 2022, we are not expecting competition in 2022, we would expect it in 2023. As our latest intelligence, obviously, we could be wrong there. But expectation is competition for derm on a small molecule basis will come in 2023. With regards to our own pipeline internally, we don't discuss that. So I don't think we have any color there. But I don't know, Wetteny, do you want to take the second question? Sure. Thanks, Chris. Good to hear from you. As you think about the economic challenges, potential economic risk across the globe, I think one thing you've seen about the animal health industry I was referencing before, the research is 86% will spend what it takes. And I think it's also really important to focus on the fact that our companion animal business is growing 50% between 2019 and 2021. As Wetteny mentioned, it was about 63%. And that is just a more durable business as you think about getting through economic challenges. We grew through the beginning of COVID, for example. As you look at it, we've grown during the Great Recession. And that was when our companion animal business was only 35%. So I think structurally, if you look at our business, it's more positive now than it was during the Great Recession, so I do think we're going to be pretty resilient as we go through those times. But I'll let Wetteny add anything wants to and then take your protein demand trend question. Sure. I mean, I guess what we would say is that you're seeing more animals, you're seeing Wetteny's mentioned the demographics of who is adopting these animals, people who spend more time, more money on them, the aging of pets. So I'm not sure we would probably parse the data the way you do to be perfectly honest. Obviously, we are seeing increased compliance. I think alternative channels sort of online and autoship, even from clinics, is really helping driving that increased compliance. But I would say if you look at our portfolio, it's innovation. It's bringing disruptive innovation that people are excited about, looking at Paris, a single product that does three things. people are excited about. You look at monoclonal antibodies. You look at dermatology. We have great chronic medications that are not as susceptible to how many visits you make. If you get a prescription for par, it lasts the year. So I guess we would look at the data slightly differently than what you're looking at it. And more importantly, for our business, we think the nature of our business and the level of innovation and the demographics of both the number of animals and who's adopting them remains very positive. Sure. Thanks, Elliot. Great questions on Librela. We are super excited at the launch there. To get to some of the specific information you have for us. As we said, this is now Librela in Europe is now the number one selling product for pain. What's really exciting also about that is 40% are patients that are new to the category. So I think this is really changing the game for a lot of people, maybe for safety reasons, couldn't take what the other products were are really coming into the vet clinic. And to get to your other question, there's a 90% reorder rate. So which gets that -- if you come in for one injection, are you staying with the product? The answer is yes.

This definitely does inform as we think about U.S. launch. It informs why we want to start with early experience getting each of the best, especially the KOLs used to what it looks like. How to treat, how to manage it. And then really building that excitement which worked incredibly well for us in Europe which will do again in the U.S. And really I think our expectations for the product have increased based on the success we've seen already. So Solensia, we are very excited as well. It's a very different market, it didn't exist before. As we talked about we're really creating the market as what is demonstrated time and again. It's ability to do that as it in derm. But again you got to get the cast to the clinic as you know there are less medicals lives than dogs. You've got to help cat owners know what pain looks like. But we remain super excited about Solensia. It will just be, as we said, the ramp will look slightly different on Solensia than it does with Librela. But we're just as excited, and we think it's potential is very strong there. Do you want to add anything, Wetteny? Great. Thank you all for your questions and for the continued interest in Zoetis. I just want to summarize, I think Zoetis is off to a strong start of the year. We've got continued strength in products for pet care, and I think as you've seen, a diverse and durable global portfolio, we're really happy to be maintaining our operational growth expectations for the full year despite the negative impact of foreign exchange and other headwinds. And we're continuing to make ongoing investments in talent and technology, manufacturing expansions and innovation that have us well positioned to support our future growth plans as well.

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a very strong start to the year with continued growth across a number of our core product franchises. Today, I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial performance, the key drivers contributing to our performance and provide an update on our full year 2022 guidance. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $625 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 3% is on price and 6% from volume. Volume growth of 6% consisted of 5% from new products, which includes Simparica Trio and Librela, 3% from key dermatology products, while other in-line products declined 2%. The decline in other in-line products was expected and largely the result of a difficult comparison to the prior year and the impact of our swine business in China. Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 20% operationally with livestock declining 6% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our small animal parasiticide portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, where our innovative and diverse fleas, tick and heartworm portfolio drove growth of 25% operationally. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $164 million, representing operational growth of 83% versus the comparable 2021 period. In Q1, Simparica Trio was the number one canine parasiticide sold in the U.S. in terms of revenue, and we recently launched Trio in Japan, a sizable international heartworm market. Meanwhile, our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, had significant global growth again with $307 million of revenue, representing 28% operational growth against a robust prior year in which key derm grew 24% in the first quarter. In Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody Librela, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference grew 24% in the first quarter. In Europe, our recently launched monoclonal antibody, umbrella, which is for osteoarthritis pain in dogs, also meaningfully contributed to growth in the quarter, posting $21 million in sales. Our Global Diagnostics portfolio recorded $98 million in revenue and had operational sales growth of 12% in Q1, growing across both our U.S. and international segments. Growth was largely driven globally by consumable usage and new products. We also continue to see growth in the placement of new devices in international markets. Diagnostics remains a key growth driver for Zoetis, and we continue to make significant investments in our field force, new technologies and reference lab. I think revenue will continue to grow at levels above what we were seeing prior to COVID as the standard of veterinary care continues to increase through innovation, better demographics, higher compliance and more pets. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven largely by sales from our parasiticide portfolio as well as key dermatology products. Growth of Simparica Trio was again strong in the quarter with sales of $147 million in the U.S., growing 77%. We continue to meet our clinic penetration targets and take share within individual clinics with additional runway for future revenue growth. Federal on and satisfaction material is approximately 90% key dermatology products sales were $194 million for the quarter, growing 23% with APOQUEL and Capon each significantly contributing to growth. Our investment to support the portfolio have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinic, and we will continue to invest meaningfully in this space as a large portion of dolls with dermatitis remain undertreated, representing an opportunity to further expand the market. In an effort to support all of our long-term sustainable sources of growth in our companion animal portfolio. In April, we launched our new pet care go-to-market strategy, expanding our U.S. companion animal field force by approximately 40% and creating dedicated and separate diagnostic and pharma coverage for our portfolio of products. U.S. livestock declined 11% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business. This was expected as we experienced challenges from generic competition for Jackson, which didn't exist in the same quarter last year as well as elevated input costs continuing to weigh on producer profitability. Meanwhile, upholstery business continues to be negatively impacted by the expanded use of lower cost alternatives resulting from reduced disease pressure from smaller foxises as well as generic competition for Zoamix. Swine products sales grew in the quarter as a result of favorable market conditions for producers and higher disease equivalence. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% operationally in the quarter. Companion animal revenue grew 23% operationally, and livestock revenue declined 3% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from the growth of our key dermatology products, monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of ore pain and our parasite portfolio. Semak brands continue to benefit from our international direct-to-consumer campaigns in Latin America and parts of Europe, and we remain excited with the long-term prospects of these programs. We are encouraged by the performance of our monoclonal antibody for OA pain with Librela generating $21 million and Cerencia delivering $3 million in first quarter sales. Librela remains on track to exceed $100 million in revenue this year. As we mentioned last quarter, Librela became the number one pain product in the EU in the first year of launch, with the underlying performance metrics being very favorable for future growth. Reordering rates remain at around 90%. Compliance exceeded our initial expectations, and we'll continue a significant opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. opportunity to expand the pain market with a meaningful percentage of dogs on Librela being new to the market. Meanwhile, international livestock declined 3% operationally in the quarter. This decline was driven predominantly by our swine portfolio in China. As we indicated over the past several months, increased port supply in the market like to a significant decline in pork prices, which impacts producer profitability. In addition, our first quarter of 2021 presented a difficult comparative period as pricing and producer profitability in that quarter had been at an all-time high. While we expect China to return to growth in the back half of the year, we anticipate a challenging second quarter for our swine portfolio. Partially offsetting our decline in swine was growth in our fish, poultry and cattle portfolios. Our fish portfolio grew double digits again this quarter, driven by growth of the AlphafluxCLIce treatment product and AlphaGeLivVac vaccine for SRS in Chile. Sales of cattle products grew in key markets due to favorable market conditions and pricing in Brazil and Australia as well as demand generation efforts in emerging markets such as Turkey and China. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 71.6% improved Advertising and promotion as well as direct-to-pet owner campaigns for key brands. R&D expenses increased 4% operationally due to higher compensation costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points, driven by the impact of favorable discrete tax items and settlements with certain tax authorities, slightly offset by changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings. And finally, adjusted net income grew 8% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 9% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $115 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year 2022, primarily related to investments in Ireland, the U.S. and China to support manufacturing capacity needed to meet our long-term growth demands. In the quarter, we returned over $0.5 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We purchased approximately $361 million of Zoetis shares, representing our largest dollar-based quarterly share repurchase ever. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2022. Foreign exchange rates on our updated guidance are as of late April and reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Please note that any update to our full year guidance are related directly and only to foreign exchange and that the ranges of our operational growth rates for revenue of 9% to 11% and adjusted income of 10% to 13% remained the same as our previous February guidance. We are holding these top and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.225 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%. and bottom line operational growth rates the same despite the conflict in Russia and Ukraine, negatively impacting our expected full year operational growth by 1%. We feel we can offset this impact with the strength of our companion animal portfolio. Beginning with revenue for the full year 2022, we are decreasing both the low and high end of the range by $100 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. We are now projecting revenue of between $8.25 billion and $8.375 billion while maintaining our expected operational growth of 9% to 11%. For adjusted net income for the year -- adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $2.365 billion to $2.4 billion, while maintaining our expected operational growth of 10% to 13%. And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.99 to $5.09 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.77. Sales of companion animal products will be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse prior silicide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain and growth in point-of-care diagnostics. We also continue to see a very favorable global companion animal backdrop for 2022. For livestock, the fundamental macro trends, which make animal protein on essential business remain intact, and we believe more normalized growth will occur in 2023. While our guidance represents our expectations for the full year, I would like to provide some color on the expected phasing of growth for the remainder of 2022. We expect top line operational growth for Q2 to be slightly below Q1 as today business and certain supply chain activities. We also expect a similar foreign exchange impact in Q2 that we experienced in Q1, where reported revenue was negatively impacted by about 3%. In addition, the significant investments we are making early in the year to support future revenue growth, including field force expansion in the U.S. and incremental DTC advertising will drive OpEx growth in Q2 at a faster rate than revenue, impacting Q2 bottom line profitability more materially than in the back half of the year. We expect that foreign exchange in Q2 will have a negative impact to the bottom line of about 5%. Our full year 2022 guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Our success is derived from our diversified portfolio of enduring brands driven by multiple sources of in-line growth, and agile and disciplined innovation engine and our infrastructure to develop and expand markets globally. We extract to continue to execute across multiple dimensions of our business and capitalize on favorable end market dynamics for the foreseeable future. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Yes. Sure, Erin. Look, very, very pleased with the performance of Simparica Trio posting $164 million of revenue in the quarter, up 83%, became the number one canine parasiticide in the U.S. And as we've shared before, we have 90% penetration across large corporate accounts, et cetera. And within those penetrated clinics, we continue to take share as well. Satisfaction level with our product is about 90% among pet owners, and we also just launched Simparica Trio in Japan, which is a key heartworm market as well, just in the middle of this quarter. So I'm very pleased with the performance with Trio. Yes, sure. I'll take this, Christine. Thanks for the question. Look, I'm very pleased with the performance of our Diagnostics business in the quarter. We grew 12%, posting $98 million of revenue. We really saw strong growth across both U.S. and international, both replacements as well as consumables. So we're very pleased with the performance of the business. In terms of reference lab acquisitions, we did not have any in the quarter. Obviously, we made a number of acquisitions that we -- in the U.S. and continue to make investments across technology. You might have seen images, for example, we've added additional indications here with blood smear in addition to fecal and digital psychology. So we continue to be very pleased with the performance of the business. Yes, sure. Given we continue to see very strong underlying demand from pet owners, we have very innovative products across our portfolio. We've been able to demonstrate that we can take price at or above inflation levels in the past, and we don't see any reason why we won't do that now. If you look at this quarter, for example, our total growth included 3% of price. Now if you parse that out and you look at just companion animal globally, we took 6% of price. And so we'll continue to use that lever as we proceed. But given the dynamics, Kristin just mentioned, underlying strength in the market, we'll continue to have that availability to us. Yes, sure. As we've said, we've revised our guidance solely to reflect FX. We continue to maintain our operational guidance range, both top and bottom for the company that we came into in February that we gave. So from an FX perspective, top line impact is about 3%. It's about $260 million of an impact. And as you referenced, the change you're reflecting the change in FX has a wider impact on the bottom, and that's really largely driven by FX in losses given our exposure across certain currencies, particularly the euro. If you look at the first quarter, for example, you see a wider impact at the bottom that you see at the top, driven by the impact of that as well. Yes. So as we said from the very beginning with the cycle DRAXXIN, we expect it to have about a 20% impact to the top line in the first year and another 20% in the second. So what we're seeing across livestock right now is playing out exactly as we thought. In fact, in 2021, we did a little bit slightly better than that with respect to DRAXXIN. And we continue to have the effects -- positive effects of life cycle innovation like Draxxin KP, and we're maintaining most of our volume. And the margin for DRAXXIN remains very attractive for us as well. So as we expected, we've seen competitors come in, but the performance has been at or slightly better than we expected. Broadly speaking, I think if you look at swine, for example, in China, there was a pretty significant impact on the quarter with respect to large stock. Again, we expected that coming in. And it's really looking at where swine prices are in China versus a year ago, where they were at all-time highs and have been at all-time lows essentially here and the lockdowns having an impact on sort of demand consumption as well in this case. So with respect to the field force, if I can transition to that part of your question, very pleased to be able to expand our field force here. We have the broadest portfolio across the market. And if you look at innovation that we have coming as well with respect to the pain franchises for Solensia that we are probably launching across the second half of this year. And as we get approval for Librela and launched that as well in the U.S., we continue to have opportunities to really capitalize on the market dynamics and the strong demand and have additional field force, which we see a strong return on those as well. We're also launching a dedicated sale force for diagnostics, separate and apart from our Rx teams, which we believe will have, again, a very positive return for us as well. Now you can see that with those plans, we still have an operational levered P&L where we're growing the bottom line above the top line. So top line in 9% to 11% and the bottom at 10% to 13% with approximately a 40% increase in our field force. Yes. And I'll take the supply chain part of the question, Jon. Look, our supply chain has proven to be very resilient despite challenging elements over the last couple of years. We delivered 15% operational growth last year with 14 of that in volume. So we put an ability to continue to navigate through those. Currently, we are looking at China, for example, where the lockdowns have had an effect certainly in our first quarter, and we see that in our second quarter as well, which is why we included those in our prepared commentary around Q2 expectations. But in terms of price, we are pulling that leverage 3% total for the company. On the companion animal side, which now that's about 53% of our company if you look at the first quarter, companion animal has grown almost 60% over the last two years, if you look back to 2019 level. So again, very strong market dynamics and demand. We do see the mix shift being very positive for us with more companion animal and with our innovative products that are launching as well. But we do have some offsets when you look at livestock, particularly DRAXXIN, as we just talked about in line with our expectations, but certainly are giving price and maintaining the volume and, as I said, still at attractive margins for us. But that's really the main offset if you look at it across the year. Yes, sure. Just one thing to add on the first one. For us, really, when we look at Derm, it's less about market share, it's a lot more about market expansion. There's certainly an opportunity when we look at the number of dogs that suffer from each [indiscernible] are not being treated. About 6 million, and of the 7.6 million that are being created, so a good portion of them are undertreated with either antihistamines or steroids. So we do think there's an opportunity with respect to the under treatment there. Now I'll shift over to your question around livestock, particularly around China. We have seen an increase in beef consumption here, which certainly benefits us when you look at our business in Brazil, for example, that exports into China from a beef perspective as well as in China set of activities. And so it's still -- in terms of in China, it's still relatively small compared to swine, for example, but we are seeing good trends there that are favorable to us. Yes, I think you've covered it well, just a companion animal. It's a bigger percentage of our business now is proving to be very resilient. And structurally with respect to demographics we have more Gen Z and millennials, owning pets, more pets. And if you look across our portfolio, a number of chronic conditions that we're treating that are very resilient even as we've seen in the past and structurally even stronger now. With respect to livestock, you do see the potential for people to trade down in proteins going from beef down to chicken or pork and then et cetera. So we do think that can happen in terms of looking across the globe. We do have a growth portfolio across different species, obviously. But that is one of the areas that we think is a little bit less than what we see in companion animal, where extremely resilient. Now we do, overall, though, when you look at protein consumption, we do see that growing over time, particularly as you could look across emerging markets, growing populations increase in sort of sole income, et cetera, and growing middle class across different markets. We see those continuing to maintain growth to protein consumption, we do have the pandemic, which actually has been negative from a lifestyle perspective. I think folks look at the pandemic and think about the positive effects on the companion animal side. but that has actually been largely negative. And so we do believe that they'll -- in addition to our DRAXXIN, which we've talked about, we do anticipate a return to growth in livestock as we get out into 2023, 2024 timeframe. Yes. I would say it's a combination of just an increased standard of care for animals, particularly for pets that's aided by the innovation that's come out of Zoetis across derm and parasiticides and now with pain and the demographics of the owners that actually put a premium on the health of their pets that's driving this. And I think people are doing more in those visits as well, which is driving sort of the revenue per visit figures that you see, which is, again, part of the reason that we don't think the visits themselves are as meaningful as the spend per visit. No, just a part of the question on the field force, I wanted to just make a comment on, which is, look, we have the broadest portfolio, as I mentioned before. And we continue to add innovative products to that. And so we carefully analyze sort of the coverage across clinics and across products for our field force and are very confident that this is an investment that's going to have that's going to yield positive returns for us across our products, existing products, opportunities to expand in the existing products as well as new products that are coming on."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be made available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the call via dial-in or on our Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, February 13, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% of the US and 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species, and therapeutic areas, has sustained our performance, further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation, from pioneering breakthroughs to product lifecycle enhancements, has solidified our position as the industry leader, consistently growing above the market and enables us to create market-leading franchises. We don't just follow trends, we make markets.  The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis, is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats, and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today Librela remains the number one selling OA pain product in Europe. At Investor Day last May, and again at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion, and we are excited about Librela's performance since its US launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth. Similarly, Solensia has also been well received, with strong clinic penetration around the world, with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain in cats.  Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians, and after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. Increasing pet owner's awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improved compliance, and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs, underpins our optimism. We remain confident that we can sustain growth thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticides portfolio, and particularly Simparica Trio, remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position, but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.  As we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world, and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges, while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance. Our dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility, outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024, and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally, which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chains, and commercial excellence, to cultivate new markets, drive growth, and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers, while performing above the market. Our focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities.  In closing, we'll continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As we look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world and humankind by advancing care for animals, and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition. I want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and we'll return excess capital to shareholders. While there is need and demand to improve the quality of life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision, to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues.  Thank you. Now, let me hand it over to Wetteny. Wetteny?\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023, with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range, while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange, as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad, with strong growth across both our US and international segments, both our companion animal and livestock portfolios, and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally, with adjusted net income anchoring 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia, as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.  On a segment basis, our US business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our international segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion, with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business, and represented a half a percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full-year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Our livestock portfolio also had a strong year, with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animal was led by OA pain mAbs, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets, as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the US. We continue to see penetration of our pain mAbs grow within vet clinics, and a high level of satisfaction amongst both vets and pet owners.  Our key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally, despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 7% operational, with growth contributions from both the US and international. Our livestock portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth, driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both a reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in US companion animal. Adjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both a reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is on volume. Volume growth consisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our inline products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter. On a segment basis, our US business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while our international segment reported revenue of $982 million, with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 6%. We saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our US and our international segments, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain mAbs were the primary driver of growth, posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 full launch of Librela in the US. Simparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth, driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally, as well as from increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the US and international. Our livestock products ended the year on a strong note, with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our US and international segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from drags in price decreases, as well as by volume, with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims. Now, moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9%, with companion animal sales growing 10%, and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by the full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, all while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier than normal pre-price buying at the end of last year. In the US, vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year, while we continue to see solid clinical revenue and revenue per visit, growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our US companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics, as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.  Moving on to product performance, growth in the US was driven by our pain mAbs, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain mAbs posted $58 million in US sales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the US early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in US sales in the quarter, which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain mAbs, there's a significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher than expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year, as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the US. We have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the US, feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted US sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%. Growth was driven primarily by price as we were in promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges, and in advance of a then expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter, with competition in the triple combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and the significant advantage of being first to market. (Indiscernible) dermatology product sales in the US were $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume, with vet and pet owners referring its injectable method of administration. (Operational) franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our US companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. US livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotations back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix, as well as share gain due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.  Moving on to our international segment where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally, and livestock grew 7% operationally. China represented a 3% drag on our international segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain mAbs, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio. Growth in our OA pain products was equally driven by sales force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launching European markets, as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million internationally or 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million in revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis. We continue to see benefit to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth in Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong parasiticide season, and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally, driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe, driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness. This growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022, as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing on to international livestock, which was 7% operationally, driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L, for the quarter adjusted gross margins of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which grew 10% operationally, primarily due to higher competition-related expenses, as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation. R&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses, as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net discrete tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the US related to foreign derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share purchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income.  Now, moving on to our guidance for the full year of 2024. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. At adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points, with significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX, so these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth, with growth across both price and volume. We expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the US launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our OA pain mAbs, both in the US and internationally. Our current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the US are exceeding our expectations, and as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrance, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. For livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets, as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we entered 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with livestock industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. For companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect US visits to grow flat to 1%, and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our OA pain products. For our companion animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio. We expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination of our parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In our key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower site utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase from 2023 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects, as well as higher compensation-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million. This is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the non-recurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023, as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted in income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $.584, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth. To summarize, 2023 was another strong year. Even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China, we again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future. As we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth, as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline, while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.  Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Right. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can you talk a little bit about the reorder rates and feedback and expectations around Librela for 2024 in the US and some of those stocking dynamics that we should think about quarter-to-quarter? And then a bigger picture question just on margins and profitability, and there are some moving factors in 2024, such as FX and the ramp up of Librela that weigh on margins, but can you talk a little bit more about the potential margin leverage that you could see across your business as you expand in some of those faster-growing and higher margin categories in 2025 and beyond? And if you could describe a little bit more about that longer term margin leverage. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yes, we were very pleased with how we did with Librela in the first full quarter of launch in Q4. As you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter, $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. Given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected, in line with our expectations. So, that makes us really confident as we go into the year. We're looking at what - your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clinics. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third, I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the number one selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the US as well. So, we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look, with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments, we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the US. So, I'll let Wetteny take the second question.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond. We do have Librela in 2023, as we said at Investor Day. If you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand, they started out as being dilutive to the overall company average. For example, in 2023. As we go into 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below what you would consider our innovative companion animal products. And as we exit 2024 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So, overall, beyond 2024, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect, but I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So, that mix will continue to be favorable for us. And as we get into the higher levels of production for monoclonal antibodies, they're also accretive to overall margins and we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So, all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them, investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023. And as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So, those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we'll position to continue to expand.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to touch on margins, maybe both for 2023 and 2024. So, it looks like you're guiding - back of the envelope math, you\u2019re guiding to about 100 bps of margin expansion in 2024, but you also did finish 2023 lower than we would've expected. I think 4Q especially came in significantly lower. And you called out some headwinds during the call in terms of FX. You called out some timing, some contribution to the Zoetis Charitable Foundation. Any way you could kind of back that out, give us sort of a cleaner number for what margins should have been in 2023, and then maybe what some of those one-time headwinds would have as an impact to 2024, just to give us a better sense of underlying margins and underlying EPS. And then my second question is just following up on Librela, I don't believe you actually quantified a target. So, I want to - just given what you did in 4Q, a major focus point, is something like $200 million to $250 million for Librela for 2024 reasonable? And especially - that's for US, but then on the O-US side, we've heard some concerns maybe coming out of Europe. And it seems like Librela has sort of been a little bit flat over the last couple of quarters in international markets. So, any color on what's going on internationally. Thanks.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure, Mike. Let take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So, take a look at margins. Indeed in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion and margins. Keep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact. And about 80 of that is from FX. So, you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now, looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our livestock team in Utah. And look, they've had a great year, and we expect livestock continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end. So, that created a little bit of a mix, and as well as outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit diluted. So, when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting 2023. Most of the impact here is coming from FX, about 80 basis points. The other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended, FX as I explained, the impact on our finish here, if you take a look at FX, which is clearly non-operational, and you factor non-recurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition, those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter, in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So, that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here. Of course, we don't forecast FX. So, what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024. And so, that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past. And I won\u2019t sit here and guess at what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024. that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes.  For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue, price is a pretty significant factor. We continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of two to three points, and perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And then Librela with the US launch clearly is going to be a significant factor. Certainly, $44 million in the quarter in Q4 was - again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So, you can model that out. In terms of what that would translate to, we're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far, as we discussed already. In international, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter, you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets, in addition to the US $44 million. So, I think what we have to really take into account here is, as we've been launching in markets in Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out and you just focus on those markets that were already launched, we're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters, about 50%, give or take growth. So, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets. Kristin?\nKristin Peck: No, it\u2019s great.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Wetteny, any revenue cadence in the year to call out? You've got sort of that easier 1Q 2023 comp, but you were also noting more acute China headwinds in the first half. So, just how do we think about it? Do we sort of look at it on a two-year stack basis? And then on the guidance for the full year, maybe GM fell a little bit below what we were thinking, but SG&A expense, despite the investments, Kristin, that you called out, the accelerated DTC, the SG&A was a little bit lower than where our heads were at. So, maybe you can just talk through those items, why we're only seeing, seems like low to mid-single digit SG&A growth year-over-year. I don't know if some of that's blunted by FX. And then just finally, I'm sorry, Librela, due to the stocking, do you still expect Librela to be up in the US 4Q 2023 to 1Q 2024 as it absorbs the stocking? Thanks, guys.\nWetteny Joseph: Look, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now, let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, Jon. If you look at Q1, certainly, if you look at companion animal in the US, there's an easier comp. We had destocking the first quarter last year, clearly something we look to see as an easier comp that we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so, I think if you look balance - those don't completely balance, but it's livestock growth, both in the US as well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So, that becomes a heavier, I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions, weather conditions in Australia, et cetera, having an impact there. So, I think if you balance those out, and last point I'll make is, Librela, clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into Q1, but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year. So, Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Librela accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relatively speaking in Q1. So, when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now, we did make references to FX, so from a reported basis that again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. On the FX factor, hopefully what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So, that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with good momentum as we exited Q4 and into Q1, again looking at US companion animal. But that's how I think about it. Now, is Q1 going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective? I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stocking, that's $12 million to $15 million. So, even if you had a flat, that means you grew by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here right now. What I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, last year we saw some discounting in front of the NexGard combo launch. Do you anticipate there might be similar competitive dynamics in front of a Elanco\u2019s Quatro launch? And how are you thinking about that in consideration with the gross margins? And then just the second one on just the DTC efforts in Librela? I don't think there is DC allowed in Europe, but can you talk about maybe some of the learnings that you learned in Europe in terms of marketing and how they might apply specifically around communication of the vet? The vet obviously is the one that understands the superior safety profile with monoclonal antibodies and may maybe how that messaging can come out. Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean, I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio, with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year overall, Trio grew 9%. So, we're very pleased with that. As we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid to high single digit growth in Trio for the year. So, this obviously underscores, and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So, we do anticipate, obviously a competitor entering. I'm not exactly sure what - how Purdue or Proctor will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product. They do mention tapeworm, but you get tapeworm from fleas, and we absolutely control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So, we are used to having good competitors, obviously with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional, but I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience, switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone on Trio is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto-ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market. What we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, et cetera. So, as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on, what do we learn from Librela in Europe? So, we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets, both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain, to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness. I think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to, and encouraging them that there is a new product and that they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplifts from direct-to-consumer advertising, even when it's not branded. So, I don\u2019t know, Wetteny, if you wanted to add into that. \nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio\u2019s been performing really well for us in the face of direct competition in the US. Couldn't be more pleased, and to be gaining patient share in the face of competition, I think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So, look, there'll be some initial, I'm sure heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in. We factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't home in on specific reaction and so on. But we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow the franchise. And we're saying we're going to see mid to high single digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. good morning and thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on the derm franchise. I think you had talked about mid to high single digit growth for the franchise overall. I guess specifically, are you assuming a headwind within that guidance from the competitive entry that's likely to occur against Apoquel this year? And can you talk about the strategies you're maybe putting in place to defend market share for that product? And then a quick follow-up on China, could you maybe frame the type of headwind that you expect in China in 2024? And does that impact more on the companion or livestock side of the market? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Yep, sure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that that growth is obviously understated given the price, if you're looking at the pre-price buying that we saw in late 2022. As we look at our guidance for mid to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow, as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the US who have pruritus. There is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated, but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So, we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products. Our products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious, and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vets, and we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, both a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet. And our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in applicable chewables and moving them to chewables, which pet owners really prefer. We've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the US and we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term, on the long acting. So, we are going to defend this franchise. We're confident in this franchise. Our guidance of mid to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the US and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring lifecycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. And one point on derm, of course we have a mid to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance, of course, across a broad range of expectation. There\u2019s various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, et cetera, will play into that. And the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow. Our franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting it to deteriorate nor improve, at least through the first half of our year. And we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, a little bit less so into the first half of 2024, but still headwinds into the first half of 2024. You continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So, all those factors. Of course, long-term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade, but in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth. In fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the questions. A couple. firstly, I just wanted to understand the currency dynamics better, considering that most of the nearly 100 basis points based on revenue and 150 basis points based on EPS seems to be growing from here. Why is FX so severe and any particular currencies hurting you? I mean, my general understanding is with $4 billion plus of export revenues and dollar weakening, I thought the impact would have been the other way around. Second question is around the FDA letter that Zoetis has received on Librela number. I want to understand how frequent or normal are these kinds of letters on the animal health side and the issues that FDA found with Librela\u2019s promotion, with the inclusion of the P value on the secondary end points? And what is the current status now with regard to your communication with the FDA? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: So, I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I assume you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification. What you're talking about was a request for clarification on our promotional materials. We just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean, this isn't uncommon. So, I don't - that was easily resolved last year. That was a minor issue, but Wetteny, do you want to take the second question?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. On currency dynamics - and again, we don't forecast FX, so we tend to report out what we see the impact is. And the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina. If you follow Argentina, there've been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back, as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August, and there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those. Clearly, there's an impact on top line that we've talked about, but there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time. So, by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down the bottom line. So, combination of Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced than their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they devalue. That's what you\u2019re seeing play out. But really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First, can you talk a little bit about the pre-price buying the quarter? Are you able to quantify how much of a headwind that was? And then maybe talk about should we expect that to be a headwind going forward at all? Are you guys still working through that? And a follow-up to that maybe higher level, is there anything in the pipeline or kind of in product cycle management that you guys can share with us? You're still spending a lot of money in R&D, and even for next year, it looks like that may not be a specific area to get leverage off of the R&D line. So, anything that you'd be able to share with us there would be helpful. Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre-price buying in our - as we exit the year, given what our price increases are going to be. I would say compared to the prior year where there was higher than average pre-price buying ending 2022 into 2023, which had the effect on 2024, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of pre-price buying exiting 2023, and that gave us really first the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into, but also I would say our order position walking into January 2024 was certainly in better position than say the prior year. So, we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers.\nKristin Peck: Sure. And the question with regard to R&D, obviously we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health. And as you look at the how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium, and long-term in animal health different than human health. That really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like lifecycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apoquel chewable, which will significantly support our key brands. We're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one-to-three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long actings. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term in really important new franchises as well such as renal chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes. There's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics, as well as behind our livestock business, looking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So, we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So, we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two for me. Just latest on vet visit growth. I know it's not the primary driver of growth for your business, but you're targeting 0% to 1% this year. And I'm just trying to get more color on what\u2019s the underlying kind of dynamics here. Is this mostly still vet capacity? Is it macro dynamics? Just any color there would be appreciated. And then my second question was just coming back to Librela ex-US. From your perspective, how penetrated is the market for monoclonals at this point? And where do you see the largest opportunity for growth in these markets? I'm sure you have a sense of like, are we in the second inning or the seventh inning of the ramp ex-US? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered, as we've spoken about many times before to vet visits. I mean, obviously, they're not inconsequential. Our view of zero to one is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time. So, I think we're really saying it's back to a normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the US, but I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto-ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it. But we really sort of view the year, as you look into the year for 2023, although we saw flat vet visits, we saw revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So, we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, et cetera. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the US, I think we're still early innings. And really where I think we see the growth is, right now that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs, I mean, I think, obviously, at least as someone, in my 50s, I will say my hip hurts right now, but everyone doesn't know that who is around me. And so, the reality is, osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're limping and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think is critical. So, I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain, and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think the more we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise. So, we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Steven Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChris LoBianco: Hi, this is Chris on for Steve. We have two questions. First on Librela, to what degree are US vet capacity constraints a headwind to longer term treatment compliance? And then is there a regulatory path for the approval of an at-home owner-administered formulation? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So, vet capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on, but I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech, and I think the industry's really focused. And we've been partnering with corporates, with the AVMA, with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So, we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a US issue. It's global. So far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second questions with regard to home delivery, you want to take that one? \nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock innovation not only in our OA pain mAbs, but across our portfolio, are really, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela, will be the direction that will help with this, even though, as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the mAbs. I think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, et cetera. And that varies a bit, but, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nNavann Ty: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one on Librela and one on Trio. The first one on Librela, with continued investments in 2024, what are the remaining SG&A needs in addition to the current DTC campaign? And just a clarification, do you currently expect Librela to become potentially gross margin accretive in 2025? And then on Trio, can you help us explaining the switches from the NexGard Plus? Are they mostly from BI\u2019s own NexGard rather than from Simparica Trio, and you see uptake from BI on younger dogs and puppies mostly? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: I\u2019ll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments and we already started, because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about a year and a half or so ago. So, we're able to leverage those investments and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product. The gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023, and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage. So, 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it is below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see it at those innovative levels, which is well above the company average. So, hopefully that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth. Trio grew 17% in the US in Q4, and we continue to gain patient share, which means again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe, efficacious, and been in the market for almost four years now. So, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know, Kristin, if you want to add anything.\nKristin Peck: The only add, we're doing quite well with puppies. You asked specifically with regards to puppies. I mean, puppies are on the Trio label, so I just want to emphasize that. I know it wasn't on the original Simparica. So, I mean, really you are looking at new starts, we see a lot of puppies and we see a lot of conversion from single and dual-agent customers to a triple combination, and certainly a movement to more people from topicals to oral. So, there's lots of ways for us to continue to gain market share for that product, but we're doing quite well with puppies, to answer that other part of your question.\nOperator: And there appears to be no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Great. Thank you all so much for the questions, and honestly, for continued interest in Zoetis. I want to underscore that the enduring strength of the human-animal bond for pet owners\u2019 expectations of human quality healthcare for pets, and the need for safe and secure food supply, all underscore the animal health industry is essential and very durable. We remain confident about our strategy and the ongoing value proposition, because we know that our colleagues will make a difference every day in everything that we're doing. And with their support, I want to reiterate that we expect to grow faster than the market again in 2024, not just in line, and to grow operational revenue by mid to high single digits. We are firmly committed to investing in our innovative pipeline, our portfolio, and the DTC programs we need to support the broadening and building billion-dollar franchises. The animal health industry is resilient even in times of uncertainty, and we are poised to navigate these challenges because our portfolio diversity, our commitment to exceptional customer experience, operational excellence and agility, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress on future calls. Thanks much for joining us today, guys. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve and welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Today, we reported strong full-year results driven by the success of our diverse portfolio across markets and species, game-changing innovation, and the outstanding commitment of our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 7% operational revenue growth, growing faster than the industry, propelled by steady demand for innovative products that enable our customers and the animals they care for to thrive. With the ongoing momentum of our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis or OA pain, we saw segment growth of 6% of the US and 9% operational growth internationally. Our companion animal portfolio remains a key growth driver, up 8% operationally, and we saw a return to growth for our livestock portfolio, up 6% operationally. While we continue to operate in an environment of global uncertainty, our diversity across markets, species, and therapeutic areas, has sustained our performance, further demonstrating that animal health is a durable, essential, and growing industry. Our track record of innovation, from pioneering breakthroughs to product lifecycle enhancements, has solidified our position as the industry leader, consistently growing above the market and enables us to create market-leading franchises. We don't just follow trends, we make markets.  The launch of Librela and Solensia, the first two injectable monoclonal antibodies for the alleviation of osteoarthritis, is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs and cats, and strengthening the human-animal bond. That's why today Librela remains the number one selling OA pain product in Europe. At Investor Day last May, and again at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, I shared that our own pain franchise could have peak sales exceeding $1 billion, and we are excited about Librela's performance since its US launch in October, which reaffirms that view. Due to high clinic penetration, we've activated our direct-to-consumer or DTC efforts faster than any other product in our history, which we expect to provide a tailwind for commercial growth. Similarly, Solensia has also been well received, with strong clinic penetration around the world, with increased opportunity as we generate more awareness of OA pain in cats.  Within our dermatology franchise, we've established ourselves as the trusted partner to veterinarians, and after nearly a decade of impressive growth, we still believe we have room to expand this market. Increasing pet owner's awareness that itch is a medical condition that requires treatment, improved compliance, and the opportunity to address even more unmet needs, underpins our optimism. We remain confident that we can sustain growth thanks to our differentiated products like Cytopoint and Apoquel chewable, the first and only chewable treatment for the control of allergic itch and inflammation in dogs. Our parasiticides portfolio, and particularly Simparica Trio, remains a key growth driver, even in the face of increasing competition. This continued success highlights our strategic execution, label strength, and the efficacy of our products. The performance across our key product franchises not only reinforces our market-leading position, but also better innovation consistently meet the evolving demands in veterinary medicine.  As we begin in 2024, we will stay disciplined and adaptable to the evolving macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop around the world, and focus on executing our plans and continuing to grow faster than the market. Two durable global trends give us confidence in that future growth, the powerful human-animal bond, and the world's growing need for a sustainable supply of animal protein. Our commitment to operational excellence ensures we are ready to scale to meet those demands and navigate unforeseen challenges, while delivering shareholder value. Looking ahead, we are committed to our track record of value creation and above-market performance. Our dedication to innovation remains the cornerstone of our market-leading position. We've consistently demonstrated agility, outpacing the market to bring groundbreaking solutions that meet and exceed customer expectations. We will continue to leverage that advantage and we're guiding to a range of 7% to 9% operational revenue growth in 2024, and adjusted net income growth in the range of 9% to 11% operationally, which reflects our ongoing investments in R&D, supply chains, and commercial excellence, to cultivate new markets, drive growth, and create value. As you've heard me say time and time again, we are confident in our strategy, portfolio, pipeline, and capabilities to deliver value to shareholders and customers, while performing above the market. Our focus positions us well to navigate potential challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities.  In closing, we'll continue our relentless pursuit to exceed customer expectations and invest in advancing the capabilities that differentiate Zoetis. As we look to 2024, I could not be more excited about our future. Our key growth drivers will continue to showcase our commitment to nurturing the world and humankind by advancing care for animals, and our ongoing innovations will expand the market, reaffirm our best-in-class product portfolio, and defend our position amid competition. I want to reiterate the four tenets of our value proposition discussed on Investor Day. We will grow revenue faster than the market. We will invest in innovation and growth capabilities. We commit to growing adjusted net income faster than revenue, and we'll return excess capital to shareholders. While there is need and demand to improve the quality of life for animals, Zoetis will continue leading the way and setting the standard for performance and growth. This is core to our vision, to be the most trusted and valued animal health company, shaping the future of animal care through innovation, customer obsession, and purpose-driven colleagues.  Thank you. Now, let me hand it over to Wetteny. Wetteny? Thank you, Erin. I will take the first question on Librela and let Wetteny take that second question. Yes, we were very pleased with how we did with Librela in the first full quarter of launch in Q4. As you saw, we did about $44 million in the quarter, $47 million for the year, including the early experience trial. And really how we achieved that was our penetration was ahead of schedule, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. Given that penetration, which is in the high 60s, we actually began DTC ahead of what we were expecting. Reorder rates are coming in exactly where we expected, in line with our expectations. So, that makes us really confident as we go into the year. We're looking at what - your other question was what kind of stocking or inventory build we saw in the clinics. It's hard to give you a firm number. It's somewhere between a quarter and a third, I would say, overall in stocking. But look, this is the number one selling pain product in Europe, and we have no doubt it will be that in the US as well. So, we're quite pleased and certainly ahead of our plan on penetration. And look, with our direct-to-consumer advertising investments, we've already started late last year and into Q1 to drive growth in this product in the US. So, I'll let Wetteny take the second question. No, it's great. Sure. I'll start with that one and Wetteny can certainly build on it. I mean, I want to first underscore, we had a very strong Q4 with Trio, with 21% growth in the quarter with competition. For the year overall, Trio grew 9%. So, we're very pleased with that. As we guided and Wetteny mentioned earlier, we're expecting mid to high single digit growth in Trio for the year. So, this obviously underscores, and we think we'll see that both in price and in volume. So, we do anticipate, obviously a competitor entering. I'm not exactly sure what - how Purdue or Proctor will do it. Our expectation is that is not a differentiated product. They do mention tapeworm, but you get tapeworm from fleas, and we absolutely control fleas. So, therefore, that's really not a differentiated product. So, we are used to having good competitors, obviously with NexGard. I'm sure there'll be some heavy promotional, but I think our strength, honestly, with our corporate accounts, the experience, switching is low for people with this product. It's very unlikely someone on Trio is going to switch. We're doing quite well with retail and auto-ship, which I think also protects us. And we expect a new competitor to expand the market. What we're seeing a lot is a movement into the triple combos out of topicals, collars, et cetera. So, as we look at that, we're confident in our Trio number as we look into the year. And with regards to your question on, what do we learn from Librela in Europe? So, we cannot do branded advertising for Librela in Europe, but we can do overall advertising for disease awareness and encouraging people who have pets, both dogs and cats with osteoarthritis pain, to bring them to the vet. And we are seeing real impact of that disease awareness. I think it's been a long time where pet owners have not had a product that they could turn to, and encouraging them that there is a new product and that they should go to the vet and be seen. We are seeing really positive uplifts from direct-to-consumer advertising, even when it's not branded. So, I don't know, Wetteny, if you wanted to add into that. Yep, sure. I'll take the derm question, and I think Wetteny can follow up on your China question. Look, we saw strong growth both in the quarter and overall in derm at 8%. And I just want to underscore that that growth is obviously understated given the price, if you're looking at the pre-price buying that we saw in late 2022. As we look at our guidance for mid to high single-digit growth for our derm franchise in 2024, that is the expectation that we will see a competitor launch. We expect this market to continue to expand and grow, as we've talked about. There are 85 million dogs in the US who have pruritus. There is still over 6 million untreated dogs and 3.5 million who are treated, but with steroids and sort of over-the-counter products. So, we strongly believe this is a market we can continue to expand. Look, we've had two products been on the market seven and 10 years, respectively. We've had millions of dogs on these products. Our products have been proven over time to be safe and efficacious, and they're trusted by pet owners. They're trusted by vets, and we're seeing more and more a switch to Cytopoint, both a preference for compliance by both the pet owner and the vet. And our competition, we're expecting to come in a film-coated tablet. And if you look at that, we're really focused on investing in applicable chewables and moving them to chewables, which pet owners really prefer. We've been successful in doing this in Europe. We're quite focused on doing this in the US and we're also continuing to look at innovation in the short term, on the long acting. So, we are going to defend this franchise. We're confident in this franchise. Our guidance of mid to high single digits demonstrates that we believe we can continue to grow this market in the US and around the world, not just defend our brand, but continue to bring lifecycle innovation to the space over time to grow our share. Wetteny, do you want to take China? So, I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take it. I assume you're referencing the letter back in November. Honestly, the letter is uneventful and was well addressed. We immediately resolved the request for clarification. What you're talking about was a request for clarification on our promotional materials. We just made a minor change to the promotional materials and how we represented some statistical data. The concerns are well addressed and the modifications were accepted by the FDA. I mean, this isn't uncommon. So, I don't - that was easily resolved last year. That was a minor issue, but Wetteny, do you want to take the second question? Sure. And the question with regard to R&D, obviously we are very confident in our pipeline. I think we've been the most innovative company in animal health. And as you look at the how we exceeded market growth every year for the last 11 years, it is due to the innovation in our pipeline. We are investing both for the short, medium, and long-term in animal health different than human health. That really makes a difference. You look at sort of what I call like lifecycle enhancements that we just launched such as Apoquel chewable, which will significantly support our key brands. We're also looking at pretty disruptive innovations as well. As you look at sort of the short one-to-three-year term of innovation, we're excited really for some of our long actings. And we've talked a lot about investing in the medium to long term in really important new franchises as well such as renal chronic kidney disease spaces, looking at cardiology, looking at oncology and diabetes. There's really important spaces of unmet medical need in animal health that we're really excited to tackle. We're continuing to invest behind our diagnostics, as well as behind our livestock business, looking at new vaccines and immunomodulators in our genetics business. So, we have a very diverse pipeline because we have a diverse portfolio. So, we're continuing to invest behind that and remain very confident in that. Sure. I mean, starting on the first, we are not very levered, as we've spoken about many times before to vet visits. I mean, obviously, they're not inconsequential. Our view of zero to one is that's where it's historically been. That is historically what you see in vet clinic visits over time. So, I think we're really saying it's back to a normal. What's really happening is there's strong end market demand. There remains some capacity issues in the US, but I think some of that's being addressed by more stuff going to auto-ship and retail and online, which has also been supporting it. But we really sort of view the year, as you look into the year for 2023, although we saw flat vet visits, we saw revenue and revenue per visit up 7.5%. So, we really are seeing really strong growth, obviously overall in revenue, and we're much more correlated over time with that, just given the strength of our portfolio, et cetera. And to your second question with regards to Librela outside the US, I think we're still early innings. And really where I think we see the growth is, right now that product is primarily being used in severe dogs. I think getting it into more moderate dogs, I mean, I think, obviously, at least as someone, in my 50s, I will say my hip hurts right now, but everyone doesn't know that who is around me. And so, the reality is, osteoarthritis exists in animals long before they're limping and can't walk up the stairs. And the more we can control that pain early, I think is critical. So, I think what we're really trying to change the paradigm is getting Librela in first line use for animals with osteoarthritis pain, and getting it into more of those moderate dogs. And we think the more we can do that, the more we can continue to grow the market here and grow our franchise. So, we know, we believe we're in early innings across the globe with regards to osteoarthritis pain with both Librela and certainly with Solensia, where we still have to continue to grow awareness for osteoarthritis pain in cats. Sure. Obviously, making sure that pet owners can get in monthly for their injections is critical. So, vet capacity is certainly something that we're quite focused on, but I think after the first visit, this is an injection that can certainly be done by a vet tech, and I think the industry's really focused. And we've been partnering with corporates, with the AVMA, with lots of people to really think about how to change the paradigm of vets to vet techs and clinics and things like that. So, we believe there are solutions to really address some of the vet capacity issues. So far globally, and by the way, this vet capacity issue is not just a US issue. It's global. So far, it hasn't affected the growth of our key products. And your second questions with regard to home delivery, you want to take that one? The only add, we're doing quite well with puppies. You asked specifically with regards to puppies. I mean, puppies are on the Trio label, so I just want to emphasize that. I know it wasn't on the original Simparica.

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong year in 2023, with revenue of $8.5 billion and adjusted net income of $2.5 billion. Our full-year revenue was near the top end of our guidance range, while our adjusted net income was slightly below our guidance range, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange, as well as an impairment charge related to a prior acquisition. Our revenue growth was broad, with strong growth across both our US and international segments, both our companion animal and livestock portfolios, and due to both price and volume. Full-year revenue grew 6% on a reported basis and 7% operationally, with adjusted net income anchoring 7% on both a reported and operational basis. Of the 7% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 2% is from volume. Volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela, and Solensia, as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio.  On a segment basis, our US business posted $4.6 billion in revenue, growing 6% on the year, while our international segment reported revenue of $3.9 billion, with operational growth of 9% on the full year. Additionally, while China represents less than 5% of our global revenues, the ongoing economic weakness there continues to impact our business, and represented a half a percentage point drag on our total company operational revenue growth for the year, entirely in volume. Our full-year growth was driven by continued demand for our innovative companion animal portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Our livestock portfolio also had a strong year, with operational growth of 6%. Performance in companion animal was led by OA pain mAbs, which posted $321 million in global revenue for the year. Growth came from first wave European markets, as well as from the impact of new launch markets in 2023, including the US. We continue to see penetration of our pain mAbs grow within vet clinics, and a high level of satisfaction amongst both vets and pet owners.  Our key dermatology products generated $1.4 billion in sales globally, posting strong growth of 8% for the year on an operational basis. Simparica Trio contributed global revenue of $813 million in 2023, representing growth of 9% operationally, despite distributor inventory headwinds in Q1 and aggressive competitive promotions for much of the year. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $356 million in revenue and grew 7% operational, with growth contributions from both the US and international. Our livestock portfolio had a strong year, with 6% operational revenue growth, driven by both price and volume. Moving on to our Q4 financial results, which was another strong quarter. We closed Q4 with revenue of $2.2 billion, representing an increase of 8% on both a reported and operational basis, posting our third consecutive quarter of at least 8% operational revenue growth despite a tough comparative, particularly in US companion animal. Adjusted net income of $569 million is an increase of 6% on both a reported and an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 6% is from price and 2% is on volume. Volume growth consisted of 4% growth from new products and a 2% decline in our inline products. Volume from our key dermatology products was flat in the quarter. On a segment basis, our US business posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 9% on the quarter, while our international segment reported revenue of $982 million, with operational growth of 8% on the quarter. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in the quarter, growing 10% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 6%. We saw double-digit companion animal growth in both our US and our international segments, driven by our innovative products. Our OA pain mAbs were the primary driver of growth, posting $124 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Global growth came primarily from the impact of new launch markets, bolstered by the Q4 full launch of Librela in the US. Simparica Trio generated $208 million globally in the quarter, representing growth of 21% operationally. Price was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, followed by volume growth, driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally, as well as from increased field force focus. Our key dermatology products generated $375 million in sales globally, posting growth of 7% on an operational basis. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded revenue of $87 million and grew 8% operationally, with growth contributions from both the US and international. Our livestock products ended the year on a strong note, with growth of 6% operationally, growing in both our US and international segments. Growth was driven equally by price, which grew despite headwinds from drags in price decreases, as well as by volume, with growth in Synovex from our expanded label claims. Now, moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. US revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 9%, with companion animal sales growing 10%, and livestock sales growing 4%. Companion animal again posted double-digit growth in the quarter, bolstered by the full launch of Librela at the start of the quarter, all while facing a tough comparative quarter with promotional activity and heavier than normal pre-price buying at the end of last year. In the US, vet clinic visits were flat on the quarter and flat for the year, while we continue to see solid clinical revenue and revenue per visit, growth of 6% for the quarter and 7.5% for the year. Our US companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth due in part to our innovative therapeutics, as well as our strong presence in the retail channel.  Moving on to product performance, growth in the US was driven by our pain mAbs, Simparica Trio, and our key dermatology portfolio. Our combined pain mAbs posted $58 million in US sales in Q4. We moved to a full launch of Librela in the US early in the fourth quarter, and we have been pleased with the results our field force has been able to drive thus far. Librela posted $44 million in US sales in the quarter, which is at the higher end of our initial expectations. It's important to note that while we are not leveraging distribution for our pain mAbs, there's a significant clinic stocking impact in the first few months after launch. We have seen higher than expected penetration and reorder rates through the end of the year, as well as rapid patient share growth in the canine pain category. Solensia had sales of $14 million in Q4 in the US. We have seen a marked increase in feline vet visits and feline revenue growth in the clinic. In the US, feline OA patients are up 23% for 2023. Simparica Trio posted US sales of $185 million in the quarter, growing 17%. Growth was driven primarily by price as we were in promotions in Q4 of 2022 following our Q3 2022 supply challenges, and in advance of a then expected competitor launch in early 2023. In our second quarter, with competition in the triple combination space, we continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio. We remain confident in our ability to compete and grow in this space through the strength of our label, retail channel presence, strong corporate and specialty relationships, and the significant advantage of being first to market. (Indiscernible) dermatology product sales in the US were $252 million in the quarter, growing 6%. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth through both price and volume, with vet and pet owners referring its injectable method of administration. (Operational) franchise growth is driven by better net price realization on lower volume due to promotional activity at the end of last year. Our US companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 9% in the quarter. US livestock grew 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by growth in poultry as a result of favorable rotations back to certain medicated feed additives and the extended use of Zoamix, as well as share gain due to competitor supply constraints. Sales of both swine and cattle products increased in the quarter, primarily as a result of increased supply of vaccines that were limited in the same quarter of the prior year.  Moving on to our international segment where revenue in the quarter grew 9% on a reported basis and 8%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. International companion animal grew 10% operationally, and livestock grew 7% operationally. China represented a 3% drag on our international segment operational revenue growth in the quarter. Higher sales in companion animal products was led by our pain mAbs, our key dermatology products, and our small animal parasiticides portfolio. Growth in our OA pain products was equally driven by sales force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launching European markets, as well as continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $53 million internationally or 93% operational growth in the quarter. Solensia sales were $13 million internationally in the quarter, growing 77% operationally. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $123 million in revenue, posting growth of 10% in the quarter on an operational basis. We continue to see benefit to Apoquel from our DTC awareness campaigns across several international markets and conversion to Apoquel chewable has been positive. Growth in Cytopoint continues to benefit from higher rates of conversion from Apoquel and overall market growth. Our international small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 4% operationally, driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $48 million in revenue and growing 32% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven primarily by price, a strong parasiticide season, and demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio contributed $23 million internationally, growing 72% operationally, driven by high peak season sales in Australia and continued uptake in Europe, driven by key account penetration and field force effectiveness. This growth was partially offset by a 33% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China where we had a tough comparative quarter due to the return of supply in Q4 of 2022, as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. Continuing on to international livestock, which was 7% operationally, driven primarily by price increases in all species, especially in high inflationary markets. Our poultry portfolio also benefited from favorable MFA rotations in certain markets. China had an unfavorable impact on our international livestock sales in the quarter, particularly in our swine portfolio. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L, for the quarter adjusted gross margins of 67.1% decreased 100 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. On an operational basis, adjusted gross margins decreased by 20 basis points, resulting primarily from higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by price increases and lower freight costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which grew 10% operationally, primarily due to higher competition-related expenses, as well as a charitable contribution related to the funding of the Zoetis Foundation. R&D expenses grew 17% on an operational basis, driven by higher compensation-related expenses, as well as portfolio progression of key pipeline projects. Finally, other income and deductions were higher in the quarter due to an impairment charge related to an acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, a decrease of 200 basis points, primarily due to higher net discrete tax benefits in the quarter, a higher benefit in the US related to foreign derived intangible income, and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. Adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, and adjusted diluted EPS grew 7% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $198 million. For the full year, we had capital expenditures of $732 million. Lastly, we continue to return excess capital to shareholders. For the year, we have returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders through a combination of share purchases and dividends. In December, we announced a 15% annual dividend increase, continuing our commitment to grow our dividend at or faster than the growth in adjusted net income.  Now, moving on to our guidance for the full year of 2024. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. We are expecting foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on our growth versus the prior year. At net revenue, we expect foreign exchange to negatively impact our growth by 90 basis points, with the impact being more pronounced early in the year and decreasing later in the year. At adjusted net income, we expect FX to negatively impact our growth by 150 basis points, with significant unfavorable impact in the first half of the year, transitioning to slight favorability in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we do not actively forecast FX, so these estimates assume rates remain where they were as of late January. For 2024, we are projecting revenue between $9.075 billion and $9.225 billion, representing a range of 7% to 9% operational growth, with growth across both price and volume. We expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2024. With the expected impact of the US launch of Librela, we expect to see robust growth from our OA pain mAbs, both in the US and internationally. Our current clinic penetration levels for Librela in the US are exceeding our expectations, and as Kristin mentioned, we have launched our DTC efforts ahead of schedule to drive increased pet owner awareness. Even with the expectation of competitive entrance, we anticipate mid to high single-digit growth in both Simparica Trio and our key dermatology portfolio. For livestock, 2023 exceeded our expectations. Our growth in the year benefited from several tailwinds, including improvements in supply in certain markets, as well as competitive out of stocks. While our outlook for the upcoming year is more optimistic than it was as we entered 2023, we do expect our growth rate to normalize and be in line with livestock industry growth. I'd like to briefly touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth. For companion animal, we are not projecting significant change to the current vet clinic trends. We expect US visits to grow flat to 1%, and expect to see growth in therapeutic visits aided by the impact of our OA pain products. For our companion animal parasiticides, we continue to expect meaningful growth from Simparica Trio. We expect new entrants will help continue to drive the conversion from topicals and collars to triple combination of our parasiticides, a space where we are the market leader. In our key dermatology products, we are prepared for competition and confident in our ability to defend and grow our share through our three differentiated dermatology products, the strength of our customer relationships, and the expertise we have gained from almost 10 years in the space. Lastly, while we are not assuming a change in the current economic situation in China, we do expect a headwind to growth, especially in the first half as the situation worsened over the course of 2023. Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be approximately 29.5%. We continue to make investments to ensure we can support expected future growth in our portfolio, especially in monoclonal antibodies. These investments are driving short-term margin impacts from lower site utilization. This is offset by price increases and favorable product mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $2.17 billion and $2.22 billion, with the increase from 2023 focused on supporting primary drivers of revenue growth. Adjusted R&D expenses for 2024 is expected to be between $665 million and $675 million. Spend is driven by the advancement of key pipeline projects, as well as higher compensation-related expenses. Adjusted interest expense and other income and deductions is expected to be approximately $210 million. This is significantly higher than the prior year as our growth here is negatively impacted by the non-recurring royalty settlement income we reflected in Q1 of 2023, as well as the impact of lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2024 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Adjusted in income is expected to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.70 billion, representing operational growth of 9% to 11%. Our guidance once again reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.74 to $.584, and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. And finally, we are anticipating capital expenditures in 2024 to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. These levels remain elevated compared to historical spend levels as we continue to make investments to support our future growth. To summarize, 2023 was another strong year. Even with distributor inventory headwinds entering the year and a challenging economic environment, especially in China, we again outperformed the market. We continue to grow share even in spaces where we face new competition, and we remain confident in our ability to expand existing markets and create new ones in the future. As we move into 2024, our guidance highlights our ability to again grow faster than the market, driven by our innovative product portfolio and multiple sources of growth, as well as our ability to grow our bottom line faster than our pipeline, while making meaningful investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders.  Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Yes, sure. Look, when looking at margins, yes, indeed there are some moving factors when you think about 2024 and then beyond. We do have Librela in 2023, as we said at Investor Day. If you look at our monoclonal antibodies at peak, particularly as we ramp up production in our capacity, which was built to make sure that we're confident in being able to take advantage of demand, they started out as being dilutive to the overall company average. For example, in 2023. As we go into 2024, Librela becomes accretive to our overall margins, but still below what you would consider our innovative companion animal products. And as we exit 2024 into 2025 and beyond, it becomes more in line with our innovative companion animal products. So, overall, beyond 2024, I won't give you specific guidance here in terms of what to expect, but I think if you look at it, we continue to expect companion animal to outpace the growth of livestock. So, that mix will continue to be favorable for us. And as we get into the higher levels of production for monoclonal antibodies, they're also accretive to overall margins and we're positioned to be able to leverage our SG&A base as well. So, all of those should translate to margin expansion through the P&L over time. But as we've demonstrated, we're not afraid to make the right investments behind our products, behind our key franchises as we see them, investments in R&D, as you saw in 2023. And as the guide implies, R&D will continue to grow faster than revenue as well. So, those investments will slightly offset some of those, but we'll position to continue to expand. Yes, sure, Mike. Let take this and then see what Kristin wants to add. So, take a look at margins. Indeed in 2024, we are guiding to about 100 basis points of expansion and margins. Keep in mind, when you look at 2023 and how we ended, Q4 had about 100 basis points of margin impact. And about 80 of that is from FX. So, you're talking about roughly 20 basis points when you consider manufacturing costs and a little bit of mix. Now, looking at mix, we had clearly really strong and quite frankly a strong year in livestock. And we're actually here at the national sales meeting for our livestock with our livestock team in Utah. And look, they've had a great year, and we expect livestock continue to grow as we go into 2024, but clearly ended stronger at the end. So, that created a little bit of a mix, and as well as outperforming our expectations exiting the year is also, as I said, a bit diluted. So, when you look at mix and manufacturing costs, you're still talking about 20 basis points of headwind exiting 2023. Most of the impact here is coming from FX, about 80 basis points. The other items that we referenced in our prepared commentary with respect to impact on the quarter and how we ended, FX as I explained, the impact on our finish here, if you take a look at FX, which is clearly non-operational, and you factor non-recurring items like the impairment charge for the prior acquisition, those two items are about $0.07 of headwind in the quarter, in 2023 in the fourth quarter. So, that's really the vast majority of what you saw impacting us here. Of course, we don't forecast FX. So, what we bake into our guidance for 2024 is essentially what would happen if we assume FX rates stay where they are at the end of January here. And with that, on a constant basis, we would expect to expand margins in 2024. And so, that's really consistent with how we've approached our forecasting in the past. And I won't sit here and guess at what FX is going to do throughout the year 2024. that will have an impact either favorable or unfavorable, depending on how that goes.  For the other part of your question, I just want to maybe talk a little bit about Librela, how we expect Librela. Clearly, when you think about how we will deliver on 7% to 9% operational growth in revenue, price is a pretty significant factor. We continue to expect to be running price above our historic levels of two to three points, and perhaps slightly below what you saw in 2023 at 5%. And then Librela with the US launch clearly is going to be a significant factor. Certainly, $44 million in the quarter in Q4 was - again, very pleased to see that. We do see about a quarter to a third of that being initial stocking. So, you can model that out. In terms of what that would translate to, we're still in the early stages of our launch, but we're very pleased with what we're seeing so far, as we discussed already. In international, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing. If you look at international, the fourth quarter, you still have about 47% growth if you look at the base markets where we were launched at the beginning of the year. And then the new markets are driving another bit of growth. You have another $12 million contribution from those new markets, in addition to the US $44 million. So, I think what we have to really take into account here is, as we've been launching in markets in Europe, there's some stocking that happens from quarter to quarter as we do those launches. If you factor those out and you just focus on those markets that were already launched, we're talking about 47% growth in the quarter, which has been consistent over the last few quarters, about 50%, give or take growth. So, we couldn't be more pleased with what we're seeing in the international markets. Kristin? Look, I'll take the cadence point first and then see what Kristin wants to add in terms of Librela expectations. Look, sitting here, I would expect a roughly balanced cadence across the year. Now, let's take a look at Q1, which is a specific point you raised in your question, Jon. If you look at Q1, certainly, if you look at companion animal in the US, there's an easier comp. We had destocking the first quarter last year, clearly something we look to see as an easier comp that we come up against. But at the same time, you had a 12% growth quarter in livestock in Q1. And so, I think if you look balance - those don't completely balance, but it's livestock growth, both in the US as well as international. And then you have China, which clearly started to more deteriorate in terms of the economic conditions there throughout the year. So, that becomes a heavier, I would say, headwind coming into Q1 as well as the conditions, weather conditions in Australia, et cetera, having an impact there. So, I think if you balance those out, and last point I'll make is, Librela, clearly very pleased with how we exit Q4 and enter into Q1, but it's going to continue to contribute more and more as you go through the year. So, Q2 and Q3 would be more than Q1. Therefore, the contribution from Librela accelerates through the year and it doesn't have as much relatively speaking in Q1. So, when you take all those into consideration, I actually see a roughly balanced year. Now, we did make references to FX, so from a reported basis that again, taking a look at where the FX rates were a couple weeks ago, you do have a heavier impact in terms of both revenue and bottom line. On the FX factor, hopefully what we provide in prepared commentary is helpful there. So, that's the other piece you have to think about. But when I think about operational base growth, I mean, we did exit the year with good momentum as we exited Q4 and into Q1, again looking at US companion animal. But that's how I think about it. Now, is Q1 going to be higher than Q4 from a Librela perspective? I think if you factor about a quarter to a third of impact coming from stocking, that's $12 million to $15 million. So, even if you had a flat, that means you grew by $12 million to $15 million going into Q1. I won't call it exactly here right now. What I would say is we're pleased with how the product is performing, but we are still in the early stages of this launch. Yes. Look, I think you covered it, Kristin. Trio's been performing really well for us in the face of direct competition in the US. Couldn't be more pleased, and to be gaining patient share in the face of competition, I think that speaks a lot to what we've been talking about, which is the power of our relationships, the strength of our label and being first to market. So, look, there'll be some initial, I'm sure heavy promotion that happens when a new competitor comes in. We factor some of that into our thinking here. But until we see the label and see what they do, we won't home in on specific reaction and so on. But we're very confident in our ability to continue to grow the franchise. And we're saying we're going to see mid to high single digit growth across Trio in 2024 as well. Yes, sure. And one point on derm, of course we have a mid to high single-digit growth expectation that we laid out in our guidance, of course, across a broad range of expectation. There's various scenarios around competitor entry, timing, pricing, et cetera, will play into that. And the label that they have, of course, will be playing into how that plays out. But we're confident in our ability to grow. Our franchise has been around for a decade in this space. On China, we've been consistent on this one. I think we continue to see sort of the broad economic situation there to remain where it is. We're not expecting it to deteriorate nor improve, at least through the first half of our year. And we also have stronger comps similar to the second half of 2023, a little bit less so into the first half of 2024, but still headwinds into the first half of 2024. You continue to see consumer confidence being low and swine prices remaining fairly depressed in consumption there as well. So, all those factors. Of course, long-term, we continue to expect China to be a strong growth market. It has done exceptionally well for us over the last decade, but in the near term, we're not expecting that to be a contribution to growth. In fact, we'll see some declining comps in the first half on China. Yes, sure. On currency dynamics - and again, we don't forecast FX, so we tend to report out what we see the impact is. And the dollar continues to strengthen against the number of currencies that we operate in. And there's a little bit of a disproportional effect that we see on some of the higher inflationary markets like Argentina. If you follow Argentina, there've been two really significant drops in terms of FX rates versus the dollar, if you follow back, as we ended last year, both in December and I think back in August, and there's a little bit of a delayed effect on those. Clearly, there's an impact on top line that we've talked about, but there's also a little bit of a delayed effect if you look at the impact it has on inventory and receivables that are on the books at the time. So, by the time you collect those, they have a greater impact, which is why you see the impact down the bottom line. So, combination of Argentina, Brazil, Turkey, those are more pronounced than their relative percentage of our revenues, given how significantly they devalue. That's what you're seeing play out. But really across the board, if you look at how the dollar ended the year, it ended a bit stronger than you saw throughout the average of the year. Yes, sure. I'll take the first one and then Kristin will cover the second one. Look, there's always some level of pre-price buying in our - as we exit the year, given what our price increases are going to be. I would say compared to the prior year where there was higher than average pre-price buying ending 2022 into 2023, which had the effect on 2024, we more actively managed customer orders in terms of pre-price buying exiting 2023, and that gave us really first the underlying market strength and momentum that we carried into, but also I would say our order position walking into January 2024 was certainly in better position than say the prior year. So, we more actively manage those, but there's always some level in the numbers. Yes. Look, I think the regulatory path to that isn't really the direction we're going in terms of where we think we can make an impact here. Livestock innovation not only in our OA pain mAbs, but across our portfolio, are really, really important. And as I look ahead, I think longer acting formulations, both Solensia and Librela, will be the direction that will help with this, even though, as Kristin said, we're not seeing any significant impact in terms of our ability to grow the mAbs. I think initial visits where the vet has to see the pet and do the injection beyond that, the techs are able to do it, et cetera. And that varies a bit, but, but we don't see that as being a significant impact for us. I'll take the first one on Librela. Look, of course, we are going to be making investments and we already started, because as you heard in the prepared commentary, our penetration levels are running above our expectations, and we've launched DTC on Librela, and we're already doing DTC across Europe and international markets as well. As we look ahead, we did make significant investments in our field force going back about a year and a half or so ago. So, we're able to leverage those investments and we don't see incremental investments beyond those to drive our expectations and take advantage of demand on the product. The gross margin picture, as I mentioned earlier, it is dilutive if you look at 2023, and particularly because you saw us outperform expectations on Librela in 2023, right? As you go into 2024, Librela margins are actually accretive to the overall company margin leverage. So, 70%-ish gross margins for the company, Librela is above that, but it is below the gross margins that you would see in our innovative companion animal brands. As we get beyond 2024, you will start to see it at those innovative levels, which is well above the company average. So, hopefully that helps clarify that point. Trio, as we've said, we've seen really strong performance in Trio, posting double-digit growth. Trio grew 17% in the US in Q4, and we continue to gain patient share, which means again, switching is low when you have a product that's safe, efficacious, and been in the market for almost four years now. So, we're very pleased with what we're seeing. I don't know, Kristin, if you want to add anything."

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, November 2, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve. And welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2023. We generated strong performance in the third quarter, driven by our diverse companion animal portfolio of key dermatology products, pet parasiticides, monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and diagnostics. We delivered 8% operational growth in revenue and 13% operational growth in adjusted net income, despite continued market challenges in China. We showed balanced segment growth this quarter with 8% operational growth internationally, and 8% growth in the U.S. Our companion animal portfolio grew 11% and our livestock portfolio grew 3% operational -- operationally in 3Q, in line with our overall expectations.  Through the first nine months of the year, we have grown our revenue 7% operationally, as customers place a premium on the animal health benefits that our products delivered, even in times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. As the market leader in animal health, we compete in an essential global industry that has been resilient during various economic cycles. And we continue growing above the market based on a steady pipeline of new products, lifecycle innovations, and commercial execution.  We are on track to achieve our full year operational guidance and have narrowed it around the midpoint of the range, as we continue to balance headwinds and tailwind in the marketplace. We are executing well on the drivers where we have more control, like the successful launch of Librela in the U.S., while also mitigating the downside of macroeconomic declines in China, both of which were not considered in our original guidance this year.  Once again, our diverse portfolio across product categories and geographies generate durable, reliable long term growth. We continue to expect our key companion animal franchises to be our core catalysts for growth. We anticipate strong growth and our market leading dermatology portfolio for the year, building on the ongoing direct to consumer or DTC digital campaigns that support disease and product awareness. As well as the continued introduction of life cycle innovations like Apoquel Chewable.  Our compare to franchise and broader portfolio of parasiticides continue to perform well in this increasingly competitive product category, based on our innovative and highly effective products and promotional support from DTC.  In terms of new products, we're very pleased with the U.S. launch of Librela, our canine monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis or OA pain. This product has been very well received by veterinarians and pet owners in the U.S., as well as other major markets globally. And we have built ample supply for continued growth in the U.S. and elsewhere.  Solensia, our monoclonal antibody for OA paining cats has also been well received by veterinarians in markets around the world. As we look to help increase medicalization of cats. We're building awareness of this condition among cat owners, and introducing our monoclonal antibody treatment through DTC campaigns, as well as AI tools like cat pain IQ, which helps that and pet owners use videos to identify this condition.  Our diagnostic portfolio has been showing stronger year-over-year performance in 2023, with 14% operational growth in the third quarter, and we continue to refine this business to better serve customer needs across our comprehensive portfolio. For example, we're simplifying our reference lab service and operating model in the U.S. and focusing on expanding our larger regional hubs, which can deliver one-day turnaround and have more modernized operations. We also continue to emphasize the benefits of AI technology and our virtual lab services to enhance the speed and quality of our diagnostic solutions.  With all this in mind, we are narrowing our full year guidance for operational growth to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% in revenue and a range of 7.5% to 8.5% in adjusted net income, keeping the same midpoint as our prior guidance. Wetteny will provide more details on guidance in his remarks.  We continue to see strong underlying customer demand this year and into 2024, even while recovery in China is still a notable uncertainty. The majority of that practices in the U.S. continue to see high customer demand for veterinary services. However, labor constraints and more limited hours continue to hamper their ability to meet this demand. Year-to-date, clinic visits are flat as we expected. We did see a modest decline in clinic visits this quarter in the U.S., while clinic visit revenues and average revenue per visit were up.  Looking ahead, we remain confident in the sustainable underlying demand for animal health, based on the strength of the human animal bond, people's willingness to spend on pet house and the essential need for safe and secure food supply. We expect to achieve double digit operational growth for our companion animal portfolio this year and low single digit operational growth in our livestock portfolio. Before I wrap up, I want to reiterate a theme I discussed earlier this year at Investor Day. It's the confidence we have in sustaining our key market leading franchises across dermatology, pet parasiticides and osteoarthritis pain based on life cycle innovations in these categories as well as the pipeline we are exploring in other areas of unmet need. We are firmly committed to investing in our portfolio as well as the DTC programs and capabilities we need to support our growth, while managing costs and creating value for our shareholders. Despite economic and geopolitical uncertainties in China and elsewhere, we believe we will continue to grow faster than the market for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. This confidence stems from our diverse portfolio across markets and species. Our industry-leading franchises, the ongoing launch of Librela and the operational excellence and agility that our people deliver every day for our business and for our customers. So thank you, and let me hand this over to Wetteny. Wetteny?\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, with broad-based growth across both our U.S. and international segments across both companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and across both price and volume. For the quarter, we were able to deliver results in line with our expectations, even in light of continued headwinds in China. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 7% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $629 million grew 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 3% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth, growing 11% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 3% in the quarter. Companion animal growth was again driven by our innovative products with double-digit operational growth in our key dermatology portfolio, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia and Simparica Trio. Our key dermatology products generated $393 million in sales globally, posting growth of 14% on an operational basis with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international. Globally, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain posted $77 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Growth came primarily from our European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets internationally. With the October full launch of Librela in the U.S., our pain products are now available in most major markets. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $206 million in the quarter, representing growth of 20% operationally versus the comparable 2022 period. Growth was driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as from increased field force and promotional focus. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $90 million and grew 14% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our life sci portfolio grew 3% operationally, with international growth partially offset by a slight decline in the U.S. Growth in livestock was driven primarily by price, especially in high inflationary markets. We also saw volume growth in our poultry portfolio, driven by increased usage of vaccines as well as our antioxodio product, Zoamix in the U.S. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 8%, with companion animal products growing 11% and livestock sales declining 2%. On the companion animal side, while vet clinic visits declined 1.5% in the quarter, we continue to see robust play in revenue growth, up 6% versus a year ago. Average revenue per visit is up over 7%. On a year-to-date basis, clinic visits are flat, while clinic revenue is growing 8%. These trends highlight the continued durability of pet owner willingness to spend as well as the continued impact of vet clinic staffing challenges.  Our companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth, due in part to our continued upsized growth in retail channel. Turning to product performance. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven by our key dermatology portfolio, Simparica Trio and Solensia. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $260 million in the quarter, growing 13%. Simparica point sales continued to drive growth in the quarter, with vets showing a preference for injectables due to higher compliance and pet owners appreciating the longer duration of treatment. Apoquel sales were driven by growth in the retail channel as pet owners continue to rely more heavily on retail for ongoing pharmacy needs as well as retail auto ship programs that drive higher compliance. Our latest dermatology life cycle innovation at Apoquel Chewable was launched in the U.S. in October. Apoquel Chewable has been well received in Europe, as pet owners favor the ease of chewable administration over film-coated tablets. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $184 million in the quarter, growing 17%, driven by increased focus in our parasiticide promotional programs. We continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio, even with the recent competitive launch in the triple combination space. We remain confident in our ability to compete through our superior label, strong retail channel presence, and the strength of our corporate and specialty relationships. In the U.S., our pain products posted sales of $15 million in the quarter. We continue to see solid player penetration growth for Solensia, as well as an uptick in Feline clinic visits and expect to continue to drive awareness of Feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns. Librela has been well received by early experience program participants and their patients during the third quarter. We moved to a full launch in mid-October. We have been very pleased with post launch performance thus far, and are confident that we have ample supply to meet our demand expectations. Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 18% in the quarter, as we continue to see positive results from the new field force we introduced last year. We saw strong placement growth in the quarter, especially on our images device. U.S. livestock sales declined 2% in the quarter, primarily resulting from the timing of supply on certain cattle products in the prior year, where we had an improved supply position and restocking in the channel, which drove a strong comparable quarter. The Q3 decline was partially offset by growth in our cattle productivity implant, Synovex due to extended label claims. The cattle decline was partially offset by growth in poultry due to vaccines and the extended use of Zoamix, an alternative to antibiotic medicated feed additives. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on both a reported and operational basis in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 12% operationally and livestock grew 5% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, our key dermatology products and our small animal parasiticides portfolio. Growth in our OA pain products was bolstered by field force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launch European markets, specifically the U.K. and Germany, as well as the continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $50 million international or 55% operational growth in the quarter, despite a slightly more difficult comparator in Q3 of 2022 due to the removal of supply constraints in our international markets. We remain confident in our ability to supply our forecasted demand for Librela. Solensia sales were $12 million in the quarter. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $133 million of revenue and grew 17% operationally. We saw double-digit growth across most of our major markets and strong uptake of Apoquel Chewable. Apoquel growth was driven primarily by the delayed itch season in Europe and Canada. Cytopoint growth was driven by continued patient expansion and higher compliance in existing patients. Our international small animal are parasiticides portfolio growth of 9% operationally was driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $40 million in revenue, growing 29% operationally, driven primarily by demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio posted $23 million, growing 47% on an operational basis, driven by growth in corporate account contracts. The Simparica franchise performance was partially offset by a 16% operational decline in Revolution franchise, driven by a difficult comparable period in China, due to the return of supply in the prior year as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. As Kristin mentioned, we have seen declines in China due to the ongoing economic challenges, particularly on the companion animal side, which were not fully reflected in our initial guidance. We continue to monitor economic conditions. However, we are not expecting an improvement this year or into the first half of next year. Our international livestock segment grew 5% operationally in the quarter, driven primarily by price increases, especially in high inflationary markets. Growth was driven primarily by our cattle portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Brazil was the largest contributor, where we have seen price growth, supply recovery on certain products as well as continued improvement in cattle industry dynamics. Additionally, the prior was a weak comparative period due to the impact of supply disruptions and a more uncertain industry dynamic led to a lowering of channel inventories in the quarter. Our poultry business also contributed to growth in the quarter, growing 9% operationally due to increased key account penetration in emerging markets. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 70.5% improved 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of price increases and lower freight charges. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, inventory charges and product mix. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which were 5% operationally due to higher competition related expenses. R&D expenses grew 13% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased project spend for our pipeline projects. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.6%, a decrease of 130 basis points due to favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings and a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, partially offset by lower net discrete tax benefits. And finally, adjusted net income was 13% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 15% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $145 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October, which reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year. Due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, we are revising our reported revenue range while narrowing our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.475 billion and $8.55 billion, with a range of 6.5% to 7.5% operational growth. Our previous guidance was 6% to 8%. We have been pleased with our operational performance thus far. While foreign exchange headwinds have been larger than expected, our year-to-date operational revenue growth of 7% is in line with our expectations. We expect to benefit from the approval and launch of Librela in the U.S., which is included in our revised guidance last quarter as well as the performance of our Lifestyle business. However, ongoing uncertainty in China has continued to offset upside potential. We are expecting adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.51 billion, also slightly lower, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. Operationally, we are narrowing our growth expectations to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%, previously 7% to 9%. Expected reported diluted EPS narrows to a range of $5.14 to $5.21. And adjusted diluted EPS narrows to $5.38 to $5.43. Finally, to summarize before we go to Q&A. Our broad-based growth across species and geographies despite the challenging economic environment in China, continue to highlight the resilience of our portfolio and of the animal health industry. We remain committed to growing above the industry, driven by our innovative portfolio, commercial execution and multiple sources of in-line growth. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. \nJon Block: Great, thanks guys. Good morning. I promise one long question. So in companion animal, the overall revenue was a bit shy of what we had expected, but you really had great performance what we call sort of the big 5 products. So atopic derm, Trio map, the big 5 were all ahead of our estimate. So maybe if you guys can talk a little bit about the ongoing uptake of some of those key big 5 products even with a more difficult consumer, right? Because people view some of those as discretionary. Again, the results were really strong and even despite the more difficult consumer. And then the flip side would just be like anything to site regarding the legacy products, right? So if you back into legacy that might have been modestly down year-over-year. And a quick part B on the follow-up, Kristin, you mentioned faster growth for Zoetis than market and get in '24. I don't think we're really surprised by that. You've done that year in and year out. But can I push you a little bit on how we should think about for Zoetis in '24 versus Zoetis in '23? In other words, if we take into account the OA pain uptake, if you would, could we see accelerated growth for the company in '24 versus '23 when we think about all the moving parts?\nKristin Peck: Wow. Okay. So John, great question. I think there's like 20 questions on that one. So I don't know how we would do that, but let me start, and then I'll let Wetteny build on it. To your point, we had really strong growth across our franchises. And if you look at dermatology, it's 14% in the quarter, Paris [ph] at 10%, diagnostics at 14% and the overall pain portfolio at 91%. So there really was strong growth across all those. Obviously, leading the growth there will be pain. And as you look into 2024, we see that as well with significant optimism about where that's going to go, we're very pleased with where that launch is. These are both Librela and Solensia, 2 products that are very early in their life cycle with significant growth. And I think if you really double click if you look at international, who already have these products in the market for a while, you're seeing great growth. Importantly, we're continuing to see really strong compliance on those products across Europe. As someone who currently has a dog who has an early experience, who look at their second dose of Librela, the difference that it makes, I really can't see any pet owner taking their dogs off these world-leading medications. So maybe Wetteny, if you want to take on some of the detailed questions you had around derm, paris and Solensia. But to your point, we remain very optimistic looking into 2024 about the strength of our companion animal portfolio and the 11% was in line with what we expected to be honest. But Wetteny, do you want to give more detail on some of that?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, absolutely. Look, the 11% growth operationally in companion animal is right in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. And the overall growth of 8% operational, I would even say, is slightly above. If you recall on the last call, we said expect Q3 to come in somewhere between the mid and the high end of our growth rate. So that's roughly between 7% and 8%, so at the high end of that.  But in terms of consumer, look, as we've said time and time again, if you look at the therapeutics category in terms of the value in pet health as well as some of the chronic conditions, as Kristin mentioned, consumers have not been treating those as discretionary. Even when you see some relative softness in pet spend, it doesn't carry over into the health care piece in terms of therapeutics, et cetera. And we've seen that play out in many ways even as I'm sure we'll get into a -- clinic visits are slightly down in the quarter. Clinic revenue is up almost 7%, and we're growing faster than that. Again, retail being a part of that, and we'll get into that in a little bit more detail. When I look at the big products, as you described them, John, derm, Triomabs, all up double digits and up across U.S. and international. I mean our growth this quarter was broad-based, across companion animal livestock U.S. international price, 5% volume on 3%. So really broad-based. And I think that really underscores the breadth of our products as well as our innovation and the value that consumer and pet owners place on products. The legacy products, when I look at in line, keep in mind, when we talk price, we tend to see price lift in those legacy products as well. But when it volume, it wasn't down. In-line products were actually flat on the quarter year-on-year with some lift on price. So hopefully, that helps. But I share the optimism Kristin described with respect to 2024. I mean we have multiple sources of growth, not only the Librela launch in the U.S. You've got continued growth across international markets for Librela and Solensia as well. And of course, we'll have price as a lever in addition to in-line products we just talked about. Livestock is now back to growth, and we'll look at what that looks like when we come back with guidance next year. And then we expect growth across our key franchises as well in terms of derm, paris and diagnostics. So I'll cap it there as a long answer to a long question, but we'll take the next one.\nOperator: Certainly, we'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Thanks. On Librela, can you talk a little bit about the initial feedback for U.S. practices? Will there be any initial clinic level stocking? I think you said your expectations are intact there. But any lumpiness quarter-to-quarter that we should be thinking about? Has anything changed in terms of your expectations there? And then as we think about margin expansion next year, given Librela won't be at critical mass so that we may weigh on the gross margin. But is there still some underlying operating leverage that we should think about across the business?\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Erin. I'll take the first half of the question, and Wetteny can take the second half of the question. We launched in the U.S., the early experience trial in September with 400 clinics. As I mentioned, my dog puppy was actually one of those dogs. We went to a full launch in mid-October once we got a full dose in, and that's really the uptake was really strong. Very pleased with the results. We're obviously still in the early stages, but we're seeing it very similar to what we saw in Europe. Both vets and pet owners are super excited. We make sure that we've got ample supply as both Wetteny and I mentioned, because we do see this as a strong ramp, as you saw what happened in international. International had a supply constraint for a while. And as soon as we open that, we saw where that really went. So we continue to see really strong demand. Penetration is going really well in the clinics in the U.S. and the experience is broadening. There will be some small initial stocking for sure in some of those clinics, but I don't know if I would call that lumpiness going into next year. There definitely was obviously, they stock it. And our hope is we continue to just continue to drive that growth going forward. It is the number 1 selling OA pain product in Europe. We expect it to obviously be the same in the U.S. If you look at the U.S. in particular, Erin, there are 26 million medicalized dogs with OA. So this is a big market that we're going after, and this is a game-changing product. So we really see a very strong potential with this.  We think Librela will expand the market. And as we've mentioned before, we really do think Librela and Solensia alone can be a $1 billion portfolio for us. And that's in a market today that was only $400 million. So I think that sort of underscores where we see growth there. But do you want to talk about the margin expansion issue, Wetteny?\nWetteny Joseph : Sure. I will. Look, you're right, Erin. In terms of -- as we said, when you look at ABS at peak, once they ramp up, they will be additive and accretive to our gross margins. We believe they're also accretive to our contribution margin, even when there are what I'll say is subscale in terms of getting towards their peak. So as we launch into the U.S., which is a large market, obviously, as you said, we'll see a little bit of a headwind from a gross margin perspective. But given many of the investments that we need to drive this field force, et cetera, already in the books, if you will. There will be some incremental A&P and DTC. And once we have the right level of penetration of the product in clinics, but that's still going to leave room for contribution margin lift in the product. So that will be, I would say, a factor from a gross margin standpoint. But we'll give more precision in terms of guidance for '24 at the next call. But as you can read from us and what we're saying today, we're very excited about '24. We're optimistic on '24, given the levers I just described. So in line with what we said at Investor Day, we expect to grow in the mid- to high single digits. I think you'll continue to see us look for margin expansion given the mix up in companion animal versus large [indiscernible], but I won't give you any more and more specific than that.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich : Great. Thank you, so much the question. I wanted to stick with Librela. And Kristin, specifically ask about how vets are diagnosing OA pain and starting dogs on therapy? You obviously talked about the large number of pets that could benefit from this, but relatively few dogs on treatment. I guess, anything you can share in terms of diagnosis rates for practices that were in the early experience program and where those diagnoses are coming from? Are these dogs currently on a pain product and maybe switching to Librela or these new dogs being diagnosed? Anything there would be great. And then a quick follow-up on the international performance of Librela. It looks like it was roughly flat sequentially on a constant currency basis. Any learnings on seasonality or anything like that on the international side, now that that's been on the market for a little bit?\nKristin Peck: Sure. A few things I'd say there. Unlike cat pain, which we can certainly talk about if someone has a question on it. Dog OA pain and osteoarthritis has been diagnosed quite well by that. This is not hard to diagnose dogs, unlike cats, do not hide it. You can sense they're less active. They limp. They don't want to go upstairs. It is not hard to diagnose. And a lot of these dogs are already being treated. They're being treated with our product, Rimadyl and other OA products. There's diets for this is not a space where there's not a developed market, a developed protocol for diagnosis. That is not the case in cats, where we do have to really develop protocols for diagnosis. What we saw initially is the first dogs they put on are the most symptomatic dogs, where they know that like they really are really struggling. I think if you look at what we've seen in international is as vets get more comfortable with it, they then start providing it for dogs earlier in the OA pain, which actually is even better. They have greater quality of life over time. So our experience of diagnosis is really coming out of international, which is normally initially the dogs they first put it on are the one suffering the most where their pet owners are begging for it. And then over time, you move into earlier stages of OA. But again, this is not one that is hard to diagnose for vets. They have protocols to do that today. So we're not really as concerned here in the diagnosis part. I think what we really need to do and we see growth in '24 and beyond in '25 and '26 is having that really provide a product like Librela to dog earlier in their disease, which I think will be a good growth driver. And in international, that is definitely not the case. We're seeing phenomenal growth right now. It is definitely not flat. But Wetteny, do you want to get into some of the specifics of the international growth situation there?\nWetteny Joseph : Yes, absolutely. Look, if you look at Librela, we delivered $53 million in revenues in Q3. That's a 65% growth operationally. Now if you look at the preexisting markets, they were up about 33%. So that's an incremental $10 million or $11 million in the quarter year-on-year growth in the pre-existing markets. And then new markets that have been launched this year is about $10 million that includes a little bit from the U.S. from the early experience program. So year-on-year growth and then sequentially, I think was your question, and we're still up a few million sequentially. Just keep in mind, Q3 last year, as we said, we have a bit of a tougher comp for Q3, because that's when we released sort of the allocations that we're on and the supply constraints. So that is factoring a little bit, but we still had 33% in the in the EU sort of locations in markets where we had previously launched. So that's still a very robust growth despite the comp.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just on 2024 on derm, do you expect the competitive launch outside of the one we already know from Elanco. How comfortable do you feel about your decision to price Apoquel Chewables at parity with your existing products? And are there any analogs for chewables as a competitive differentiator in front of a competitive launch? And just as a quick follow-up on the R&D. It did step down a little bit, and I think you're guiding for it down. Is there anything are we reading in it too much to say maybe there's not a new product -- a significant new product in 2024, 2025 and maybe reading into that too much.\nKristin Peck : Sure. As we look for competition in dermatology to your question, we are expecting competition in the second half of next year. Our knowledge is that really there's only one that we're aware of at this point that we're expecting in 2024. We obviously don't know when in the second half that it would be coming. But we're well positioned for competition. As we've been preparing for competition for a while. We both have Cytopoint, we have monopole antibodies. We've got Apoquel. We've got Chew. We've got a pipeline behind that of continued life cycle innovations with longer-duration monoclonal antibodies, other species. So dermatology is a critical portfolio for us. We're continuing to grow. We did 14% in the quarter. So we're going to invest heavily behind this to make sure that we can continue to grow both our portfolio and the market overall. And if you look at chewable pricing, our strategy was let's move everybody to a product that's even easier that their dog like even more that they see as a treat, before you have competition, which we're expecting to be in a film coated tablet, similar to the original Apoquel. So we do see this as a really strong defense strategy for us. We've been seeing great as you look at the growth in international in the quarter. It was led by the conversion to Apoquel Chewable. And in the U.S., a lot of the growth in derm for us was also led by retail, which has done really, really well. To your point on R&D, I'll let Wetteny take it, but there's absolutely nothing going on there in the sense of any weakness in our portfolio. But Wetteny, do you want to talk about sort of what drove some of that?\nWetteny Joseph : Yes, absolutely. Look, as Kristin just said, we remain on target with our regulatory milestones with respect to R&D spend was up about 13% year-over-year on the quarter. So clearly, well above our revenue growth rate. So what you're seeing in terms of our overall expectations for the year versus where we're landing is just a matter of timing on the span of gross projects, but nothing significant or notable there. Again, we continue to drive innovation, both across new innovation as well as life cycle innovation across our portfolio, and we're very excited about the progress we're making in R&D.\nKristin Peck : Yes. It's mostly just timing of investments. I mean it varies quarter-to-quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin : Right. Thanks for taking question. Mostly, I want to focus on Trio. You had a really solid result in the U.S., but it's sort of in that ramping up phase. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market between yourself and the key competitors, BI, Merck, Elanco and specifically, BI just flashed NexGard PLUS, we saw a relatively surprising decline in Bravecto revenues from Merck? So I'm just curious, any change to competitive dynamics, anything you're seeing in terms of pricing or stocking or destocking and how that impacts Trio? And then just a follow-up on the very last question. CapEx as well, you slashed the guide this year pretty significantly. I think I heard you say Wetteny, the $725 million to $750 million and previously it was I think, $900 million to $1 billion. So just curious, did that get pushed out into '24 as well? Or is there -- any other change there?\nKristin Peck : Sure. I'll take the first half of the question, see if Wetteny want to build on it and then Wetteny, if you want to handle the CapEx question. We did see strong growth in Trio in the quarter, 20% in Q3 for Trio. It remains the number 1 fleet tick heartworm in the U.S. by revenue. And really importantly, it's continuing to grow share. It's up 3% in the quarter. It's also growing patient share, which was up 2% in the quarter. So we're expecting solid growth this year. Obviously, we -- there's a new competitor. But in the Q4, I would also say to watch, we got a challenging comp as you look at us in Q4. If you remember, we got back into stock and ran a number of promotions in Q4 of last year. But we continue to expect strong growth for the year there. Even with the destocking that we saw in the U.S. in Q1 and the pre-price buying, as we talked about before that you had in Q4 of 2022. So we see this as a franchise that will continue to grow. A lot of our growth is really being driven by our auto ship, by retail, which remains very strong for us, with our corporate accounts. This is also a category where you do see low switching once you get on a product. So we do believe the broadest portfolio, but continue to see strength in Trio. So we're happy with the growth we've seen there. But Wetteny, anything you add that I miss there, and you want to talk about CapEx?\nWetteny Joseph : Yes, sure. Look, on Trio, I think you covered it well, $206 million of revenue in the quarter. That's up 20% operationally. We're very pleased with that, including the patient share gains that Kristin already described. On CapEx, yes, we did reduce our CapEx expectations for the year from about $950 million to $1 billion down to $725 million to $750 million. This is really on timing of project spend. We remain committed to the investments that we're making. And this is still representing about a 25% increase in CapEx year-over-year. So as we said at Investor Day, excise CapEx to remain elevated for the next couple of years, and then we'll start to bring that down sort of in the range of a growth rate that approximates our revenue growth range as you go beyond '24, \u201825-time frame. So again, really just don't matter of timing is what you're seeing from a CapEx standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez : Hi. Good morning, thank for taking my question. On the companion animal side of things, it's a nice strong quarter. I think you had said, if I heard you correctly, that in 2023, you expect full year organic growth, double digits. The question being, I think you're at 7% year-to-date. I'm kind of being a little dangerous here and playing with my model live, but I think it implies kind of like a high teens organic growth in companion animal in the fourth quarter. One, am I thinking about that correctly? And then two, what's kind of giving you the confidence that the business can do that, especially, I think Q4 is a little bit more difficult year-over-year comp.\nWetteny Joseph : Yes, I'll be happy to take that. Look, we continue to see, as you saw this quarter, 11% operational growth in companion animal. And though we have some tough comps, as Kristin just referenced with the Trio answer on previous question, we are expecting very, very strong growth across companion animal. And keep in mind, we have some comp challenges with respect to livestock, which will decelerate from what it is on a year-to-date basis, about 6% to a low single-digit growth. So as you look at what's factored into the guidance that we just gave in narrowing the range, but still maintaining our midpoint, if you will, you can factor that into your equation in terms of what the livestock versus companion animal mix is as we exit the year.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad : Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions from me. Firstly, to the extent you can without commenting on any '24 guidance. Can you highlight some of the macro factors and how you expect that to change? Speaking -- looking at the diagnostic space of consumer trends, better option volume? And secondly, a bit more specific. Can you speak about your Librela supply plans? You recently opened a facility, a new facility in Lincoln and what impact does that have for supply costs and margins?\nKristin Peck : Sure. I'll start with the beginning and then Wetteny maybe you can build on it. We continue to see very strong macro drivers in animal health. It's really led by the humanization of pets, which is a global trend. It's also led we continue to look at 2024 as to who's adopting those pets, which is more of millennial and Gen-Z and importantly, more income households, who are really raising the standard of care that they want to spend on their pets. We see this as important drivers as we bring real innovation to the market with Librela, with Solensia certainly continuing with Cytopoint which is growing very strongly. So we look at the drivers of pet care globally, which is really who's adopting the pest, how they want to spend on their pets and looking at revenue per clinic, which continues to grow very strongly, which is what we're really correlated against. It's something that continues into 2024. These are strong macro drivers for us. As we've spoken about on the livestock side, we really believe that market historically, and we believe in the future will continue to grow. 2% to 4%, low single digits. And as we said, we were going to return to that growth rate as we start to fully lap the challenges with DRAXXIN. So as you look at livestock, what's driving that is a growing middle class and more consumption of protein, with the whole Ozempic thing aside, which really hasn't really impacted livestock or the consumption of protein globally, really because of who is really driving a lot of that growth, which is middle classes across the globe, and more and more people entering that and seeing and upgrading their protein. So we look at those macro drivers, and we really don't see any changes if we look into not just 2024, but 2025 and 2026. And when we bring innovation to those markets, we believe we can continue to grow ahead of that. So Wetteny, I'm not sure if I missed anything there, and if you want to take the second half of the question?\nWetteny Joseph : No, I think you covered the macro dynamics well, Kristin. On the supply question with respect to Librela, we are very confident in our supply plans to meet the demand expectations for Librela that we have certainly for '24 and beyond. Mentioning the Lincoln facility, certainly in addition to both our internal capacity and third party that we are using, we continue to invest internally. And I think if you look at Lincoln that will be a factor, particularly as you go beyond 2024, with respect to supply planning fully well and other maps as well. So again, very confident in our ability to meet those demand expectations, and we've already factored the ramp that we saw in Europe in our thinking around demand there as well.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead\nChris Schott: This is Ekaterina on for Chris. Thank you so much for taking a question. So first, very quickly, just on veterinary visits and the pressure we've been seeing there recently, can you just remind us how sensitive Zoetis is to be dynamic and maybe your latest thinking around how visits are going to trend maybe into 4Q and potentially into 2024, if you want to comment on that. And then the second question is just on U.S. cattle. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on the dynamics you saw in the quarter? Because I think one of your competitors mentioned the timing of the cattle kind of was shifted earlier this year. Is this something that you saw as well? And does that potentially create a headwind for you as you think about the fourth quarter?\nKristin Peck : Thanks, Ekaterina. I'll take your first question and Wetteny can build on me and then take the second. That business were flat year-to-date, which is what we've expected and what we talked about previously. In the quarter, they were down around 1.5% and as you discussed, we're really not as reliant on vet visits. The better proxy for us is revenue because again, remember that a lot of our products don't need to be purchased in the clinic. If you look at both auto ship, as you look at retail, you look at chronic medications, all of this continues to have us a higher correlation with overall revenue growth in the clinic. Historically, as we talked about before, vet clinic visits are flat to maybe 1% and if you look at where they stand today, they're still ahead of where they were pre-pandemic. So we don't pay as much attention to that vet clinic visit. If you look at revenue in the clinic, our growth in companion animal was higher than even that number, and that's because we're driving so much innovation there overall. So if you look at vet clinics business, we're not as tied to that number as we continue to say. So I don't know if there's anything I miss there Wetteny, what you want to build on, and then you want to take the second question?\nWetteny Joseph : Yes, sure. The only thing I would add on the vet clinic visits is you see our growth continues to outpace that of the clinic growth. And the vet visits were not as they're important, right? But we're not as sensitive to visit because therapeutics and chronic indications tend to power through that. And you can still see volume growth even as visits are down. And then the retail piece, which is continuing to grow. We've seen an additional 24% points as a percentage of our pet care revenues in the U.S. each year. So we've gone from 11% from about 5% just a few years ago. So we continue to see that in the quarter, it was up about 35%, if you look at our retail sales. So those are the factors I would add. With respect to the cattle dynamics and livestock in general, I would say clearly, we've had a very strong start to the year through the first 9 months. Livestock is up about 6%. Clearly, we're signaling that will come down in the fourth quarter. And that's really more of a factor of variability across quarters, given the timing of supply that we've had in the prior year versus the current year. The timing of when we've taken price adjustments for Jackson, for example, which impacted Q2 versus Q3 as well as Q4 this year as we're anticipating a step in that -- at the end of the year. So that will put some more pressure on Q4. We factored all that into our guidance that we've just issued today, which we are still in line with our expectations that we started the year with, which is right around our midpoint, we just narrowed it. So all those are in. With respect to capital dynamics around, we haven't seen anything that would say there's a pronounced shift with respect to the cattle run here. But again, we factored all these items into our thinking and what we've just iterated today from a guidance standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Scala TD Colin. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Chris on for Steve. Thanks a taking a question. We had 2. First, on the U.S. on the parasiticide market, can you provide an update on the estimated volume share of topical today? And then looking ahead to 2024, what is the risk of significant pricing pressure on Trio from the month of Credelio Quattro. Assuming a non-inferior product label type seems like the main level they could both to grow their market share. And then a clarifying question on U.S. Librela, can you confirm that U.S. sales were 0 in Q3? And then looking ahead to Q4, do you still expect sales to be immaterial for the full year?\nWetteny Joseph : Yes. Look, I'm not sure if I got the second question, but I'm going to give it a shot and then ask you to clarify. On the parasiticides market, we still estimate in terms of volume, nearly half is still in the collars and topicals, but from a value perspective dollars, we're significantly leaning on the calls and prescription. As those are at higher price points. I think you're asking a specific question about share for specific products within the topicals and collars and I don't have that to hand. But if it was a different question, I'll ask you to clarify after I give you an answer on Librela. So Librela, in the third quarter was minimal. As you know, in September, we had an early experience program. That was only about 400 clinics very limited with KOLs to get them using the product and being able to talk about it, et cetera, and helping with refining protocols and so on. And so the number was like $3 million in the quarter, not meaningful at all. And given the timing of the full launch in October and with the holidays coming, it is not going to have a meaningful impact on the full year growth again on that point. But I'll ask you to clarify if I didn't get the question right on Paris.\nOperator: It appears disconnected at this time.\nKristin Peck : Next question?\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Kristin for closing remarks.\nKristin Peck : Great. Thank you, everybody. Great questions today. Once again, we want to reiterate that we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance based on the diverse and innovative portfolio that continues to drive our success. We are firmly committed to continuing to invest in that portfolio as we look at the opportunities ahead of us, through DTC and building our capabilities to support our growth, but we'll also continue to manage our costs and ensure we're creating value for our shareholders. We continue to grow faster than the market by focusing on our people and our colleagues and on operational excellence and agility. They deliver every day for our business and for our customers. So we look forward to updating you on the full year and our long-term value proposition and hopefully seeing many of you in San Francisco at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference to kick off 2024. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And welcome, everyone, to our third quarter earnings call for 2023. We generated strong performance in the third quarter, driven by our diverse companion animal portfolio of key dermatology products, pet parasiticides, monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and diagnostics. We delivered 8% operational growth in revenue and 13% operational growth in adjusted net income, despite continued market challenges in China. We showed balanced segment growth this quarter with 8% operational growth internationally, and 8% growth in the U.S. Our companion animal portfolio grew 11% and our livestock portfolio grew 3% operational -- operationally in 3Q, in line with our overall expectations.  Through the first nine months of the year, we have grown our revenue 7% operationally, as customers place a premium on the animal health benefits that our products delivered, even in times of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. As the market leader in animal health, we compete in an essential global industry that has been resilient during various economic cycles. And we continue growing above the market based on a steady pipeline of new products, lifecycle innovations, and commercial execution.  We are on track to achieve our full year operational guidance and have narrowed it around the midpoint of the range, as we continue to balance headwinds and tailwind in the marketplace. We are executing well on the drivers where we have more control, like the successful launch of Librela in the U.S., while also mitigating the downside of macroeconomic declines in China, both of which were not considered in our original guidance this year.  Once again, our diverse portfolio across product categories and geographies generate durable, reliable long term growth. We continue to expect our key companion animal franchises to be our core catalysts for growth. We anticipate strong growth and our market leading dermatology portfolio for the year, building on the ongoing direct to consumer or DTC digital campaigns that support disease and product awareness. As well as the continued introduction of life cycle innovations like Apoquel Chewable.  Our compare to franchise and broader portfolio of parasiticides continue to perform well in this increasingly competitive product category, based on our innovative and highly effective products and promotional support from DTC.  In terms of new products, we're very pleased with the U.S. launch of Librela, our canine monoclonal antibody for osteoarthritis or OA pain. This product has been very well received by veterinarians and pet owners in the U.S., as well as other major markets globally. And we have built ample supply for continued growth in the U.S. and elsewhere.  Solensia, our monoclonal antibody for OA paining cats has also been well received by veterinarians in markets around the world. As we look to help increase medicalization of cats. We're building awareness of this condition among cat owners, and introducing our monoclonal antibody treatment through DTC campaigns, as well as AI tools like cat pain IQ, which helps that and pet owners use videos to identify this condition.  Our diagnostic portfolio has been showing stronger year-over-year performance in 2023, with 14% operational growth in the third quarter, and we continue to refine this business to better serve customer needs across our comprehensive portfolio. For example, we're simplifying our reference lab service and operating model in the U.S. and focusing on expanding our larger regional hubs, which can deliver one-day turnaround and have more modernized operations. We also continue to emphasize the benefits of AI technology and our virtual lab services to enhance the speed and quality of our diagnostic solutions.  With all this in mind, we are narrowing our full year guidance for operational growth to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% in revenue and a range of 7.5% to 8.5% in adjusted net income, keeping the same midpoint as our prior guidance. Wetteny will provide more details on guidance in his remarks.  We continue to see strong underlying customer demand this year and into 2024, even while recovery in China is still a notable uncertainty. The majority of that practices in the U.S. continue to see high customer demand for veterinary services. However, labor constraints and more limited hours continue to hamper their ability to meet this demand. Year-to-date, clinic visits are flat as we expected. We did see a modest decline in clinic visits this quarter in the U.S., while clinic visit revenues and average revenue per visit were up.  Looking ahead, we remain confident in the sustainable underlying demand for animal health, based on the strength of the human animal bond, people's willingness to spend on pet house and the essential need for safe and secure food supply. We expect to achieve double digit operational growth for our companion animal portfolio this year and low single digit operational growth in our livestock portfolio. Before I wrap up, I want to reiterate a theme I discussed earlier this year at Investor Day. It's the confidence we have in sustaining our key market leading franchises across dermatology, pet parasiticides and osteoarthritis pain based on life cycle innovations in these categories as well as the pipeline we are exploring in other areas of unmet need. We are firmly committed to investing in our portfolio as well as the DTC programs and capabilities we need to support our growth, while managing costs and creating value for our shareholders. Despite economic and geopolitical uncertainties in China and elsewhere, we believe we will continue to grow faster than the market for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024. This confidence stems from our diverse portfolio across markets and species. Our industry-leading franchises, the ongoing launch of Librela and the operational excellence and agility that our people deliver every day for our business and for our customers. So thank you, and let me hand this over to Wetteny. Wetteny? Wow. Okay. So John, great question. I think there's like 20 questions on that one. So I don't know how we would do that, but let me start, and then I'll let Wetteny build on it. To your point, we had really strong growth across our franchises. And if you look at dermatology, it's 14% in the quarter, Paris [ph] at 10%, diagnostics at 14% and the overall pain portfolio at 91%. So there really was strong growth across all those. Obviously, leading the growth there will be pain. And as you look into 2024, we see that as well with significant optimism about where that's going to go, we're very pleased with where that launch is. These are both Librela and Solensia, 2 products that are very early in their life cycle with significant growth. And I think if you really double click if you look at international, who already have these products in the market for a while, you're seeing great growth. Importantly, we're continuing to see really strong compliance on those products across Europe. As someone who currently has a dog who has an early experience, who look at their second dose of Librela, the difference that it makes, I really can't see any pet owner taking their dogs off these world-leading medications. So maybe Wetteny, if you want to take on some of the detailed questions you had around derm, paris and Solensia. But to your point, we remain very optimistic looking into 2024 about the strength of our companion animal portfolio and the 11% was in line with what we expected to be honest. But Wetteny, do you want to give more detail on some of that? Sure. Thanks, Erin. I'll take the first half of the question, and Wetteny can take the second half of the question. We launched in the U.S., the early experience trial in September with 400 clinics. As I mentioned, my dog puppy was actually one of those dogs. We went to a full launch in mid-October once we got a full dose in, and that's really the uptake was really strong. Very pleased with the results. We're obviously still in the early stages, but we're seeing it very similar to what we saw in Europe. Both vets and pet owners are super excited. We make sure that we've got ample supply as both Wetteny and I mentioned, because we do see this as a strong ramp, as you saw what happened in international. International had a supply constraint for a while. And as soon as we open that, we saw where that really went. So we continue to see really strong demand. Penetration is going really well in the clinics in the U.S. and the experience is broadening. There will be some small initial stocking for sure in some of those clinics, but I don't know if I would call that lumpiness going into next year. There definitely was obviously, they stock it. And our hope is we continue to just continue to drive that growth going forward. It is the number 1 selling OA pain product in Europe. We expect it to obviously be the same in the U.S. If you look at the U.S. in particular, Erin, there are 26 million medicalized dogs with OA. So this is a big market that we're going after, and this is a game-changing product. So we really see a very strong potential with this.  We think Librela will expand the market. And as we've mentioned before, we really do think Librela and Solensia alone can be a $1 billion portfolio for us. And that's in a market today that was only $400 million. So I think that sort of underscores where we see growth there. But do you want to talk about the margin expansion issue, Wetteny? Sure. A few things I'd say there. Unlike cat pain, which we can certainly talk about if someone has a question on it. Dog OA pain and osteoarthritis has been diagnosed quite well by that. This is not hard to diagnose dogs, unlike cats, do not hide it. You can sense they're less active. They limp. They don't want to go upstairs. It is not hard to diagnose. And a lot of these dogs are already being treated. They're being treated with our product, Rimadyl and other OA products. There's diets for this is not a space where there's not a developed market, a developed protocol for diagnosis. That is not the case in cats, where we do have to really develop protocols for diagnosis. What we saw initially is the first dogs they put on are the most symptomatic dogs, where they know that like they really are really struggling. I think if you look at what we've seen in international is as vets get more comfortable with it, they then start providing it for dogs earlier in the OA pain, which actually is even better. They have greater quality of life over time. So our experience of diagnosis is really coming out of international, which is normally initially the dogs they first put it on are the one suffering the most where their pet owners are begging for it. And then over time, you move into earlier stages of OA. But again, this is not one that is hard to diagnose for vets. They have protocols to do that today. So we're not really as concerned here in the diagnosis part. I think what we really need to do and we see growth in '24 and beyond in '25 and '26 is having that really provide a product like Librela to dog earlier in their disease, which I think will be a good growth driver. And in international, that is definitely not the case. We're seeing phenomenal growth right now. It is definitely not flat. But Wetteny, do you want to get into some of the specifics of the international growth situation there? Sure. As we look for competition in dermatology to your question, we are expecting competition in the second half of next year. Our knowledge is that really there's only one that we're aware of at this point that we're expecting in 2024. We obviously don't know when in the second half that it would be coming. But we're well positioned for competition. As we've been preparing for competition for a while. We both have Cytopoint, we have monopole antibodies. We've got Apoquel. We've got Chew. We've got a pipeline behind that of continued life cycle innovations with longer-duration monoclonal antibodies, other species. So dermatology is a critical portfolio for us. We're continuing to grow. We did 14% in the quarter. So we're going to invest heavily behind this to make sure that we can continue to grow both our portfolio and the market overall. And if you look at chewable pricing, our strategy was let's move everybody to a product that's even easier that their dog like even more that they see as a treat, before you have competition, which we're expecting to be in a film coated tablet, similar to the original Apoquel. So we do see this as a really strong defense strategy for us. We've been seeing great as you look at the growth in international in the quarter. It was led by the conversion to Apoquel Chewable. And in the U.S., a lot of the growth in derm for us was also led by retail, which has done really, really well. To your point on R&D, I'll let Wetteny take it, but there's absolutely nothing going on there in the sense of any weakness in our portfolio. But Wetteny, do you want to talk about sort of what drove some of that? Yes. It's mostly just timing of investments. I mean it varies quarter-to-quarter. Sure. I'll take the first half of the question, see if Wetteny want to build on it and then Wetteny, if you want to handle the CapEx question. We did see strong growth in Trio in the quarter, 20% in Q3 for Trio. It remains the number 1 fleet tick heartworm in the U.S. by revenue. And really importantly, it's continuing to grow share. It's up 3% in the quarter. It's also growing patient share, which was up 2% in the quarter. So we're expecting solid growth this year. Obviously, we -- there's a new competitor. But in the Q4, I would also say to watch, we got a challenging comp as you look at us in Q4. If you remember, we got back into stock and ran a number of promotions in Q4 of last year. But we continue to expect strong growth for the year there. Even with the destocking that we saw in the U.S. in Q1 and the pre-price buying, as we talked about before that you had in Q4 of 2022. So we see this as a franchise that will continue to grow. A lot of our growth is really being driven by our auto ship, by retail, which remains very strong for us, with our corporate accounts. This is also a category where you do see low switching once you get on a product. So we do believe the broadest portfolio, but continue to see strength in Trio. So we're happy with the growth we've seen there. But Wetteny, anything you add that I miss there, and you want to talk about CapEx? Sure. I'll start with the beginning and then Wetteny maybe you can build on it. We continue to see very strong macro drivers in animal health. It's really led by the humanization of pets, which is a global trend. It's also led we continue to look at 2024 as to who's adopting those pets, which is more of millennial and Gen-Z and importantly, more income households, who are really raising the standard of care that they want to spend on their pets. We see this as important drivers as we bring real innovation to the market with Librela, with Solensia certainly continuing with Cytopoint which is growing very strongly. So we look at the drivers of pet care globally, which is really who's adopting the pest, how they want to spend on their pets and looking at revenue per clinic, which continues to grow very strongly, which is what we're really correlated against. It's something that continues into 2024. These are strong macro drivers for us. As we've spoken about on the livestock side, we really believe that market historically, and we believe in the future will continue to grow. 2% to 4%, low single digits. And as we said, we were going to return to that growth rate as we start to fully lap the challenges with DRAXXIN. So as you look at livestock, what's driving that is a growing middle class and more consumption of protein, with the whole Ozempic thing aside, which really hasn't really impacted livestock or the consumption of protein globally, really because of who is really driving a lot of that growth, which is middle classes across the globe, and more and more people entering that and seeing and upgrading their protein. So we look at those macro drivers, and we really don't see any changes if we look into not just 2024, but 2025 and 2026. And when we bring innovation to those markets, we believe we can continue to grow ahead of that. So Wetteny, I'm not sure if I missed anything there, and if you want to take the second half of the question? Thanks, Ekaterina. I'll take your first question and Wetteny can build on me and then take the second. That business were flat year-to-date, which is what we've expected and what we talked about previously. In the quarter, they were down around 1.5% and as you discussed, we're really not as reliant on vet visits. The better proxy for us is revenue because again, remember that a lot of our products don't need to be purchased in the clinic. If you look at both auto ship, as you look at retail, you look at chronic medications, all of this continues to have us a higher correlation with overall revenue growth in the clinic. Historically, as we talked about before, vet clinic visits are flat to maybe 1% and if you look at where they stand today, they're still ahead of where they were pre-pandemic. So we don't pay as much attention to that vet clinic visit. If you look at revenue in the clinic, our growth in companion animal was higher than even that number, and that's because we're driving so much innovation there overall. So if you look at vet clinics business, we're not as tied to that number as we continue to say. So I don't know if there's anything I miss there Wetteny, what you want to build on, and then you want to take the second question? Next question? Great. Thank you, everybody. Great questions today. Once again, we want to reiterate that we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance based on the diverse and innovative portfolio that continues to drive our success. We are firmly committed to continuing to invest in that portfolio as we look at the opportunities ahead of us, through DTC and building our capabilities to support our growth, but we'll also continue to manage our costs and ensure we're creating value for our shareholders. We continue to grow faster than the market by focusing on our people and our colleagues and on operational excellence and agility. They deliver every day for our business and for our customers. So we look forward to updating you on the full year and our long-term value proposition and hopefully seeing many of you in San Francisco at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference to kick off 2024. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong third quarter, with broad-based growth across both our U.S. and international segments across both companion animal and lifestyle portfolios and across both price and volume. For the quarter, we were able to deliver results in line with our expectations, even in light of continued headwinds in China. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 7% on a reported basis and 8% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $629 million grew 11% on a reported basis and 13% on an operational basis. Of the 8% operational revenue growth, 5% is from price and 3% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for pain, Librela and Solensia and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth, growing 11% operationally. Livestock also contributed, with operational growth of 3% in the quarter. Companion animal growth was again driven by our innovative products with double-digit operational growth in our key dermatology portfolio, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia and Simparica Trio. Our key dermatology products generated $393 million in sales globally, posting growth of 14% on an operational basis with double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international. Globally, our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain posted $77 million in combined revenue in the quarter. Growth came primarily from our European markets as well as from the impact of new launch markets internationally. With the October full launch of Librela in the U.S., our pain products are now available in most major markets. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $206 million in the quarter, representing growth of 20% operationally versus the comparable 2022 period. Growth was driven by expanded DTC advertising support globally as well as from increased field force and promotional focus. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio reported revenue of $90 million and grew 14% operationally, with growth contributions from both the U.S. and international. Our life sci portfolio grew 3% operationally, with international growth partially offset by a slight decline in the U.S. Growth in livestock was driven primarily by price, especially in high inflationary markets. We also saw volume growth in our poultry portfolio, driven by increased usage of vaccines as well as our antioxodio product, Zoamix in the U.S. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 8%, with companion animal products growing 11% and livestock sales declining 2%. On the companion animal side, while vet clinic visits declined 1.5% in the quarter, we continue to see robust play in revenue growth, up 6% versus a year ago. Average revenue per visit is up over 7%. On a year-to-date basis, clinic visits are flat, while clinic revenue is growing 8%. These trends highlight the continued durability of pet owner willingness to spend as well as the continued impact of vet clinic staffing challenges.  Our companion animal revenue growth continues to outpace veterinary clinic revenue growth, due in part to our continued upsized growth in retail channel. Turning to product performance. Companion animal growth in the U.S. was driven by our key dermatology portfolio, Simparica Trio and Solensia. Key dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $260 million in the quarter, growing 13%. Simparica point sales continued to drive growth in the quarter, with vets showing a preference for injectables due to higher compliance and pet owners appreciating the longer duration of treatment. Apoquel sales were driven by growth in the retail channel as pet owners continue to rely more heavily on retail for ongoing pharmacy needs as well as retail auto ship programs that drive higher compliance. Our latest dermatology life cycle innovation at Apoquel Chewable was launched in the U.S. in October. Apoquel Chewable has been well received in Europe, as pet owners favor the ease of chewable administration over film-coated tablets. Simparica Trio posted U.S. sales of $184 million in the quarter, growing 17%, driven by increased focus in our parasiticide promotional programs. We continue to see patient share growth in Simparica Trio, even with the recent competitive launch in the triple combination space. We remain confident in our ability to compete through our superior label, strong retail channel presence, and the strength of our corporate and specialty relationships. In the U.S., our pain products posted sales of $15 million in the quarter. We continue to see solid player penetration growth for Solensia, as well as an uptick in Feline clinic visits and expect to continue to drive awareness of Feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns. Librela has been well received by early experience program participants and their patients during the third quarter. We moved to a full launch in mid-October. We have been very pleased with post launch performance thus far, and are confident that we have ample supply to meet our demand expectations. Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio posted growth of 18% in the quarter, as we continue to see positive results from the new field force we introduced last year. We saw strong placement growth in the quarter, especially on our images device. U.S. livestock sales declined 2% in the quarter, primarily resulting from the timing of supply on certain cattle products in the prior year, where we had an improved supply position and restocking in the channel, which drove a strong comparable quarter. The Q3 decline was partially offset by growth in our cattle productivity implant, Synovex due to extended label claims. The cattle decline was partially offset by growth in poultry due to vaccines and the extended use of Zoamix, an alternative to antibiotic medicated feed additives. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on both a reported and operational basis in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 12% operationally and livestock grew 5% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, our key dermatology products and our small animal parasiticides portfolio. Growth in our OA pain products was bolstered by field force focus and DTC awareness campaigns in early launch European markets, specifically the U.K. and Germany, as well as the continued uptake in markets launched earlier this year. Librela sales were $50 million international or 55% operational growth in the quarter, despite a slightly more difficult comparator in Q3 of 2022 due to the removal of supply constraints in our international markets. We remain confident in our ability to supply our forecasted demand for Librela. Solensia sales were $12 million in the quarter. Our international key dermatology portfolio contributed $133 million of revenue and grew 17% operationally. We saw double-digit growth across most of our major markets and strong uptake of Apoquel Chewable. Apoquel growth was driven primarily by the delayed itch season in Europe and Canada. Cytopoint growth was driven by continued patient expansion and higher compliance in existing patients. Our international small animal are parasiticides portfolio growth of 9% operationally was driven by our Simparica franchise, with Simparica posting $40 million in revenue, growing 29% operationally, driven primarily by demand generation in emerging markets. Simparica Trio posted $23 million, growing 47% on an operational basis, driven by growth in corporate account contracts. The Simparica franchise performance was partially offset by a 16% operational decline in Revolution franchise, driven by a difficult comparable period in China, due to the return of supply in the prior year as well as the ongoing impact of the current economic conditions. As Kristin mentioned, we have seen declines in China due to the ongoing economic challenges, particularly on the companion animal side, which were not fully reflected in our initial guidance. We continue to monitor economic conditions. However, we are not expecting an improvement this year or into the first half of next year. Our international livestock segment grew 5% operationally in the quarter, driven primarily by price increases, especially in high inflationary markets. Growth was driven primarily by our cattle portfolio, which grew 8% operationally. Brazil was the largest contributor, where we have seen price growth, supply recovery on certain products as well as continued improvement in cattle industry dynamics. Additionally, the prior was a weak comparative period due to the impact of supply disruptions and a more uncertain industry dynamic led to a lowering of channel inventories in the quarter. Our poultry business also contributed to growth in the quarter, growing 9% operationally due to increased key account penetration in emerging markets. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 70.5% improved 70 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of price increases and lower freight charges. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, inventory charges and product mix. Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% operationally, driven primarily by higher SG&A expenses, which were 5% operationally due to higher competition related expenses. R&D expenses grew 13% on an operational basis in the quarter, driven by higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased project spend for our pipeline projects. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.6%, a decrease of 130 basis points due to favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings and a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income, partially offset by lower net discrete tax benefits. And finally, adjusted net income was 13% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 15% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $145 million. We now expect full year capital expenditures to be in the range of $725 million to $750 million. In the quarter, we repurchased $250 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October, which reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Beginning with revenue for the full year. Due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, we are revising our reported revenue range while narrowing our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.475 billion and $8.55 billion, with a range of 6.5% to 7.5% operational growth. Our previous guidance was 6% to 8%. We have been pleased with our operational performance thus far. While foreign exchange headwinds have been larger than expected, our year-to-date operational revenue growth of 7% is in line with our expectations. We expect to benefit from the approval and launch of Librela in the U.S., which is included in our revised guidance last quarter as well as the performance of our Lifestyle business. However, ongoing uncertainty in China has continued to offset upside potential. We are expecting adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.51 billion, also slightly lower, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. Operationally, we are narrowing our growth expectations to a range of 7.5% to 8.5%, previously 7% to 9%. Expected reported diluted EPS narrows to a range of $5.14 to $5.21. And adjusted diluted EPS narrows to $5.38 to $5.43. Finally, to summarize before we go to Q&A. Our broad-based growth across species and geographies despite the challenging economic environment in China, continue to highlight the resilience of our portfolio and of the animal health industry. We remain committed to growing above the industry, driven by our innovative portfolio, commercial execution and multiple sources of in-line growth. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Yes, absolutely. Look, the 11% growth operationally in companion animal is right in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. And the overall growth of 8% operational, I would even say, is slightly above. If you recall on the last call, we said expect Q3 to come in somewhere between the mid and the high end of our growth rate. So that's roughly between 7% and 8%, so at the high end of that.  But in terms of consumer, look, as we've said time and time again, if you look at the therapeutics category in terms of the value in pet health as well as some of the chronic conditions, as Kristin mentioned, consumers have not been treating those as discretionary. Even when you see some relative softness in pet spend, it doesn't carry over into the health care piece in terms of therapeutics, et cetera. And we've seen that play out in many ways even as I'm sure we'll get into a -- clinic visits are slightly down in the quarter. Clinic revenue is up almost 7%, and we're growing faster than that. Again, retail being a part of that, and we'll get into that in a little bit more detail. When I look at the big products, as you described them, John, derm, Triomabs, all up double digits and up across U.S. and international. I mean our growth this quarter was broad-based, across companion animal livestock U.S. international price, 5% volume on 3%. So really broad-based. And I think that really underscores the breadth of our products as well as our innovation and the value that consumer and pet owners place on products. The legacy products, when I look at in line, keep in mind, when we talk price, we tend to see price lift in those legacy products as well. But when it volume, it wasn't down. In-line products were actually flat on the quarter year-on-year with some lift on price. So hopefully, that helps. But I share the optimism Kristin described with respect to 2024. I mean we have multiple sources of growth, not only the Librela launch in the U.S. You've got continued growth across international markets for Librela and Solensia as well. And of course, we'll have price as a lever in addition to in-line products we just talked about. Livestock is now back to growth, and we'll look at what that looks like when we come back with guidance next year. And then we expect growth across our key franchises as well in terms of derm, paris and diagnostics. So I'll cap it there as a long answer to a long question, but we'll take the next one. Sure. I will. Look, you're right, Erin. In terms of -- as we said, when you look at ABS at peak, once they ramp up, they will be additive and accretive to our gross margins. We believe they're also accretive to our contribution margin, even when there are what I'll say is subscale in terms of getting towards their peak. So as we launch into the U.S., which is a large market, obviously, as you said, we'll see a little bit of a headwind from a gross margin perspective. But given many of the investments that we need to drive this field force, et cetera, already in the books, if you will. There will be some incremental A&P and DTC. And once we have the right level of penetration of the product in clinics, but that's still going to leave room for contribution margin lift in the product. So that will be, I would say, a factor from a gross margin standpoint. But we'll give more precision in terms of guidance for '24 at the next call. But as you can read from us and what we're saying today, we're very excited about '24. We're optimistic on '24, given the levers I just described. So in line with what we said at Investor Day, we expect to grow in the mid- to high single digits. I think you'll continue to see us look for margin expansion given the mix up in companion animal versus large [indiscernible], but I won't give you any more and more specific than that. Yes, absolutely. Look, if you look at Librela, we delivered $53 million in revenues in Q3. That's a 65% growth operationally. Now if you look at the preexisting markets, they were up about 33%. So that's an incremental $10 million or $11 million in the quarter year-on-year growth in the pre-existing markets. And then new markets that have been launched this year is about $10 million that includes a little bit from the U.S. from the early experience program. So year-on-year growth and then sequentially, I think was your question, and we're still up a few million sequentially. Just keep in mind, Q3 last year, as we said, we have a bit of a tougher comp for Q3, because that's when we released sort of the allocations that we're on and the supply constraints. So that is factoring a little bit, but we still had 33% in the in the EU sort of locations in markets where we had previously launched. So that's still a very robust growth despite the comp. Yes, absolutely. Look, as Kristin just said, we remain on target with our regulatory milestones with respect to R&D spend was up about 13% year-over-year on the quarter. So clearly, well above our revenue growth rate. So what you're seeing in terms of our overall expectations for the year versus where we're landing is just a matter of timing on the span of gross projects, but nothing significant or notable there. Again, we continue to drive innovation, both across new innovation as well as life cycle innovation across our portfolio, and we're very excited about the progress we're making in R&D. Yes, sure. Look, on Trio, I think you covered it well, $206 million of revenue in the quarter. That's up 20% operationally. We're very pleased with that, including the patient share gains that Kristin already described. On CapEx, yes, we did reduce our CapEx expectations for the year from about $950 million to $1 billion down to $725 million to $750 million. This is really on timing of project spend. We remain committed to the investments that we're making. And this is still representing about a 25% increase in CapEx year-over-year. So as we said at Investor Day, excise CapEx to remain elevated for the next couple of years, and then we'll start to bring that down sort of in the range of a growth rate that approximates our revenue growth range as you go beyond '24, \u201825-time frame. So again, really just don't matter of timing is what you're seeing from a CapEx standpoint. Yes, I'll be happy to take that. Look, we continue to see, as you saw this quarter, 11% operational growth in companion animal. And though we have some tough comps, as Kristin just referenced with the Trio answer on previous question, we are expecting very, very strong growth across companion animal. And keep in mind, we have some comp challenges with respect to livestock, which will decelerate from what it is on a year-to-date basis, about 6% to a low single-digit growth. So as you look at what's factored into the guidance that we just gave in narrowing the range, but still maintaining our midpoint, if you will, you can factor that into your equation in terms of what the livestock versus companion animal mix is as we exit the year. No, I think you covered the macro dynamics well, Kristin. On the supply question with respect to Librela, we are very confident in our supply plans to meet the demand expectations for Librela that we have certainly for '24 and beyond. Mentioning the Lincoln facility, certainly in addition to both our internal capacity and third party that we are using, we continue to invest internally. And I think if you look at Lincoln that will be a factor, particularly as you go beyond 2024, with respect to supply planning fully well and other maps as well. So again, very confident in our ability to meet those demand expectations, and we've already factored the ramp that we saw in Europe in our thinking around demand there as well. Yes, sure. The only thing I would add on the vet clinic visits is you see our growth continues to outpace that of the clinic growth. And the vet visits were not as they're important, right? But we're not as sensitive to visit because therapeutics and chronic indications tend to power through that. And you can still see volume growth even as visits are down. And then the retail piece, which is continuing to grow. We've seen an additional 24% points as a percentage of our pet care revenues in the U.S. each year. So we've gone from 11% from about 5% just a few years ago. So we continue to see that in the quarter, it was up about 35%, if you look at our retail sales. So those are the factors I would add. With respect to the cattle dynamics and livestock in general, I would say clearly, we've had a very strong start to the year through the first 9 months. Livestock is up about 6%. Clearly, we're signaling that will come down in the fourth quarter. And that's really more of a factor of variability across quarters, given the timing of supply that we've had in the prior year versus the current year. The timing of when we've taken price adjustments for Jackson, for example, which impacted Q2 versus Q3 as well as Q4 this year as we're anticipating a step in that -- at the end of the year. So that will put some more pressure on Q4. We factored all that into our guidance that we've just issued today, which we are still in line with our expectations that we started the year with, which is right around our midpoint, we just narrowed it. So all those are in. With respect to capital dynamics around, we haven't seen anything that would say there's a pronounced shift with respect to the cattle run here. But again, we factored all these items into our thinking and what we've just iterated today from a guidance standpoint. Yes. Look, I'm not sure if I got the second question, but I'm going to give it a shot and then ask you to clarify. On the parasiticides market, we still estimate in terms of volume, nearly half is still in the collars and topicals, but from a value perspective dollars, we're significantly leaning on the calls and prescription. As those are at higher price points. I think you're asking a specific question about share for specific products within the topicals and collars and I don't have that to hand. But if it was a different question, I'll ask you to clarify after I give you an answer on Librela. So Librela, in the third quarter was minimal. As you know, in September, we had an early experience program. That was only about 400 clinics very limited with KOLs to get them using the product and being able to talk about it, et cetera, and helping with refining protocols and so on. And so the number was like $3 million in the quarter, not meaningful at all. And given the timing of the full launch in October and with the holidays coming, it is not going to have a meaningful impact on the full year growth again on that point. But I'll ask you to clarify if I didn't get the question right on Paris."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company\u2019s 8-K filing dated today, Tuesday, August 8, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call for 2023. I hope you were able to join us or listen to our Investor Day this past May. If you missed it, please checkout our replay on zoetis.com. I think you will find it worth the time in learning more about Zoetis and where we see future growth in animal health. We appreciated the opportunity to step beyond the cadence of our quarterly earnings call and speak to about the long range perspective on our business and on our industry during Investor Day. We also appreciated your questions and the ongoing dialogue about the issues most important to you. As you know, we shared more detail about our growth strategy, innovative pipelines, and the key franchises, capabilities and investments we are making to build on our competitive advantages as the world leader in animal health. The four tenets of our value proposition were affirmed and expanded on throughout the day, and you can expect us to revisit that framework and provide progress updates in future investor interactions. Our goal is always to ensure that you understand how we are positioned to deliver on our value proposition, the revenue growth, strategic investments, margin expansion and capital returns. With that covered, let's turn now to the second quarter financial results. Today, we reported strong second quarter results of 9% operational growth in revenue and 12% operational growth in adjusted net income based on our diverse portfolio across markets and species. As expected, we return to a more balanced segment growth this quarter with 11% operational growth internationally, and 7% growth in the U.S. Our companion animal portfolio grew 11% operationally, driven by our major franchises in dermatology, osteoarthritis pain and pet parasiticides. The second quarter results and drivers were more in line with our performance trends in recent years, with innovations and strength in our companion animal portfolio leading the way. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 4% operationally in the second quarter, driven by sales of poultry, cattle and fish products, and continue to demonstrate the benefits of our diversified portfolio across species and geographies with a strong first half. Overall, the first half of 2023 has played out much as we expected. We have grown revenue 6% operationally in the first half, driven by strong results from our international markets and livestock performance, which were partially offset by the distributor destocking we explained in the first quarter. As expected, the impact of distributor destocking in our U.S companion animal portfolio has stabilized and was not a significant factor in the second quarter. We continue to see strong customer demand for our companion animal portfolio. For the first half of 2023, companion animal grew 5% operationally. We believe companion animal should be a bigger driver of performance for the remainder of the year with a stronger second half driven by our key franchises. While we are monitoring how inflationary pressures may impact pet care spending in markets around the world, the underlying demand has remained steady and resilient to date, and this is what we have seen historically. In the U.S., veterinary clinic visits continue to stabilize staying relatively flat through the first half of the year, and clinic revenue and spend per visit were both up about 9% in the U.S in the first half. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally in the first half of 2023, reflecting strong growth internationally and continued supply recovery in our U.S cattle products. We expect live -- livestock growth for the full year to be in the low single digits operationally, reflecting tougher comparisons in the second half of the year for our U.S portfolio. With the first half of the year playing out largely as expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue, and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income, at our companion animal portfolio we expect Librela and Solensia to continue to ramp up in various markets as we build our franchise for osteoarthritis pain. One way we are supporting growth for both products is increased use of direct-to-consumer campaigns in launch markets. These campaigns are building disease and product awareness, creating conversations among vets and pet owners and accelerating our efforts in markets where DTC is available. We're also pleased to have received U.S regulatory approvals in the second quarter for Librela and for Apoquel Chewable. Both have been performing well in markets outside the U.S to date. Librela is expected to launch in the U.S in November with an early experience trial beginning in September. As we look at the second half, we continue to expect strong growth, even as we factor in uncertainty around the macroeconomic conditions and drought that exists in certain countries around the globe, particularly Asia Pacific, and tougher comparisons for U.S livestock portfolio in the U.S. As we have seen historically in these types of environments, our global footprint and diverse portfolio provide more stability to our business during uncertain times. And we remain ready to pivot resources and investments to the greatest opportunity areas that it can ensure we continue to deliver on our commitments. For example, we continue to expand in large and growing product areas, such as parasiticide, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies for pain, vaccines and diagnostics, and invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, many of which we discussed at Investor Day. Before I wrap up, three quick points around our colleagues. First, I want to welcome Ester Banque to our Zoetis Executive Team as EVP and President of U.S Operations. Ester joined us in July coming most recently from Bristol Myers Squibb, and having spent a major part of her career at Novartis as well. She brings diverse global experience in health care, and an impressive track record of driving results to Zoetis. And I'm happy to say she is already off and running with the U.S business. I also wanted to call out the recent publication of our 2022 sustainability report. This year's report captures how sustainability is integrated across the business and shares the progress we are making toward are driven to care aspirations. This report honors our outstanding Zoetis colleagues who champion our purpose and work every day to make us the world's most trusted and valued animal health company. And finally, I wanted to mention a recent recognition from Fast Company, which names Zoetis as one of the Best Workplaces for Innovators. Shaping animal care through innovation is something we've always done across the company, and it's been a key element of our success. This is a well deserved honor for our culture, and our people who continuously strive to solve critical unmet medical needs in animal health from chronic illnesses, like osteoarthritis pain and allergic dermatitis for pets to emerging infectious diseases, threatening the food supply. I'm truly proud of our colleagues for receiving this recognition. In conclusion, with a solid first half behind us, I remain very positive about achieving our full year guidance, thanks to the purpose driven colleagues, innovation driven culture and diverse portfolio that continue to drive our success. Thank you. And now let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with balanced growth across both our companion animal and livestock portfolios, as well as our U.S and international segments. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $652 million were 15% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 4% is from price and 5% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from other in-line products, 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Companion animal products are the primary driver of growth this quarter, growing 11% operationally with livestock growing 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. For companion animal, our key dermatology portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting $355 million in revenue, our largest quarter ever and representing 14% growth on an operational basis. We saw double-digit operational growth in both international and the U.S. driven by strong growth in Cytopoint as well as growth driven by Apoquel and the conversion to Apoquel Chewable in certain international markets. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $69 million in revenue globally in the quarter with strong demand for both products as well as the impact of the launch of Librela in several new international markets. Our companion animal parasiticides also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by our Revolution franchise, which had $103 million in revenue and grew 22% operationally. Simparica Trio also contributed to the parasiticide growth with $248 million of revenue and growth of 5% operationally. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $92 million in revenue in Q2, growing 12% operationally. We saw double-digit growth in the U.S. driven by high instrument placements in the quarter and disruptions from the implementation of our new field force model that impacted the prior year. Sales of our livestock products grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw growth across both our U.S. and international segments driven by poultry, cattle and fish. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal products growing 7% and livestock sales growing 5%. As Kristen mentioned, our companion animal performance in the quarter reflects the stabilization of the distributor inventory levels that were a headwind to our growth in Q1. U.S. vet visits were flat in the quarter. [Indiscernible] revenue growth and average revenue per visit were both up 8%. These trends are in line with expectations and continue to reflect the stabilization post-COVID. Turning to U.S. product performance. Our key dermatology product sales were $241 million for the quarter, growing 10% and benefited from higher periodic patient visits in the quarter. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth with vets and pet owners showing a preference for injectables. Our U.S. small animal vaccines revenue grew 20% in the quarter, driven by higher sales of our canine influenza virus vaccine due in part to a competitor back order as well as higher sales into certain corporate and strategic accounts. Apoquel Chewable posted sales of $213 million in the quarter, growing 2%. Growth was driven by inpatient demand across all channels, partially offset by a difficult comparison period given the timing of distributor shipments from last year during our supply challenges as well as aggressive competitive promotion in the current quarter. Our growth cadence for Trio across the year will be impacted by the timing of supply recovery in 2022, and we expect growth rate improvement in the second half. As expected, we received FDA approval for Librela in the U.S. in May. We look forward to starting our early experience program in late Q3 with an expected November launch. Now turning to U.S. livestock. We saw 5% growth in our livestock portfolio in the quarter, primarily from our cattle business where we saw significant growth in Jackson, resulting from a favorable comparative quarter last year when an anticipated midyear price reduction limited sales in the quarter. Additional U.S. cattle growth came from Synovex, which benefited from our reimplementation label claim. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also contributed to growth of 11% based on our vaccine portfolio and an increased focus on egg layer market. We also benefited from favorable MFA rotations at certain large producers. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue was $1 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally in the quarter, while livestock revenue grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our small animal parasiticides, our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and our key dermatology products. Our international parasiticide portfolio growth was primarily driven by a revolution franchise with $57 million in revenue, growing 52% operationally driven by the lack of supply last year, which particularly impacted China in the second quarter of 2022. Our Simparica franchise also contributed to growth with continued market share expansion, especially in Latin America, Europe and Asia. We continue to see strong adoption of Librela and Solensia. Librela generated $48 million in revenue with 89% operational growth in the quarter driven by strong growth in Europe, supported by our direct-to-consumer advertising efforts in major markets and recent launches in various international markets, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan. Solensia delivered $11 million of second quarter sales internationally, driven by higher demand and supported by direct-to-consumer marketing efforts. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 22% operationally. We continue to see double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by growth from and conversion to Apoquel Chewable as well as from Cytopoint with higher compliance and new patients. Our growth also benefited from a weak comparative quarter in Japan, which was impacted by pre-priced buy ups in Q1 of last year. Moving on to our international livestock portfolio, which grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our poultry portfolio performed well with growth driven by key account penetration and MFA rotations in core poultry markets, including Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Our fish portfolio continues to perform well as a result of increased sales of vaccines across salmon markets in Norway and Chile. Lastly, our cattle portfolio saw gains in Turkey, Brazil and Argentina from strong price growth and the recovery of supply issues. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 72.4% improved 260 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from favorable foreign exchange, price increases and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally with both SG&A and R&D growing 8% operationally driven primarily by headcount-related compensation costs due to the timing of new hires in 2022 and the impact of annual salary increases. The lower growth in R&D expenses this quarter is reflective of the timing of spend in project investments and not a reduction in our expected R&D spend for the full year. Year-to-date, adjusted R&D expenses has grown 13% operationally. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, an increase of 80 basis points, driven by higher net discrete tax expenses in the quarter, mainly related to changes to prior year's tax positions and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income grew 12% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% operationally in the quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $166 million and continue to be on track with our expectations for the year. In the quarter, we repurchased $324 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July, beginning with revenue for the full year due to unfavorable foreign exchange we are slightly lowering our revenue range while maintaining our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.50 billion and $8.65 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. With the approval of Librela in the U.S., we are now including our projected sales for November and December in our guidance, which are expected to be immaterial to our overall operational growth rate. Their impact on the full year revenue is largely offset by potential uncertainty in China as well as broader macroeconomic conditions in certain markets. Operationally, the first half has played out largely as we expected with 6% operational revenue growth. We expect stronger growth in the second half of the year overall, especially in our U.S. companion animal business. In livestock, which has grown 8% year-to-date on an operational basis. We anticipate unfavorable comparisons in the second half, driven by the timing of price decreases in Jackson in the U.S. last year, and the resumption of supply of several products after outages in the first half of 2022. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.50 billion to $2.55 billion, slightly above our previous guidance while maintaining our previous guidance of operational growth of 7% to 9%, driven by foreign exchange favorability in cost of sales and expenses, which were partially offset by unfavorability in revenue. Reported diluted EPS increases to a range of $5.15 to $5.27, which is impacted by foreign exchange and a one-time gain from a business development deal. And finally, due to the impact of foreign exchange, we are increasing adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.37 to $5.47. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we saw strong well based growth in the second quarter, growing in both companion animal and livestock as well as in the U.S. and internationally, with contributions from price and volume. We expect stronger growth as we move into the second half. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our operational full year guidance commitments. We continue to see improving fundamentals in the overall industry and remain committed to delivering on our value proposition to grow revenue faster than the market and to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter, Kristen and Wetteny. I want to start with Trio real quickly. We've seen -- we finally see NexGard Plus in the U.S. from Boehringer Ingelheim. I just want to ask, how do you see this market playing out? There's a lot of debate on the label differences Trio versus NexGard Plus, the 6 month versus 1 month warm detail as well as how it's going to be priced with the promotions being put out at the start of the launch. So what are your expectations for Trio now that the competition is finally here both for second half and for 2024. And if I could squeeze in a follow-up. I want to ask on Librela. It continues to be really well OUS. I think it's on track for over 200 million this year from OUS alone. Any learnings or changes to your assumptions now that you can take that into the U.S. launch. Fair to say that it could be incremental 75 million, 100 million to revenue next year? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll start with the first question and let Wetteny follow-up on Librela. Yes, as we saw the -- this was the label for NexGard Plus was largely what we expected. I think Simparica Trio clearly has a superior label, and it was first to market. Right now Simparica Trio is #1 in companion animal [indiscernible] in the U.S. As you look at where we are, we've had 3 years of demonstrated efficacy and experience with this product. And we'll clearly leverage our retail auto ship to continue that. As you look at NexGard Plus, it obviously does not, as you saw, have heartworm from first dose -- it has 4 ticks versus 5. It doesn't yet have a label to prevent line. It has a lower minimum weight. So we really do think we have a strength in our Simparica Trio label will be aggressive, obviously, in competing against them. We are expecting a much stronger Q3 for the product based on comparable. So we expect a strong second half for us. We are expecting significant promos. We watch them do this before. This is something BI does often. So beyond the promos, we think we can be very competitive with our product based on the strength of our label, the strength of the experience with the product. Our relationships clearly with the corporates and really with a very pleased pet owner who's on this product. So obviously, we're ready for some significant competition, but we remain very confident overall and our strength in [indiscernible], and we see a stronger growth obviously in the next quarter and the second half for [indiscernible] overall. But Wetteny, do you want to take this question on Librela?\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. Mike, thanks for the question. Look, we remain really on track with EU performance, and we are very pleased to see $48 million of Librela revenues in the quarter, up 89% versus the prior year. We also launched a product in a number of new markets in our International segment including Japan, Australia, Brazil and Canada. Those contributed about $10 million for the quarter. So we continue to see really strong demand for the product, and we are starting to initiate DTC campaigns, which will continue to drive awareness across both Librela and Solensia in our markets. It is already, as we said last year, the #1 osteoarthritis pain product in the EU. Look, we won't necessarily get into what the expectations are for next year. Obviously, we'll do that as we get into guidance for the year. We are expecting to continue to see strong growth for Librela on the balance of the year. I will note, last year, we did see a bit of an uptick in the third quarter. That was, as we released the allocations that we are on, and we saw clinics order a bit more, that was offset in Q4. So just a little bit of a dynamic in Q3 and Q4. But really with the new markets as well as continued growth in EU, we are expecting very strong growth in the third quarter as well.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. First, Wetteny, I wanted to start with the outlook for companion. I think you had talked about it improving in the back half of the year. Was that relative to the 5% growth in the first half? Or is that relative to the second quarter growth, which is obviously higher. Any context you can kind of provide as well on just kind of cadence through Q2 versus 4Q would be helpful. And then just a follow-up on the commentary on Trio. Could you maybe just talk about the 2% operational growth and the different factors that impacted that in the quarter and then the kind of type of growth that you would expect in the back half of the year, just given the competitive launch that you mentioned as well as maybe a normalization of supply.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, I'd be happy to take this and see what Kristin wants to add. With respect to companion animal, as we said, and I think you saw us really reiterate our guidance from an operational perspective 6% to 8%. Now while livestock has seen about 8% growth in the first half, we saw 4% growth in livestock in the second quarter operationally. We are expecting -- as we said in the prepared commentary, livestock to come in, in the low single-digit range. So I think you can clearly see that the growth in the back half of the year is going to be significantly driven by companion animal. And as we said also, given the timing of supply in 2022, we are facing -- relatively speaking, an easier comp in the U.S. companion animal business in the third quarter versus, say, the fourth quarter. So I think those will play out in terms of how you get -- how you map out to our guidance on an operational perspective, being largely driven by companion animal in the back half of the year. I think overall, not just from a companion animal perspective, overall, I would expect the third quarter to be another strong quarter for us. I would expect us to come in somewhere between the mid and high-end of our annual range. We said after last quarter, given the distributor destocking impact to a normalized growth for the rest of the year which would translate to somewhere -- if you just pick the midpoint of our guidance, that will be around 8%. We came in slightly above that, really in line with our expectations on the quarter. And so you can map out what that means for the rest of the year, but I would expect Q3 to be slightly above Q4 given what I just shared from a companion animal perspective versus less like that has a tougher comp in the third quarter, particularly in the U.S. Trio, like Kristin said, we are starting [ph] very strong quarter in third quarter despite the competitive launch, which we believe to be imminent here. Part of that is the cadence last year. I think the rhythm of supply last year clearly had an impact where we saw a bigger Q2 last year than in Q3. So I think you're going to see that play out with respect to the Trio growth. And given the first mover advantages that we have with Trio that's been in the market for over 3 years and our confidence in terms of our label, et cetera, we expect to see continued growth across Trio and a strong year for the year for Trio.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel.\nJon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll [indiscernible] the front. I guess the first one, just any color on the gross margin. Wetteny, I think the 2Q '23 gross margin, I believe, might have been the best in the company's history. So maybe you could talk about the drivers there and more importantly, are some of those drivers sustainable? And then the second question might build a little bit on a prior question, which is, is Trio the modest, call it, downside driver of the implied companion animal '23 growth? Because I think I've got it right. Essentially, livestock went from flattish to up low single digits. Obviously, overall operational stayed unchanged at 6% to 8%. So the implied CA came down a bit. Do we think about Trio being responsible for that? And maybe just a byproduct of some of the promotions that you called out earlier? Thanks for your time.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, with respect to gross margin, you saw 72.4% gross margin on the quarter in Q2. That's up about 260 basis points versus last year. FX is about 200 basis points of that. And clearly, we've pegged our overall guidance on FX based on where rates were at the end of July. So I'm not going to venture to forecast what that might mean. But in terms of the other components that are driving our gross margin, price and mix, certainly were favorable for us. And as we've just discussed with respect to livestock having a tougher comp in the back half versus companion animal particularly into the third quarter, we expect price mix to continue to contribute favorably here. The other element, of course, is really manufacturing -- higher manufacturing costs. I think typically what you see is this first half is a little bit higher for us than the second half. Part of that is the mix with respect to cattle run in the fall that tends to have a little bit of a mix down on us overall. But I would say the overall mix for the company, given the back half strength in companion animal is going to be -- continue to be favorable. So we see that being something that will consistently sustain. And again, we won't get into next year's element until we get there. With respect to the second half, look, clearly, our expectations with Trio remain that we'll see strong growth contribution for Trio and we are going to see a very strong third quarter. I think some of the -- and by the way, the year has played out, as we said, we gave a range of 6% to 8% operationally, sitting here today after delivering a very strong second quarter, we remain in line with our expectations for the year at 6% to 8%. I think if you look at some of the areas that we're watching from a macro perspective, China is one of them. I think if you look at the data coming out of China, confidence levels for consumers are low, the savings rates are very high. And so we're watching that as well as the impact it has on the Southeast Asia region given the tourism impact that China has on that region. That's one of the areas. Certainly, we are watching here in terms of what goes into our thinking with respect to the balance of the year.\nKristin Peck: Yes, I just want to reiterate, it is not -- I would not call Trio what is driving any change in the second half. I really want to emphasize what Wetteny said and what we said in our remarks. It really is, as we are looking at uncertainties with China, Southeast Asia, Australia with the drought. So I mean, as always, when you run a large global company, I think the advantage of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio and the durability. And that's by market, that's by species, and that's by therapeutic area. So we are obviously seeing strength in a lot of areas, but obviously, uncertainties remain in China, Southeast Asia and certainly in some other markets around the world, certain ones such as if you look at, say, at Spain, et cetera, which has got high inflation and weather issues as well. So I would say, I just want to be very clear. I don't think your characterization of Trio specifically repairs is the concern in the second half. It is much more around some of these macroeconomic and geopolitical and whether uncertainties that we're seeing in certain markets.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Westenberg with Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So can you talk about the derm market in 2024? I'm not talking necessarily, but you're specifically -- but how you expect growth in monoclonals versus growth in small molecule with an incoming competitor. And if I could just squeeze in one really short one. Just want to confirm, Librela U.S. is not in the 2023 guidance. Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I can start with your second. Yes, Librela U.S. is in, as we did note, obviously, in Wetteny's remarks. But to get to your question on derm and Wetteny can certainly follow-up with you once on the derm question -- on the Librela question. But we have led the way, as you know, in dermatology with both a small molecule and large molecule. We've been driving awareness through DTC. We still think there's significant market potential here in developed and emerging markets. There's still plenty of dogs that are untreated here. We are really focusing on investing in direct-to-consumer branded in the U.S. and in some markets and unbranded outside. With that, if you're seeing this year, we are looking at double-digit growth. In Q2, we had 14% growth with double-digit growth in both products in the quarter, so real strength. And we are continuing to innovate here. I think you saw also approval for Apoquel-2 in the U.S. We will look for long-acting Cytopoint, look at species, we are expecting obviously competition. We've been expecting it for a while. We'll say again, we're expecting it in 2024, and we'll see what happens. But we really are seeing more of a preference from both the vet and the pet owner moving more to Cytopoint for compliance reasons, obviously, for EE [ph]. So I think we'll continue to see that. So we are seeing very strong growth in dermatology. Again, we are expecting double digits for the year. In the quarter, we had great strength against both, but I would like to be clear that as we are seeing do we think will grow faster. We are seeing greater focus from the vet and the pet owner on Cytopoint being a greater driver of our overall dermatology franchise, but really expect to follow that up with strong innovation continuing in what we think is a really important space, Wetteny do you want to add anything on derma's question or Librela?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, I think clearly, a really strong quarter for us in derm in the second quarter, and we are expecting another strong quarter and strong back half for derm across and clearly Cytopoint driving that as well. Just with respect to Librela, I just wanted to add a little bit of color in terms of our thinking there. Certainly, very pleased to have received approval in May. But really, consistent with our expectations, we've been sharing for the last, I think, 2 or 3 quarters, we've been expecting an approval to be -- to come in the first half of this year followed by an early experience program and then the launch late in the year is what we've been saying. We remain on track with that. We are planning to begin the early experience program next month with the launch to follow somewhere in the November time frame. Given the holidays and what's typically a little bit slower time frame with respect to clinics, et cetera, we're not expecting the contribution here to be significant to the growth for the year. And look, we continue to see great performance outside the U.S., and we are launching in other markets as well in line with our expectations as I shared a little bit earlier with an 89% growth rate on Librela on the quarter. And so we have factored that into the guidance here, but again, not a significant contribution.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.\nBrandon Vazquez: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just first on EPS and guidance. I just wanted to clarify the beat was pretty strong in the quarter, I think about $0.09 relative to the industry [ph]. EPS at the midpoint for guidance came up 3 points and just clarify, is that entirely the delta between those two? Is that entirely FX? Or is there anything else there we should be keeping in mind? And then as we think of the rest of the year kind of following up on that guidance, I think you said 4% pricing in the quarter. Can you just remind us when some of these pricing increases came in? Does the benefit of pricing kind of slow down in the back half? And does that imply any improvements in volume and guidance? Thanks.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, happy to answer. Look, as we said, we really reflected two things in our guidance today is, as we said, in fact, last quarter, FX was an area that we are watching, given the volatility that we are seeing across certain currencies that we operate in. And so we've updated guidance for FX both at the revenue line, which is negative. About -- it's about 75 basis points of growth essentially on a reported basis, that's impacting FX. So we reflected that here. But it's actually a positive contribution when you come down to EPS to the [indiscernible] $0.03. So what you're seeing there from an adjusted basis is really all FX. From a reported standpoint, we're also reflecting some gains that we saw from a couple of DB [ph] deals that are elevating the reported rate from an EPS perspective. The only other color I would ask -- add here with respect to the second half from the cadence is, again, we are expecting a very strong second half from a companion animal perspective versus livestock with the comps. I think if you look at the third quarter, we probably saw a bit lower OpEx in the prior year versus the fourth quarter. So I would expect OpEx will also be a little bit higher in Q3 versus Q4 as you look at the balance of the year. But other than that, I think price is something we typically do early in the year. There are certain markets where we may do a midyear price increase as well. But overall, price is something that happens fairly early in the year and pretty consistent with what you've seen in our numbers today.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thank you so much. This is [indiscernible] on for Chris. So first question, on dermatology, can you just remind us where you are in terms of life cycle management? Any additional color that you kind of see with the dermatology portfolio kind of evolving over the next several years in terms of maybe potential new mechanisms or mode of administration. And then the second question is on Europe. You obviously had a very strong quarter for companion ex U.S. this quarter. Can you just elaborate a bit on the trends that you're seeing there and how you see them holding up in the second half of the year? Thank you so much.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, [indiscernible]. I'll take your questions and see what Wetteny wants to build on it. Life cycle innovation, obviously, is critical in dermatology. We're quite focused on it in a number of areas. I think you saw approval in May of -- or in the quarter of Apoquel Chewable which we had approved outside the U.S., but now got approved in the U.S. This is really important for a lot of pet owners who have trouble getting their dogs to take pills. So a chewable has real value there. We are also looking at monoclonal antibodies, looking at more long acting in that space. We are also looking at life cycle innovation around other species. Clearly, dermatology is a significant issue amongst many companion animals. So we'll continue to look for opportunities there. It is a big market. We will continue to lead in innovation and in life cycle innovation across a number of different areas. I said, from small molecules to monoclonal antibodies to additional species. So we are really focused there. As you look at Europe, I mean, I think for most companies that we say, the growth in Europe was ahead of what many of us expected for the year, mostly because I think we were expecting energy to be a much bigger issue certainly through the winter, et cetera. But we've seen a great strength, particularly in Northern Europe. But I would say that if you look at Southern Europe, I don't think it's performing as well as Northern Europe. They've got greater inflationary markets there as well as a number of weather issues with severe heat waves and drought across markets like Spain. But we really see the underlying demand in Europe and Northern Europe remaining strong, and we are seeing strong growth there. So I'm not sure, Wetteny, if you want to build on any of those comments.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, I think just stepping back from a companion animal performance perspective, we've continued to see strength there across our international markets. Even in emerging markets, just in Poland recently you're seeing a real uptick in terms of companion animal continuing to take hold. I think some of the innovation that we have may take some time to take hold in other markets outside the U.S. and it takes longer to get to those peak sales. We are continuing to see really strong derm growth across our international markets and so on. So we believe that is sustainable. The first half, we've seen really strong growth there in terms of companion animal. Across international, we saw 17% operational growth in companion animal in the quarter following a 10% growth in Q1. I would continue to expect double-digit growth, maybe not at the level we saw in Q2 in the back half for international, we continue to see double-digit growth there.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor. Louise, your line is unmuted. Please go ahead with your question.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you some of the pushes and pulls to your commitment to the mid to high single-digit revenue growth that you've talked about over the next 3 to 5 years? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Louise. We remain committed to the guidance we provided at Investor Day back in May. We really -- I would start with just the resiliency of the animal health industry. The industry itself, historically, as you know, grows at 4% to 6%. We see really strong tailwinds driving the industry over the next medium to long-term, increasing medicalization, especially in emerging markets, increases in population, really, the strength of the human animal bond. We are seeing increasing willingness to pay with 86% of pet owners say they'll pay whatever it takes to take care of their pet. But really where I think it differentiates Zoetis' innovation. Our innovation across chronic diseases. We look at -- what we can do as we talked about some of our new franchises that we think we will build over that time period as well. We look at an increasing global population, which is obviously driving the need for more sustainable ways of producing agriculture and meats and proteins, so we really think Zoetis will continue to outperform a market growing 4% to 6%. Historically, we've outperformed close to 3%. Zoetis is well diversified, and we are the innovation leader. We've got strong franchises today that are continuing to grow. Dermatology to be set, again this year are growing double-digit, parasiticides, OA pain, we've got strong diagnostics, emerging markets. So we really believe the industry is very attractive and very resilient. But most importantly, I think Zoetis as a leader in innovation will continue to drive this important space.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. And Balaji, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Balaji. Thanks for taking our question. A quick one on the global parasiticide market. On the Investor Day, you expect the global parasiticide market to expand from 6.3 billion in 2022 to around 10 billion to 12 billion by 2032, which implies a CAGR of around 6%. You also mentioned that Zoetis expect to grow faster than the market in this segment. So would you give us above half range of the market share of Zoetis parasiticide business in the next 3 to 5 years? How much our future growth in this segment will be supported by new product launch and how much will be supported by revenue growth of Trio and Revolution Plus? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let obviously Wetteny build there. We are the leader in parasiticides. We are really proud of that. We really see this as an important franchise. We have a broad set of products from Revolution to ProHeart to Simparica to Simparica Trio. We will be continuing to innovate in this important area. It is, by far, as you talked about, the largest therapeutic area in animal health. We really see a few things. Obviously, we are going to lead with innovation. We are going to lead with innovation in products that are easy to use, that really meet the customer demand as well as what our veterinarians are looking for. And we believe there's continued innovation in the space. We are looking at long actables, we are looking at injectables. We are looking at other combinations. Controlling parasites is critical to the overall health of the animal because if you don't, it creates lots of other issues. for animals. So we'll continue to grow in this important space. We think it will continue to be a major contributor to Zoetis' growth over the time period. So I don't know Wetteny, you want to add anything there?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. Look, what I would say is parasiticide is a -- the biggest sort of market segment within animal health. It's also a very competitive space. Now if you look at [indiscernible] combination, all medications, these are relatively new standard of care, and we are going to continue to see those expand the market with respect to the number of doses as well as from a price perspective. And this is the area that we play in the oral space largely. And so I would expect us to grow faster than the market. But again, it's a competitive space, and we'll continue to innovate as others do as well.\nKristin Peck: Yes. The only thing I'd also add there is one other growth that we haven't talked about much today is increase in compliance. I think if you look at retail and auto ship [ph] and injectables, I think right now, if you believe that the research will show you the average pet is really on a bet 6 to 7 months, when they should be on 12 months for many of these products. So I think if we can do a better job of driving compliance either through auto ship on e-commerce or home delivery through the vet or dual [ph] as injectables where you can guarantee compliance. So we think there's lots of potential growth drivers for Zoetis to continue to drive this market and take share.\nOperator: Thank you. We will take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Chris on for Steve. We had two questions. First, on the U.S. pet health market. You mentioned U.S. vet visits were flat in the quarter. Is this capacity driven? Or is it more related to demand and weakening new patient visits and oneness visits? And then second, do you expect any headwind from the restart of student [ph] loan repayments this fall? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks. As you look at the vet visits, they -- we really have seen them, on average, be flattish for the first half of the year. But to be clear, they're still ahead of where they were pre-pandemic, we do not see that as a demand issue. As we've talked about on previous calls, it's really more of a supply issue in the sense of the veterinary workforce challenges. We are working hard to partner with vets to help address this. Certainly, we are finding new efficiencies in their clinic helping to support as we can, adding more vet tech, et cetera, financial support, you name it, to support it. But we are not seeing any concerns around demand for veterinary health care. We are really focused on making sure that the supply is there. So no, we are not seeing , we don't look at the flat vet visits and have a cause for concern. Historically, just so you know, vet visits have been, give or take, flat to 1-ish historically. So this is not really concerning. And if you look at the first half of the year, we saw a 9% increase in both average revenue per visit and revenue overall in the clinic. So we are continuing to see really strong demand for veterinary care and for our product, and we don't really see that changing. And now on your second question on headwinds from student loan, we're not expecting that to be a significant driver for us in the back half of this year or in 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the floor over to Kristin Peck for any additional or closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Great. Thank you all for your questions today, and importantly, for your continued interest in Zoetis. Looking ahead, we really want to underscore that we remain confident in our full year guidance really because of sustainable underlying demand for animal health, as we just talked about, especially in uncertain times. We believe that the enduring strength of the human animal bond, their willingness to spend on pet health and the essential need for a safe and affordable food supply are all fundamental drivers of our growth. And I believe no one in the industry has a stronger set of capabilities and colleagues when it comes to meeting these customer needs, to advancing animal care and to creating shareholder value. So we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, and thank you for your time today. Have a great day.\nOperator: This does conclude the Zoetis second quarter 2023 financial results conference call and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call for 2023. I hope you were able to join us or listen to our Investor Day this past May. If you missed it, please checkout our replay on zoetis.com. I think you will find it worth the time in learning more about Zoetis and where we see future growth in animal health. We appreciated the opportunity to step beyond the cadence of our quarterly earnings call and speak to about the long range perspective on our business and on our industry during Investor Day. We also appreciated your questions and the ongoing dialogue about the issues most important to you. As you know, we shared more detail about our growth strategy, innovative pipelines, and the key franchises, capabilities and investments we are making to build on our competitive advantages as the world leader in animal health. The four tenets of our value proposition were affirmed and expanded on throughout the day, and you can expect us to revisit that framework and provide progress updates in future investor interactions. Our goal is always to ensure that you understand how we are positioned to deliver on our value proposition, the revenue growth, strategic investments, margin expansion and capital returns. With that covered, let's turn now to the second quarter financial results. Today, we reported strong second quarter results of 9% operational growth in revenue and 12% operational growth in adjusted net income based on our diverse portfolio across markets and species. As expected, we return to a more balanced segment growth this quarter with 11% operational growth internationally, and 7% growth in the U.S. Our companion animal portfolio grew 11% operationally, driven by our major franchises in dermatology, osteoarthritis pain and pet parasiticides. The second quarter results and drivers were more in line with our performance trends in recent years, with innovations and strength in our companion animal portfolio leading the way. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 4% operationally in the second quarter, driven by sales of poultry, cattle and fish products, and continue to demonstrate the benefits of our diversified portfolio across species and geographies with a strong first half. Overall, the first half of 2023 has played out much as we expected. We have grown revenue 6% operationally in the first half, driven by strong results from our international markets and livestock performance, which were partially offset by the distributor destocking we explained in the first quarter. As expected, the impact of distributor destocking in our U.S companion animal portfolio has stabilized and was not a significant factor in the second quarter. We continue to see strong customer demand for our companion animal portfolio. For the first half of 2023, companion animal grew 5% operationally. We believe companion animal should be a bigger driver of performance for the remainder of the year with a stronger second half driven by our key franchises. While we are monitoring how inflationary pressures may impact pet care spending in markets around the world, the underlying demand has remained steady and resilient to date, and this is what we have seen historically. In the U.S., veterinary clinic visits continue to stabilize staying relatively flat through the first half of the year, and clinic revenue and spend per visit were both up about 9% in the U.S in the first half. Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 8% operationally in the first half of 2023, reflecting strong growth internationally and continued supply recovery in our U.S cattle products. We expect live -- livestock growth for the full year to be in the low single digits operationally, reflecting tougher comparisons in the second half of the year for our U.S portfolio. With the first half of the year playing out largely as expected, we are maintaining our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue, and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income, at our companion animal portfolio we expect Librela and Solensia to continue to ramp up in various markets as we build our franchise for osteoarthritis pain. One way we are supporting growth for both products is increased use of direct-to-consumer campaigns in launch markets. These campaigns are building disease and product awareness, creating conversations among vets and pet owners and accelerating our efforts in markets where DTC is available. We're also pleased to have received U.S regulatory approvals in the second quarter for Librela and for Apoquel Chewable. Both have been performing well in markets outside the U.S to date. Librela is expected to launch in the U.S in November with an early experience trial beginning in September. As we look at the second half, we continue to expect strong growth, even as we factor in uncertainty around the macroeconomic conditions and drought that exists in certain countries around the globe, particularly Asia Pacific, and tougher comparisons for U.S livestock portfolio in the U.S. As we have seen historically in these types of environments, our global footprint and diverse portfolio provide more stability to our business during uncertain times. And we remain ready to pivot resources and investments to the greatest opportunity areas that it can ensure we continue to deliver on our commitments. For example, we continue to expand in large and growing product areas, such as parasiticide, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies for pain, vaccines and diagnostics, and invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, many of which we discussed at Investor Day. Before I wrap up, three quick points around our colleagues. First, I want to welcome Ester Banque to our Zoetis Executive Team as EVP and President of U.S Operations. Ester joined us in July coming most recently from Bristol Myers Squibb, and having spent a major part of her career at Novartis as well. She brings diverse global experience in health care, and an impressive track record of driving results to Zoetis. And I'm happy to say she is already off and running with the U.S business. I also wanted to call out the recent publication of our 2022 sustainability report. This year's report captures how sustainability is integrated across the business and shares the progress we are making toward are driven to care aspirations. This report honors our outstanding Zoetis colleagues who champion our purpose and work every day to make us the world's most trusted and valued animal health company. And finally, I wanted to mention a recent recognition from Fast Company, which names Zoetis as one of the Best Workplaces for Innovators. Shaping animal care through innovation is something we've always done across the company, and it's been a key element of our success. This is a well deserved honor for our culture, and our people who continuously strive to solve critical unmet medical needs in animal health from chronic illnesses, like osteoarthritis pain and allergic dermatitis for pets to emerging infectious diseases, threatening the food supply. I'm truly proud of our colleagues for receiving this recognition. In conclusion, with a solid first half behind us, I remain very positive about achieving our full year guidance, thanks to the purpose driven colleagues, innovation driven culture and diverse portfolio that continue to drive our success. Thank you. And now let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny? Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll start with the first question and let Wetteny follow-up on Librela. Yes, as we saw the -- this was the label for NexGard Plus was largely what we expected. I think Simparica Trio clearly has a superior label, and it was first to market. Right now Simparica Trio is #1 in companion animal [indiscernible] in the U.S. As you look at where we are, we've had 3 years of demonstrated efficacy and experience with this product. And we'll clearly leverage our retail auto ship to continue that. As you look at NexGard Plus, it obviously does not, as you saw, have heartworm from first dose -- it has 4 ticks versus 5. It doesn't yet have a label to prevent line. It has a lower minimum weight. So we really do think we have a strength in our Simparica Trio label will be aggressive, obviously, in competing against them. We are expecting a much stronger Q3 for the product based on comparable. So we expect a strong second half for us. We are expecting significant promos. We watch them do this before. This is something BI does often. So beyond the promos, we think we can be very competitive with our product based on the strength of our label, the strength of the experience with the product. Our relationships clearly with the corporates and really with a very pleased pet owner who's on this product. So obviously, we're ready for some significant competition, but we remain very confident overall and our strength in [indiscernible], and we see a stronger growth obviously in the next quarter and the second half for [indiscernible] overall. But Wetteny, do you want to take this question on Librela? Yes, I just want to reiterate, it is not -- I would not call Trio what is driving any change in the second half. I really want to emphasize what Wetteny said and what we said in our remarks. It really is, as we are looking at uncertainties with China, Southeast Asia, Australia with the drought. So I mean, as always, when you run a large global company, I think the advantage of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio and the durability. And that's by market, that's by species, and that's by therapeutic area. So we are obviously seeing strength in a lot of areas, but obviously, uncertainties remain in China, Southeast Asia and certainly in some other markets around the world, certain ones such as if you look at, say, at Spain, et cetera, which has got high inflation and weather issues as well. So I would say, I just want to be very clear. I don't think your characterization of Trio specifically repairs is the concern in the second half. It is much more around some of these macroeconomic and geopolitical and whether uncertainties that we're seeing in certain markets. Sure. I can start with your second. Yes, Librela U.S. is in, as we did note, obviously, in Wetteny's remarks. But to get to your question on derm and Wetteny can certainly follow-up with you once on the derm question -- on the Librela question. But we have led the way, as you know, in dermatology with both a small molecule and large molecule. We've been driving awareness through DTC. We still think there's significant market potential here in developed and emerging markets. There's still plenty of dogs that are untreated here. We are really focusing on investing in direct-to-consumer branded in the U.S. and in some markets and unbranded outside. With that, if you're seeing this year, we are looking at double-digit growth. In Q2, we had 14% growth with double-digit growth in both products in the quarter, so real strength. And we are continuing to innovate here. I think you saw also approval for Apoquel-2 in the U.S. We will look for long-acting Cytopoint, look at species, we are expecting obviously competition. We've been expecting it for a while. We'll say again, we're expecting it in 2024, and we'll see what happens. But we really are seeing more of a preference from both the vet and the pet owner moving more to Cytopoint for compliance reasons, obviously, for EE [ph]. So I think we'll continue to see that. So we are seeing very strong growth in dermatology. Again, we are expecting double digits for the year. In the quarter, we had great strength against both, but I would like to be clear that as we are seeing do we think will grow faster. We are seeing greater focus from the vet and the pet owner on Cytopoint being a greater driver of our overall dermatology franchise, but really expect to follow that up with strong innovation continuing in what we think is a really important space, Wetteny do you want to add anything on derma's question or Librela? Sure. Thanks, [indiscernible]. I'll take your questions and see what Wetteny wants to build on it. Life cycle innovation, obviously, is critical in dermatology. We're quite focused on it in a number of areas. I think you saw approval in May of -- or in the quarter of Apoquel Chewable which we had approved outside the U.S., but now got approved in the U.S. This is really important for a lot of pet owners who have trouble getting their dogs to take pills. So a chewable has real value there. We are also looking at monoclonal antibodies, looking at more long acting in that space. We are also looking at life cycle innovation around other species. Clearly, dermatology is a significant issue amongst many companion animals. So we'll continue to look for opportunities there. It is a big market. We will continue to lead in innovation and in life cycle innovation across a number of different areas. I said, from small molecules to monoclonal antibodies to additional species. So we are really focused there. As you look at Europe, I mean, I think for most companies that we say, the growth in Europe was ahead of what many of us expected for the year, mostly because I think we were expecting energy to be a much bigger issue certainly through the winter, et cetera. But we've seen a great strength, particularly in Northern Europe. But I would say that if you look at Southern Europe, I don't think it's performing as well as Northern Europe. They've got greater inflationary markets there as well as a number of weather issues with severe heat waves and drought across markets like Spain. But we really see the underlying demand in Europe and Northern Europe remaining strong, and we are seeing strong growth there. So I'm not sure, Wetteny, if you want to build on any of those comments. Sure. Thanks, Louise. We remain committed to the guidance we provided at Investor Day back in May. We really -- I would start with just the resiliency of the animal health industry. The industry itself, historically, as you know, grows at 4% to 6%. We see really strong tailwinds driving the industry over the next medium to long-term, increasing medicalization, especially in emerging markets, increases in population, really, the strength of the human animal bond. We are seeing increasing willingness to pay with 86% of pet owners say they'll pay whatever it takes to take care of their pet. But really where I think it differentiates Zoetis' innovation. Our innovation across chronic diseases. We look at -- what we can do as we talked about some of our new franchises that we think we will build over that time period as well. We look at an increasing global population, which is obviously driving the need for more sustainable ways of producing agriculture and meats and proteins, so we really think Zoetis will continue to outperform a market growing 4% to 6%. Historically, we've outperformed close to 3%. Zoetis is well diversified, and we are the innovation leader. We've got strong franchises today that are continuing to grow. Dermatology to be set, again this year are growing double-digit, parasiticides, OA pain, we've got strong diagnostics, emerging markets. So we really believe the industry is very attractive and very resilient. But most importantly, I think Zoetis as a leader in innovation will continue to drive this important space. Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll start and I'll let obviously Wetteny build there. We are the leader in parasiticides. We are really proud of that. We really see this as an important franchise. We have a broad set of products from Revolution to ProHeart to Simparica to Simparica Trio. We will be continuing to innovate in this important area. It is, by far, as you talked about, the largest therapeutic area in animal health. We really see a few things. Obviously, we are going to lead with innovation. We are going to lead with innovation in products that are easy to use, that really meet the customer demand as well as what our veterinarians are looking for. And we believe there's continued innovation in the space. We are looking at long actables, we are looking at injectables. We are looking at other combinations. Controlling parasites is critical to the overall health of the animal because if you don't, it creates lots of other issues. for animals. So we'll continue to grow in this important space. We think it will continue to be a major contributor to Zoetis' growth over the time period. So I don't know Wetteny, you want to add anything there? Yes. The only thing I'd also add there is one other growth that we haven't talked about much today is increase in compliance. I think if you look at retail and auto ship [ph] and injectables, I think right now, if you believe that the research will show you the average pet is really on a bet 6 to 7 months, when they should be on 12 months for many of these products. So I think if we can do a better job of driving compliance either through auto ship on e-commerce or home delivery through the vet or dual [ph] as injectables where you can guarantee compliance. So we think there's lots of potential growth drivers for Zoetis to continue to drive this market and take share. Sure. Thanks. As you look at the vet visits, they -- we really have seen them, on average, be flattish for the first half of the year. But to be clear, they're still ahead of where they were pre-pandemic, we do not see that as a demand issue. As we've talked about on previous calls, it's really more of a supply issue in the sense of the veterinary workforce challenges. We are working hard to partner with vets to help address this. Certainly, we are finding new efficiencies in their clinic helping to support as we can, adding more vet tech, et cetera, financial support, you name it, to support it. But we are not seeing any concerns around demand for veterinary health care. We are really focused on making sure that the supply is there. So no, we are not seeing , we don't look at the flat vet visits and have a cause for concern. Historically, just so you know, vet visits have been, give or take, flat to 1-ish historically. So this is not really concerning. And if you look at the first half of the year, we saw a 9% increase in both average revenue per visit and revenue overall in the clinic. So we are continuing to see really strong demand for veterinary care and for our product, and we don't really see that changing. And now on your second question on headwinds from student loan, we're not expecting that to be a significant driver for us in the back half of this year or in 2024. Great. Thank you all for your questions today, and importantly, for your continued interest in Zoetis. Looking ahead, we really want to underscore that we remain confident in our full year guidance really because of sustainable underlying demand for animal health, as we just talked about, especially in uncertain times. We believe that the enduring strength of the human animal bond, their willingness to spend on pet health and the essential need for a safe and affordable food supply are all fundamental drivers of our growth. And I believe no one in the industry has a stronger set of capabilities and colleagues when it comes to meeting these customer needs, to advancing animal care and to creating shareholder value. So we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress, and thank you for your time today. Have a great day."

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. As Kristin mentioned, we had a strong second quarter with balanced growth across both our companion animal and livestock portfolios, as well as our U.S and international segments. In the second quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 9% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $652 million were 15% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. Of the 9% operational revenue growth, 4% is from price and 5% is from volume. Volume growth consisted of 2% from other in-line products, 2% from new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and 1% from our key dermatology portfolio. Companion animal products are the primary driver of growth this quarter, growing 11% operationally with livestock growing 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. For companion animal, our key dermatology portfolio was the largest contributor to growth in the quarter, posting $355 million in revenue, our largest quarter ever and representing 14% growth on an operational basis. We saw double-digit operational growth in both international and the U.S. driven by strong growth in Cytopoint as well as growth driven by Apoquel and the conversion to Apoquel Chewable in certain international markets. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $69 million in revenue globally in the quarter with strong demand for both products as well as the impact of the launch of Librela in several new international markets. Our companion animal parasiticides also contributed to growth in the quarter, driven by our Revolution franchise, which had $103 million in revenue and grew 22% operationally. Simparica Trio also contributed to the parasiticide growth with $248 million of revenue and growth of 5% operationally. Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio recorded $92 million in revenue in Q2, growing 12% operationally. We saw double-digit growth in the U.S. driven by high instrument placements in the quarter and disruptions from the implementation of our new field force model that impacted the prior year. Sales of our livestock products grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw growth across both our U.S. and international segments driven by poultry, cattle and fish. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 7% with companion animal products growing 7% and livestock sales growing 5%. As Kristen mentioned, our companion animal performance in the quarter reflects the stabilization of the distributor inventory levels that were a headwind to our growth in Q1. U.S. vet visits were flat in the quarter. [Indiscernible] revenue growth and average revenue per visit were both up 8%. These trends are in line with expectations and continue to reflect the stabilization post-COVID. Turning to U.S. product performance. Our key dermatology product sales were $241 million for the quarter, growing 10% and benefited from higher periodic patient visits in the quarter. Cytopoint sales continue to drive growth with vets and pet owners showing a preference for injectables. Our U.S. small animal vaccines revenue grew 20% in the quarter, driven by higher sales of our canine influenza virus vaccine due in part to a competitor back order as well as higher sales into certain corporate and strategic accounts. Apoquel Chewable posted sales of $213 million in the quarter, growing 2%. Growth was driven by inpatient demand across all channels, partially offset by a difficult comparison period given the timing of distributor shipments from last year during our supply challenges as well as aggressive competitive promotion in the current quarter. Our growth cadence for Trio across the year will be impacted by the timing of supply recovery in 2022, and we expect growth rate improvement in the second half. As expected, we received FDA approval for Librela in the U.S. in May. We look forward to starting our early experience program in late Q3 with an expected November launch. Now turning to U.S. livestock. We saw 5% growth in our livestock portfolio in the quarter, primarily from our cattle business where we saw significant growth in Jackson, resulting from a favorable comparative quarter last year when an anticipated midyear price reduction limited sales in the quarter. Additional U.S. cattle growth came from Synovex, which benefited from our reimplementation label claim. Our U.S. poultry portfolio also contributed to growth of 11% based on our vaccine portfolio and an increased focus on egg layer market. We also benefited from favorable MFA rotations at certain large producers. Moving on to our International segment, where revenue was $1 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally in the quarter. International companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally in the quarter, while livestock revenue grew 4% operationally. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth of our small animal parasiticides, our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain and our key dermatology products. Our international parasiticide portfolio growth was primarily driven by a revolution franchise with $57 million in revenue, growing 52% operationally driven by the lack of supply last year, which particularly impacted China in the second quarter of 2022. Our Simparica franchise also contributed to growth with continued market share expansion, especially in Latin America, Europe and Asia. We continue to see strong adoption of Librela and Solensia. Librela generated $48 million in revenue with 89% operational growth in the quarter driven by strong growth in Europe, supported by our direct-to-consumer advertising efforts in major markets and recent launches in various international markets, including Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan. Solensia delivered $11 million of second quarter sales internationally, driven by higher demand and supported by direct-to-consumer marketing efforts. Our international key dermatology portfolio grew 22% operationally. We continue to see double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by growth from and conversion to Apoquel Chewable as well as from Cytopoint with higher compliance and new patients. Our growth also benefited from a weak comparative quarter in Japan, which was impacted by pre-priced buy ups in Q1 of last year. Moving on to our international livestock portfolio, which grew 4% on an operational basis in the quarter. Our poultry portfolio performed well with growth driven by key account penetration and MFA rotations in core poultry markets, including Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Our fish portfolio continues to perform well as a result of increased sales of vaccines across salmon markets in Norway and Chile. Lastly, our cattle portfolio saw gains in Turkey, Brazil and Argentina from strong price growth and the recovery of supply issues. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 72.4% improved 260 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from favorable foreign exchange, price increases and favorable product mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased 8% operationally with both SG&A and R&D growing 8% operationally driven primarily by headcount-related compensation costs due to the timing of new hires in 2022 and the impact of annual salary increases. The lower growth in R&D expenses this quarter is reflective of the timing of spend in project investments and not a reduction in our expected R&D spend for the full year. Year-to-date, adjusted R&D expenses has grown 13% operationally. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, an increase of 80 basis points, driven by higher net discrete tax expenses in the quarter, mainly related to changes to prior year's tax positions and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income grew 12% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% operationally in the quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $166 million and continue to be on track with our expectations for the year. In the quarter, we repurchased $324 million of Zoetis shares. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July, beginning with revenue for the full year due to unfavorable foreign exchange we are slightly lowering our revenue range while maintaining our guidance on operational revenue growth. We expect revenue between $8.50 billion and $8.65 billion, representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. With the approval of Librela in the U.S., we are now including our projected sales for November and December in our guidance, which are expected to be immaterial to our overall operational growth rate. Their impact on the full year revenue is largely offset by potential uncertainty in China as well as broader macroeconomic conditions in certain markets. Operationally, the first half has played out largely as we expected with 6% operational revenue growth. We expect stronger growth in the second half of the year overall, especially in our U.S. companion animal business. In livestock, which has grown 8% year-to-date on an operational basis. We anticipate unfavorable comparisons in the second half, driven by the timing of price decreases in Jackson in the U.S. last year, and the resumption of supply of several products after outages in the first half of 2022. We expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.50 billion to $2.55 billion, slightly above our previous guidance while maintaining our previous guidance of operational growth of 7% to 9%, driven by foreign exchange favorability in cost of sales and expenses, which were partially offset by unfavorability in revenue. Reported diluted EPS increases to a range of $5.15 to $5.27, which is impacted by foreign exchange and a one-time gain from a business development deal. And finally, due to the impact of foreign exchange, we are increasing adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.37 to $5.47. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we saw strong well based growth in the second quarter, growing in both companion animal and livestock as well as in the U.S. and internationally, with contributions from price and volume. We expect stronger growth as we move into the second half. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our operational full year guidance commitments. We continue to see improving fundamentals in the overall industry and remain committed to delivering on our value proposition to grow revenue faster than the market and to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Sure. Mike, thanks for the question. Look, we remain really on track with EU performance, and we are very pleased to see $48 million of Librela revenues in the quarter, up 89% versus the prior year. We also launched a product in a number of new markets in our International segment including Japan, Australia, Brazil and Canada. Those contributed about $10 million for the quarter. So we continue to see really strong demand for the product, and we are starting to initiate DTC campaigns, which will continue to drive awareness across both Librela and Solensia in our markets. It is already, as we said last year, the #1 osteoarthritis pain product in the EU. Look, we won't necessarily get into what the expectations are for next year. Obviously, we'll do that as we get into guidance for the year. We are expecting to continue to see strong growth for Librela on the balance of the year. I will note, last year, we did see a bit of an uptick in the third quarter. That was, as we released the allocations that we are on, and we saw clinics order a bit more, that was offset in Q4. So just a little bit of a dynamic in Q3 and Q4. But really with the new markets as well as continued growth in EU, we are expecting very strong growth in the third quarter as well. Yes, I'd be happy to take this and see what Kristin wants to add. With respect to companion animal, as we said, and I think you saw us really reiterate our guidance from an operational perspective 6% to 8%. Now while livestock has seen about 8% growth in the first half, we saw 4% growth in livestock in the second quarter operationally. We are expecting -- as we said in the prepared commentary, livestock to come in, in the low single-digit range. So I think you can clearly see that the growth in the back half of the year is going to be significantly driven by companion animal. And as we said also, given the timing of supply in 2022, we are facing -- relatively speaking, an easier comp in the U.S. companion animal business in the third quarter versus, say, the fourth quarter. So I think those will play out in terms of how you get -- how you map out to our guidance on an operational perspective, being largely driven by companion animal in the back half of the year. I think overall, not just from a companion animal perspective, overall, I would expect the third quarter to be another strong quarter for us. I would expect us to come in somewhere between the mid and high-end of our annual range. We said after last quarter, given the distributor destocking impact to a normalized growth for the rest of the year which would translate to somewhere -- if you just pick the midpoint of our guidance, that will be around 8%. We came in slightly above that, really in line with our expectations on the quarter. And so you can map out what that means for the rest of the year, but I would expect Q3 to be slightly above Q4 given what I just shared from a companion animal perspective versus less like that has a tougher comp in the third quarter, particularly in the U.S. Trio, like Kristin said, we are starting [ph] very strong quarter in third quarter despite the competitive launch, which we believe to be imminent here. Part of that is the cadence last year. I think the rhythm of supply last year clearly had an impact where we saw a bigger Q2 last year than in Q3. So I think you're going to see that play out with respect to the Trio growth. And given the first mover advantages that we have with Trio that's been in the market for over 3 years and our confidence in terms of our label, et cetera, we expect to see continued growth across Trio and a strong year for the year for Trio. Yes. Look, with respect to gross margin, you saw 72.4% gross margin on the quarter in Q2. That's up about 260 basis points versus last year. FX is about 200 basis points of that. And clearly, we've pegged our overall guidance on FX based on where rates were at the end of July. So I'm not going to venture to forecast what that might mean. But in terms of the other components that are driving our gross margin, price and mix, certainly were favorable for us. And as we've just discussed with respect to livestock having a tougher comp in the back half versus companion animal particularly into the third quarter, we expect price mix to continue to contribute favorably here. The other element, of course, is really manufacturing -- higher manufacturing costs. I think typically what you see is this first half is a little bit higher for us than the second half. Part of that is the mix with respect to cattle run in the fall that tends to have a little bit of a mix down on us overall. But I would say the overall mix for the company, given the back half strength in companion animal is going to be -- continue to be favorable. So we see that being something that will consistently sustain. And again, we won't get into next year's element until we get there. With respect to the second half, look, clearly, our expectations with Trio remain that we'll see strong growth contribution for Trio and we are going to see a very strong third quarter. I think some of the -- and by the way, the year has played out, as we said, we gave a range of 6% to 8% operationally, sitting here today after delivering a very strong second quarter, we remain in line with our expectations for the year at 6% to 8%. I think if you look at some of the areas that we're watching from a macro perspective, China is one of them. I think if you look at the data coming out of China, confidence levels for consumers are low, the savings rates are very high. And so we're watching that as well as the impact it has on the Southeast Asia region given the tourism impact that China has on that region. That's one of the areas. Certainly, we are watching here in terms of what goes into our thinking with respect to the balance of the year. Yes. Look, I think clearly, a really strong quarter for us in derm in the second quarter, and we are expecting another strong quarter and strong back half for derm across and clearly Cytopoint driving that as well. Just with respect to Librela, I just wanted to add a little bit of color in terms of our thinking there. Certainly, very pleased to have received approval in May. But really, consistent with our expectations, we've been sharing for the last, I think, 2 or 3 quarters, we've been expecting an approval to be -- to come in the first half of this year followed by an early experience program and then the launch late in the year is what we've been saying. We remain on track with that. We are planning to begin the early experience program next month with the launch to follow somewhere in the November time frame. Given the holidays and what's typically a little bit slower time frame with respect to clinics, et cetera, we're not expecting the contribution here to be significant to the growth for the year. And look, we continue to see great performance outside the U.S., and we are launching in other markets as well in line with our expectations as I shared a little bit earlier with an 89% growth rate on Librela on the quarter. And so we have factored that into the guidance here, but again, not a significant contribution. Yes, happy to answer. Look, as we said, we really reflected two things in our guidance today is, as we said, in fact, last quarter, FX was an area that we are watching, given the volatility that we are seeing across certain currencies that we operate in. And so we've updated guidance for FX both at the revenue line, which is negative. About -- it's about 75 basis points of growth essentially on a reported basis, that's impacting FX. So we reflected that here. But it's actually a positive contribution when you come down to EPS to the [indiscernible] $0.03. So what you're seeing there from an adjusted basis is really all FX. From a reported standpoint, we're also reflecting some gains that we saw from a couple of DB [ph] deals that are elevating the reported rate from an EPS perspective. The only other color I would ask -- add here with respect to the second half from the cadence is, again, we are expecting a very strong second half from a companion animal perspective versus livestock with the comps. I think if you look at the third quarter, we probably saw a bit lower OpEx in the prior year versus the fourth quarter. So I would expect OpEx will also be a little bit higher in Q3 versus Q4 as you look at the balance of the year. But other than that, I think price is something we typically do early in the year. There are certain markets where we may do a midyear price increase as well. But overall, price is something that happens fairly early in the year and pretty consistent with what you've seen in our numbers today. Yes. Look, I think just stepping back from a companion animal performance perspective, we've continued to see strength there across our international markets. Even in emerging markets, just in Poland recently you're seeing a real uptick in terms of companion animal continuing to take hold. I think some of the innovation that we have may take some time to take hold in other markets outside the U.S. and it takes longer to get to those peak sales. We are continuing to see really strong derm growth across our international markets and so on. So we believe that is sustainable. The first half, we've seen really strong growth there in terms of companion animal. Across international, we saw 17% operational growth in companion animal in the quarter following a 10% growth in Q1. I would continue to expect double-digit growth, maybe not at the level we saw in Q2 in the back half for international, we continue to see double-digit growth there. Yes. Look, what I would say is parasiticide is a -- the biggest sort of market segment within animal health. It's also a very competitive space. Now if you look at [indiscernible] combination, all medications, these are relatively new standard of care, and we are going to continue to see those expand the market with respect to the number of doses as well as from a price perspective. And this is the area that we play in the oral space largely. And so I would expect us to grow faster than the market. But again, it's a competitive space, and we'll continue to innovate as others do as well."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company\u2019s 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 4, 2023. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call for 2023. Today, we reported solid first quarter results of 4% operational growth in revenue as expected, based on our diverse portfolio and strength in international markets. As we indicated in February, we expected a softer first quarter and a stronger growth for the remainder of the year, and we are reiterating our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income, given the underlying strength of the petcare market. In the first quarter, our international segment led the way growing revenue 10% operationally and was partially offset by a 1% decline in the U.S. Our livestock portfolio drove the results with 12% operational growth in revenue, while companion animal product revenues were flat operationally. The performance in livestock was based on double-digit operational growth for cattle, poultry, sheep and fish. In the case of U.S. cattle, this performance was supported by an improvement in the supply of key products. Meanwhile, our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. declined due to distributors destocking and reducing their inventories in the first quarter. As well as higher purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022, which occurred in anticipation of price increases and based on promotional programs. We see strong end market demand in companion animal channels based on data from veterinary clinics, retailers and pet owners. And we view distributor inventories as a short-term impact on our companion animal sales. For example, while our sales into distributors declined in the quarter, as we expected, our product sales from distributors out to veterinary clinics were up approximately 8% and our product sales out of retail channels to pet owners were up about 35% up affirming a healthy petcare market in the U.S. Pet owner demand for product is expected to grow during the second quarter, pulling through more inventory and allowing purchase patterns by distributors to become more aligned with the underlying demand throughout the year. Other dynamics in the U.S. vet clinics also continue to show momentum and trending in a positive direction. Clinic visits increased 2% in the first quarter, showing an increase for the first time since 2021. Meanwhile, clinic revenue and average spend per visit continue to grow even in the face of inflationary pressures. Revenue and average dollars per visit increased 11% and 9% respectively in the quarter. The combination of evolving pet owner demographics, innovative medicines and an unbreakable human animal bond, all continue to support a positive and growing companion animal market where we lead. Despite the Q1 distributor issues in the U.S. our overall growth was driven by strength in international markets, which delivered 10% operational revenue growth in both livestock and companion animal portfolios. This quarter's results are a testament once again to how our diverse portfolio and geographic presence help deliver steady and predictable growth. Turning now to adjusted net income, we saw a decline of 3% operationally in the first quarter, which was in-line with our expectations. The first quarter reflected significant investments in our U.S. petcare field force and shifts in the go to market model for diagnostics, costs which were not incurred fully in the year ago quarter. We also saw increased investments in R&D, which we have discussed previously. The investments in diagnostics are maturing and gaining traction in the U.S., and we continue to grow and expand outside of the U.S. We expect a return to growth in U.S. diagnostics for the year as we build our Vetscan Imagyst AI platform, refine and grow our reference lab business and bring further innovative offerings to the space. Looking ahead, we see strong demand driving double digit operational growth for our innovative companion animal portfolio and relatively flat operational growth in our livestock portfolio this year. We will continue to invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, including large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics. For example, we continue to build out key product franchises through lifecycle innovations and claim extensions in products like Simparica Trio, Cytopoint and Draxxin. We are also expanding our global reach with approvals in additional markets for new livestock vaccines like Protivity, for beef and dairy calves, and Lawsotek for swine. And most recently, we purchased a manufacturing site outside Atlanta, Georgia, which will be used as a new monoclonal antibody, vaccine, and petcare product operation to add capacity for expected growth. As you know, our monoclonal antibody and vaccine platforms are rapidly growing and this new site would substantially expand manufacturing capacity for our biologics portfolio and ensure long-term supply across all global markets when it begins operations in 2026. While the overall economic uncertainty remains a headwind globally in 2020, 2023, we have proven to be up to any challenge. We have learned valuable lessons and built new muscles, especially over the last three years, developing more agility, flexibility and resilience in our business and our people. Despite the unusual mix of results in our first quarter, I continue to feel very positive about our full year guidance, and how our diverse portfolio and vision for the future of animal health can drive long-term sustainable growth, and create value for our customers and shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined yet adaptable in our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur throughout the year. We remain committed to delivering strong growth in 2023 based on our market leadership, innovative franchises and diverse portfolio, while continuing to invest for the future. Thank you. Now let me hand this off to Wetteny. Wetteny?\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, with growth driven by our livestock business and strong international market performance. Echoing Kristin\u2019s comment, our Q1 results are in-line with our expectations. As we indicated on our Q4 earnings call, we expected the first quarter to be below the low end of our forecasted annual operational growth rate of 6% for 2023. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion growing 1% on a reported basis and 4% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $607 million declined 3% on both a reported and an operational basis. Of the 4% operational revenue growth, 5%age from price with a 1% decline in volume. The volume decline is driven primarily by U.S. companion animal distributor destocking in the quarter. Our livestock portfolio led the way in terms of species growth growing 12% operationally with companion animal revenues flat on an operational basis in the quarter. Livestock growth was broad based with double-digit operational growth across cattle, poultry, sheep and fish. The growth in cattle was driven by additional supply of key products in the U.S. We saw growth in our poultry portfolio driven by higher sales of vaccines. Our sheep products benefited from favorable market conditions in Australia as well as our acquisition of Jurox in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, our fish portfolio continues to perform well with double-digit operational growth driven by strong vaccine performance in Norway. Sales of our companion animal products were flat operationally in the quarter, with growth in our monoclonal antibody products, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia, offsetting declines in Apoquel, parasiticides and anti-infectives. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $51 million in revenue globally in the quarter, with strong demand for both products. Additionally, Solensia benefited from our U.S. launch in the third quarter last year. As for Librela in the U.S. we still anticipate approval in the first half of this year with the launch later in the second half. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $151 million in the quarter, representing an operational decline of 7% versus the comparable 2022 period. This was primarily the result of U.S. distributor destocking during the quarter, as well as pre-price increased buy-in and promotional activity during the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by growth in our international markets from increased clinic penetration and launches in new markets. Our key dermatology portfolio declined 3% percent operation only with $290 million in global revenue. This decline is attributed to the impact of pre-price increased buy-ins in the U.S. in Q4, and in Japan in the comparable period in 2022. Cytopoint partially offset this decline with double-digit growth based on continued veterinary preference for injectables, which keep revenues in the clinic. Cytopoint better reflects underlying market demand due to our direct sales model on our dermatology portfolio and the lack of retail channel impacts. While we do believe conversion from Apoquel to Cytopoint may be accelerating, our overall outlook for our key dermatology portfolio remains unchanged. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 3% operationally, with declines in the U.S. partially offset by growth internationally. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1 billion in the quarter declining 1% with companion animal products declining 7% and livestock sales growing 15%. Companion animal performance in the quarter is reflective of the expectations we set in the prior quarter and is a result of distributor inventory and promotional impacts. As Kristin mentioned, demand for the veterinary market as demonstrated by distributor sales to clinics is healthy and growing. We continue to see robust sales outgrowth across our companion animal portfolio, including strong growth in parasiticides and our key dermatology products and our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. U.S. vet practice trends are improving, with clinic visits up 2% in the quarter and clinic revenue growth up 11%. Average revenue per visit is up 9%. These trends are slightly better than we expected and largely reflect the normalization of the COVID impact on vet clinic visits. Total visits in the quarter remain above pre-pandemic levels and clinic revenues have grown on average of 10% annually over that period. Spent per visit remains elevated as the standard-of-care continues to increase. Turning to product performance, the companion animal decline in the U.S. was driven largely by a decrease in sales of our parasiticides portfolio as well as key dermatology products. Simparica Trio posted sales of $127 million in the quarter, declining 13% driven by distributor destocking, partially offset by growth in patient share where we continue to outpace the overall flea, tick, and heartworm market. Our outlook for Trio remains unchanged as we continue to see strong customer demand and continued conversion from topicals and collars. Key dermatology products sales were $184 million for the quarter declining 5%. Apoquel sales were negatively impacted by high sales in Q4 ahead of our 2023 price increases and significant retail buy-in in Q1 2022. Cytopoint sales growth partially offset the Apoquel decline due largely to its injectable administration, which is preferred by clinics. The U.S. companion animal decline was partially offset by growth in sales of Solensia, which launched in the third quarter. We continue to see solid clinic penetration growth in Solensia and expect to drive awareness of feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns. U.S. livestock grew 15% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business where we have improved several supply outages, which impacted our revenues throughout 2022 and replenished our channel partner inventories. While we will continue to see benefit from improved supply, the replenishment impact is largely isolated to this quarter. We also saw growth in Synovex due to expanded label claims. Our poultry business also contributed to growth driven by expanded sales of vaccines. Moving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 10% operationally in the quarter with companion animal and livestock revenue both growing 10%. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, small animal parasiticides, as well as the impact of our Jurox acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of Librela and Solensia. Librela generated $34 million or 74% operational growth driven by strong underlying demand and the removal of supply allocations that were in-place for the first half of 2022. Solensia delivered $9 million in the first quarter sales internationally, driven by stronger demand. Simparica Trio was the top contributor to growth for our international small animal parasiticides with $24 million in revenue growing 47% operationally due to expanding market share in the flea, tick, and heartworm space. Our international key dermatology portfolio was flat operational in the quarter. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. However, this growth was offset by large pre-priced buy-ups of Apoquel in Japan in Q1 2022. Our international livestock segment also grew 10% operational in the quarter with growth in four of our five core species. Growth was driven by our cattle portfolio, which benefited from price increases in certain emerging markets. Our sheep business had an exceptional quarter with high demand in Australia due to favorable market conditions as well as the impact of our Jurox acquisition. Poultry also contributed to growth in the quarter with higher key account penetration in the Middle East and Eastern Europe as well as the benefit of price. And lastly, our fish portfolio continues to perform well, driven by growth in salmon vaccines in Norway. Swine was flat for the quarter with strong sales in China, partially offset by intermittent supply constraints in some markets. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.8% declined 80 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable product mix. This was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with SG&A growth of 11% operationally driven by headcount related compensation costs as a result of our U.S. small animal field force expansion, which largely began in Q2 of 2022, and higher T&E. R&D grew 19% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend for our pipeline candidates, advancing projects include disruptive, novel innovation and lifecycle management. R&D remains our first priority in capital allocation. Other income and deductions in the quarter are reflective of a favorable benefit associated with a settlement in the current period for prior period underpaid royalties related to sales of certain products. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% an increase of 160 basis points driven by lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income declined 3% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS declined 1% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $223 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year of 2023. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage. In the quarter, we repurchased $283 million of Zoetis shares and grew a dividend over 15% versus Q1 2022. Now, moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. As we have mentioned, the first quarter has gone largely as we expected. We are therefore reaffirming our 2023 guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. Foreign exchange rates have been volatile over the quarter. We will continue to monitor the impact of this volatility going forward. For the year, we continue to expect revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. We also continue to expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion representing operational growth of 7% to 9%. And finally, we expected this adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14, both consistent with our February guidance. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance commitments and expect more normalized growth in subsequent quarters. We continue to see positive trends and solid fundamentals in the underlying demand and are confident that our innovative portfolio will continue to allow us to go in-line with or faster than the market. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Jon Block from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Good morning. I'll ask both upfront I think importantly, is the channel now normalized in the U.S., Kristin? And then some rough crude math, but if you were down 7% U.S. companion animal and sales out were up 8% -- it's over like a 1500 basis point delta. And I sort of landed over $100 million in sales if you quantify that. So can you guys bridge how you get there? I guess there's $25 million to $30 million of parasiticides last quarter, or [does these] (ph) working down inventory by a week, whatever you can do to bridge that would be helpful. And then a quicker one, an easier one, Librela, I think you said approval still expected 1H. So launch 2H, is that the full launch call it before the end of the year. And then again, Kristin, how do you feel on your ability to serve demand we believe there's a lot of Solensia users that are chomping at the bid to get at it. So do you expect U.S. Librela supply to be an issue at all call it, 1H \u201824? Thanks guys.\nKristin Peck: Sure, Jon. I'll start with your second question. It's pretty straightforward. Yes, we continue to expect approval of Librela in the first half with the launch in the second half. The timing of exactly that a full launch, we would obviously, we've always said do early experience first and then go to full launch, the full launch could be very late in the year. But as we continue to -- and I'll reiterate again, the Librela is not in our numbers for the year. We do not include in our numbers for the year, a product that's expected to launch very late in the year for obvious reasons. So, we would do early experience. As we've always done with a full launch -- if we did a full launch, it will be very late in the year based on what we're saying. And no, we do not anticipate any supply challenges, on a full launch in 2024, whether it's late this year or early 2024, we don't see any challenges there. On your second question on distributor, I think we'll spend a bunch of time on that today. Obviously, there's a lot of complexity in that one. But again, it is in-line with what we expected and we really don't think the trend you see in the quarter is going to continue. Let me let what get into all the details because I know this is probably the biggest question we've been hearing early this morning. So, Wetteny, you want to go through some of the details?\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. Jon, the start of your question was, are we at normalized levels, I\u2019ll start there, first? And yes, we're at normalized levels here sitting here in the second quarter. And let me just step back and give you a little bit more details here. As Kristin said, we came into the year and as you may recall on the last call, we described how we saw increased buy-in in the fourth quarter. Driven by promotions that we ran on parasiticides, given we have recovery of supply late in the year, as we got through some of our supply constraints. And there was more pre-priced buy-in given the level of pricing pieces we're coming into 2023 with, in the fourth quarter above what I would call normal levels pre-price buy-in. So, we expected to see destocking in the quarter, which is why we said that the first quarter would be below the low end of the range of growth that we have for the year at 6% to 8%. So we've seen destocking in the first quarter down to I would say the lower end of our normal range that we've experienced historically. And as we step into -- and by the way, given rising interest rates, that is not unexpected. And then as we got into April, we saw slightly more destocking as we started the quarter, but those have normalized and have been reflected in the guidance that we just reiterated today. And so we're not anticipating a return back to normal levels in terms of inventories or assumption in our guidance is that they'll stay about where they are now. Now to be clear, if you look at the end market demand dynamics, they remain very strong. As we said in our earnings release, sales out of distributors into clinics were up 8% on a volume basis in the quarter. And if you look at retail, sales out pet owners were up 35% on the quarter. We've seen for the first time in about a year vet visit increased by 2%, and if you look at derm patients, for example, visit increased in the quarter versus a year ago. And so again, we've seen normalization since then, and by the way, international markets where we didn't see -- we haven't seen and don't expect to see the level of destocking that we've seen in the U.S. you saw 10% operational growth in our international markets across livestock and companion animal. And so again, without an extremely return to those levels and these are factored into our guidance, and we're contemplated when we gave the initial guidance back in February.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great. Thanks. Two questions, one on livestock, one on companion. So, on the livestock side, was there a stocking benefit across livestock in the segment in the quarter? Can you quantify that for us and how much of the strength in U.S. livestock should continue in the coming quarters, given that you expect flat for the year? And you touched on derm a little bit on the companion animal side, but you mentioned Apoquel declined with no competitors in that segment and your direct distribution strategy, what drove the decline, and does that volatility that you're seeing across that retail channel for this product change how you think about leveraging that alternative channel, and are you proactively shifting customers to side of going ahead of competition? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Erin. Again, livestock did grow 12% as you mentioned, which was in line with what we expected, but the growth really was driven by resupply or increased supply of a lot of key products As we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we continue to expect a flattish growth for livestock for the year. If you look at it we saw, if you look at the U.S. business, we think you'll see it's really more of a onetime sort of getting back into supply and some of this. Is it slightly up or slightly down? I think a lot of that is genuinely going to depend on China. If it's return to travel and dining out in China will drive growth in a number of our markets around the world in our export markets such as Brazil or Australia or even the U.S. So we continue to expect and built into our guidance for the year is to have a flattish livestock number, which obviously gets back to Wetteny\u2019s point, which is we're expecting very strong double digit growth in companion animal. As you look at derm for the quarter, it did decline, but this is largely due to the destocking of the pre-price buy-ins and promotions in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, the one-time issue in Japan back to Q1 of 2022, in fact, if you pull that out, international had double digit growth if you take out Japan. So again, this performance was in line with our expectations, but really importantly it is not indicative of our view of our expectations for the year. We continue to expect double-digit growth for the rest of the year and for the overall year for dermatology. Our sales out remain really strong. We're seeing a lot of uptick right now in Cytopoint, more and more on pet owners are really seeing the compliance benefits of it, the efficacy of it, invest, love it because it obviously stays in the clinic. As we continue to see the shift here it would compliance, I think again we'll underscore our growth there. And the other thing I'd mentioned that Wetteny mentioned is derm visits continue to grow in Q1. And we're not really seeing any pushback from customers on the price increases that we did do. So we continue to expect strong growth for derm for the year per our last guidance, double digit growth for derm.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, I would just add that first quarter is non-indicative of the year here, Aaron, similar to the overall results. And so to your point around retail channels, etcetera, we don't see us changing that. I think the fact that, Cytopoint we expect to continue to lead the growth for key derm franchise, we'll change the mix between those two. But not changing the overall picture and our expectations for derm remain the same for the rest of the year. And we're off to actually a strong start. In the second quarter for derm both in the U.S. and internationally.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. First, I want to ask about sort of the top line progression through the rest of the year. I think you'd point to some softness from what you previously and you talked about just now let me on when you saw distributors to start the second quarter. But any additional color you could give us as sort of we go through the rest of the year given that there is a relatively steep ramp implied in numbers right now just to hit your $8.65 billion and 68% operational growth. So just talk about the step up in 2Q, 1Q to 2Q versus 2Q to 3Q, 4Q. And then as a follow on to that, Kristin, you touched on Librela earlier, but I was wondering if you guys could comment on the other product launch expected this year, the competitor to Simparica Trio. We haven't seen that yet. Obviously can come any day, but just curious what you're hearing on that. And if your thoughts on what's going on parasiticides market have changed regarding that in terms of what some of your competitors are doing with stocking, what some of your competitors are doing with promotions of some of their products and sort of how that's impacting your view on tariff through the rest of the year. Thanks.\nWetteny Joseph: Hey, Mike. I'll start with progression for top line for the year and then I'll turn it over to Kristen. And she'll cover Librela launch in sure competition. So with respect to progression for the balance of the year, we expect normalized growth across the year starting with the second quarter, which obviously we're already about halfway into the second quarter. And as I mentioned just a little bit ago, we've got a strong start particularly in derm but across the board to what I'll call more normalized mix and normalized cadence for the balance of the year. One thing I would say is with respect to Q2, and that's normalized operational growth rate I'm referring to. If you take a look at FX, for example, that was about three points of headwind in the first quarter based on where rates are right now, I would expect about two points of headwind on the second quarter. So when you map out operational growth to reported growth, you should take that into consideration. That turns around in the second half again based on where rates are now and it ends up being slightly unfavorable on the year, year-on-year on FX on the top line and slightly favorable at the bottom line. So that's how I would sort of think through the progression. But again, starting with the second quarter, you should expect normalized growth to get to the guidance that we just reiterated at 6% to 8%.\nKristin Peck: Sure. And let me pick up your second question, which was the other product. We are continuing to expect competition in the second half of the year for Simparica Trio. But I want to underscore that as you look at the first quarter, we actually gained share. So as we said, there's very strong underlying demand for Simparica Trio in the U.S and even with competition coming, if you look at our performance, it was in line with our expectations. Again, we said it's not indicative of the year and we continue to expect strong growth for the remainder of the year. Even with competition in the second half. So we have been expecting this competition. The good news is it's later than we did expect. As we think about it, we've talked about this before, we're not expecting them to radically change any pricing if they would really I think given they are the leader right now with HEARTGARD NexGard, they would really cannibalize their own business. And I think it's important to keep in mind even if you look at the quarter. They ran very strong promotions ahead of their launch. And even with those promotions, we gained share in that quarter. So we remain very confident in the strength of Simparica Trio. In the strength of our relationships with that in the pet owner satisfaction of it, we do expect competition. We think they'll bring a product as I said in the second half of the year, but we remain confident of the strong growth for Simparica Trio as we said before for the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thanks for the questions. Sorry to keep honing in on the destocking dynamics, but could you maybe just talk about how the first quarter U.S. companion animal sales kind of played out month by month? It seems like January and February price saw the bulk of the impact from the pre buy-in and pull forward into the fourth quarter. It sounded like the destocking might have occurred a little bit later in the quarter. I think this is people are looking to get better visibility on the improvement in the second quarter. Could you maybe just comment on how March or April played out just as we think about kind of where the business is heading into the second quarter?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So look, I'll be happy to answer the question as to destocking. We saw destocking from the start of the quarter just as we anticipated and as we discussed in some of prior call given the dynamics coming out of Q4. As we mentioned too in the last call, the timing of our supply recovery in terms of last year would have had an impact on the cadence on the year, which is playing out exactly as we thought. I'll give you a little bit more color perhaps that might be helpful if you think about what the end market demand looks like. When we look at our sales out of distribution to clinics, we said its 8% volume growth on the quarter. If you look at how those played out for March, the end of the quarter, they're actually above that number. So, we haven't seen anything in terms of what the end markets are that would indicate a slowdown. And as I said, we've had a strong start to the second quarter and we're sitting here in the middle of the second quarter, and I'm saying that we would see normalized growth starting in this current quarter for the balance of the year.\nKristin Peck: Yeah. And I think I want to also reiterate what Wetteny said earlier, which is they are at very low levels, the lower end of their ranges, but our guidance expects that they do not go back up. We believe that given the current interest rate environment, our expectation is that they will stay at this level. So again, our confidence in the guidance we're providing is assuming that they're not going back up, they will stay at the levels that they're at now.\nOperator: And we will go next to Louise Chen with Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So wanted to ask you, on your upcoming investor event, what will you discuss here? What are some of the key things that you're going to be going over. It's been a while since you've had investor event. And will you be disclosing more additional pipeline products, longer term guidance, anything from that front? And then I also wanted to ask you in your diagnostics business, what's the outlook for the remainder of the year on that business? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. We are excited for our Investor Day. We spent a time talking to a lot of our investors over the last six months as to what they're looking about. Our focus there will be really on building confidence in our medium to long term growth expectations. We've gotten a lot of questions obviously on our pipeline and R&D. So, you'll see us as we mentioned in our press release, Rob Polzer, our Head of R&D will be coming to give more detail on our R&D portfolio. And we also look forward to introducing you to other members of our leadership team. So you get to meet them as well. We're excited to share what we view as the short medium and long term growth aspirations and give you some confidence in more detail around all of those. So Wetteny, do you want to take her second question on diagnostics?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, happy to, Kristen. So look on diagnostics, we have seen increased productivity from our diagnostics team, particularly if you look at the U.S. where we made the change about a year ago into the second quarter. In this first quarter, we actually saw very strong placements across our instruments, including images as well. Those will help drive growth from a consumables perspective if you look at the rest of the year consistent with our guidance, we said we would expect to see improvements in terms of that to the productivity given the new field force and the change out that we did last year. And we would expect to see return to growth in the U.S. in the back half of this year. And again, we're lapping those changes that we made, which we believe -- firmly believe are going to drive long term growth for the business in addition to innovation that we continue to work on in terms of diagnostics.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So just to get on the Simparica Trio franchise and so in the distributor dynamics here, I usually think about the parasiticide portfolio is being heavy in March to August season. As we take a step back or take a zoom outlook, do you think any of the dynamics that have happened with some of the distributor destocking is going to be a net negative for the annual sales of the product? Put it another way, do you think maybe at this impact the timing of missing the flea and tick season in any of this kind of dynamic? And then just to reiterate on the inventory question on the livestock portfolio, it doesn't have the same dynamics, right? So I mean like the price increases in livestock were not the same as the price increases in companion. Therefore, you wouldn't see some of that same distributor dynamic. And then if I could squeeze just one more, just I want to -- I didn't see the inventory or the balance sheet yet, so just wanted to see if inventory levels trended up or down. Thank you. Sorry. That was one.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Let me start with Trio and then I'll let Wetteny take the other two. I want to underscore what we said earlier. We have very strong demand in sales out. And so what you saw in Trio in the first quarter was a stocking issue. But as we look at the demand for the product and where it's going, it has no effect on the flea and tick season as needed. We have full supply in. I think what makes it a little complicated and as unusual was the supply issues we had in Q3, Q2 and Q3 of 2022 put us putting a lot more inventory into the channel at the end of Q4. Trying to restock shelves against what we thought as you remember was going to be a launch in Q1 of a competitor. So I think there's obviously some quarter-to-quarter stocking dynamics, but I want to underscore demand for this product remains strong. We gained share in the quarter. We are now at normal inventory levels, so no, we do not see anything if you look at the Q2 to Q3 of the product and which we would agree that is normally Q2 to Q3 is the strongest sales normally in parasiticides. So, we continue to see very strong demand for the product. Obviously, there is some quarter-to-quarter stocking stuff that is relatively unique as you look at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. But we don't think that actually signals through anything and the demand for the product or importantly the strong growth we see for the product for the year. Even as we said assuming competition in the second half.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, look, I think there were couple other parts to your question, I'll touch on in terms of livestock. We're not seeing the same dynamics in livestock. Look, I mean if you look at where we ended last year, maybe we're in the middle of the range towards the bottom of the range, might have been slightly increase in the quarter given the recovery of some supply for certain products as we mentioned in our prepared commentary, but overall, not any meaningful movement there to speak of. And then with respect to our balance sheet on inventory, as you know, we are ramping up certain products, anticipating launch and approval of certain other products that will continue to drive inventories. First, if you look at operating cash flows on the quarter, they're actually favourable to last year because as inventories continue to increase, we saw really strong performance on receivables and other NAP. So overall, operating cash flows look favorable versus a year ago.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. Couple from me. Firstly, could you give an update on the supply chain issues which impacted growth in 2022, be it in the vaccine side Trio or [indiscernible] and would you foresee or anticipate any supply chain issue impacting any of your key products this year? Secondly, I wasn't sure I got the derm decline fully. This is not a distributed independent segment. Can you provide some numbers around the derm segment and help us understand what led to the decline? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with your first question on supply chain and maybe Wetteny can build on my derm answer from before. With regards to the supply chain, as we expected, we have completely normalized the supply chain. We always have some small level of challenges as we mentioned before in the biologics. But the challenges we saw in 2022 have been resolved as we indicated they would be. We're back into normal supply on these products as you look at whether that's parasiticides or importantly our monoclonal antibodies. As expected, those are at normalized levels. We'll have some small number in bios as we always have that all of our competitors generally have. But supply chain has been normalized and we don't foresee any specific supply chain challenges in 2023 going forward. But maybe Wetteny you can build up my previous comments on derm segment if you can clarify some of these questions?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, I'd be happy to. So look, the derm story is similar in terms of destocking from pre-price buy-ins that we saw in the U.S. into retail in Q4. As well as a year ago, if you look at Japan and if you look at our reporting last year in Q1, you would have seen a significant growth rate for Japan in the first quarter, driven by those pre-price buy ups in Apoquel. And then you saw that go the other way in the second quarter. So if you were to I would say pro form the results for the first quarter taking into account what I just said, you will see double digit growth for the derm franchise in both the U.S. and international.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Katarina] (ph) on for Chris. Thank you so much for taking our questions. So, first on price increases, any feedback from the price increases in the beginning of the year, are you seeing any pushback from veterinarians or pet owners and any initial thoughts of how you'll be approaching price increases in 2024. And then the second question is on diagnostics, any thoughts on the proposed Mars Heska acquisition and the impact that will have on the diagnostics market? Does it change Zoetis\u2019 plans and diagnostics or the investments you're making in that market? Thank you so much.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, [Katarina] (ph). I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take your first question on the pricing. I really think the margin acquisition of Heska confirms that the veterinary diagnostics market continues to be incredibly attractive investment area. Most importantly it reinforces our strategy, we think the sound around committees executed around in the U.S. specifically building our reference lab network and continuing to invest in innovation importantly in our point of care. We've had a robust start to 2023 as we look at our images, our virtual lab, our reference lab offering, we really believe it's resonating with customers. And really our focus is on leading with cutting edge medicine, really rolling out our virtual lab, which we really think is a differentiator. And we think that's what differentiates what it's overall is innovation in the space, innovation around point of care, innovation in customer experience and innovation in the reference side. So no, we really see that acquisition as reconfirming our strategy. And really we're going to accelerate our growth focus on innovative diagnostics. So, Wetteny, do you want to take our second group of questions around pricing?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, we have not seen any pressure in terms of end market demand given our price increases. We took 5% price on the quarter that's up versus 3% last year. If you look at the end market dynamics that we described earlier, you're seeing significant growth out from distributors to clinics, but also importantly, you're seeing significant growth from retail into pet owners. And we continue to see increased patient visits, for example, in derm, etcetera. So we have not seen any resistance there in terms of price increase. And by the way, if you look at international, we grew 10% in companion animal in the quarter given price increases as well and despite some pre-price buy in, which is normal in the fourth quarter. So we haven't seen any signs of that. If you look at livestock, that actually offsets some of the -- marginally offset some of the price increases we would have seen in companion animal. We can just see some impact on Draxxin, but not meaningful not at the level that we've seen previously as we previously said and actually we saw some volume offset to that positively offsetting some of the price on the Draxxin side. So all told in good shape in terms of what we're seeing in terms of market reaction to our prices. And in terms of what it means for 2024, too early to tell. We won't go into that yet.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on guidance. You started off the year pretty strong despite kind of inventory levels creating a little bit of noise here. But if you kind of read through that, you're looking at, I don't know, like high single digits, maybe even double digits operational growth to start the year reiterated guide for 6% to 8% operational growth. So the question being basically what would get you to that low end of that operational growth range given the strength you're already seeing in the year if you kind of read through the noise?\nWetteny Joseph: So look, if you look at the end market dynamics that we see, we see strength there, so I think that supports certainly the mid to high end of our guidance I would say. If you look at what it means for the rest of the year and I'll reiterate this point, which is we're already halfway through the second quarter. And again, we're seeing strong start to the quarter and we'll see that normalized growth rate including mix by the way for the balance of the year. And keep in mind, right, our guidance didn't change including what we expect from livestock for the balance of the year. Right? We went from saying livestock could be minus one to plus one. We're saying it's flattish, basically the same thing. So how Q1 has played out exactly as we thought essentially and therefore the rest of the year is the same. And so no point in our guidance range is any, I would say, more probable than the other, we feel great about where we are on the year. And how it's starting out for us in the second quarter, particularly, despite what you described as the noise in terms of the inventory levels.\nOperator: And we'll go next to [Steve Scholar with PD Cohen] (ph). Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. A couple of questions. First, the new manufacturing facility in Georgia, is the investment based predominantly on increased forecasts for current products or positive late stage R&D progress for which we at least on the outside currently don't have visibility or is this some combination? And in the prepared remarks, you referred to disruptive novel innovation in the pipeline. Should we expect to get a window on that during the May meeting? And can you tell us if this is likely mainly directed at currently untreated diseases, more species, wider claims within existing species, improve dosing or something else? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. The new manufacturing facility in right outside of Atlanta, Georgia will be both to support current products and the growth in our current products as well as we'll target launching some of our new monoclonal antibodies out of that facility as well. It's a very large facility. It gives us tons of flexibility, which is what we found really exciting about the opportunity to be able to use it for lots of different things and really build a strong centre in the South with a great labor market, really good access to workforce that we think makes a lot of sense. So we actually -- we see it\u2019s the facility's ability to do both and that is currently the intention. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect it to be fully operational by 2026 and doing both at that point. With regards to Investor Day, we will be looking at the whole portfolio. We'll give you more details which we've been asked for around the pain opportunity and what we're expecting there. We'll also talk about some of the new disease areas we've mentioned before. It will give you a sense of what we think those markets could look like. A lot of those markets are new markets, so we'll help you size that market. We'll talk a lot about what our pipeline looks like. And what we're doing now. So we'll give you information both on a species basis importantly on sort of key technologies as we talked about in monoclonal areas -- monoclonal antibodies. And then also lastly, talk about some of these emerging big new markets that we think we can attack with some of our new novel technologies.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the program back to Kristin Peck for closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Thank you. So look, just to summarize, we really see a very positive and sustainable demand for our product based on what we've talked about for long time which is the fundamental drivers of animal health. We are confident that Zoetis has the industry's most diverse and durable global portfolio. And this is really founded on innovative science as we talk about and supported by a high quality supply chain. We'll remain focused this year and going forward on our five key growth catalyst; dermatology, pet parasiticides, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. And we're going to continue to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the capabilities that support this future growth while ensuring that we can adapt to the dynamic environment that we all operate in. And we really look forward to sharing more about this with you. Our vision, our pipeline, our strategies for growth at our Investor Day on May 25th. And there you'll hear more from me, Wetteny, our Head of R&D, Rob Polzer, about the confidence we have in the animal health industry. And importantly, our ability to go faster than that market and the investments that we're making to create that value for our shareholders. So, we announced the event this week and I hope you can all join us virtually or at the New York Stock Exchange. As always, you can find more details about our Investor Relations information on our website. So thanks so much for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to our first quarter earnings call for 2023. Today, we reported solid first quarter results of 4% operational growth in revenue as expected, based on our diverse portfolio and strength in international markets. As we indicated in February, we expected a softer first quarter and a stronger growth for the remainder of the year, and we are reiterating our full year guidance for operational growth of 6% to 8% in revenue and 7% to 9% in adjusted net income, given the underlying strength of the petcare market. In the first quarter, our international segment led the way growing revenue 10% operationally and was partially offset by a 1% decline in the U.S. Our livestock portfolio drove the results with 12% operational growth in revenue, while companion animal product revenues were flat operationally. The performance in livestock was based on double-digit operational growth for cattle, poultry, sheep and fish. In the case of U.S. cattle, this performance was supported by an improvement in the supply of key products. Meanwhile, our companion animal portfolio in the U.S. declined due to distributors destocking and reducing their inventories in the first quarter. As well as higher purchases in the fourth quarter of 2022, which occurred in anticipation of price increases and based on promotional programs. We see strong end market demand in companion animal channels based on data from veterinary clinics, retailers and pet owners. And we view distributor inventories as a short-term impact on our companion animal sales. For example, while our sales into distributors declined in the quarter, as we expected, our product sales from distributors out to veterinary clinics were up approximately 8% and our product sales out of retail channels to pet owners were up about 35% up affirming a healthy petcare market in the U.S. Pet owner demand for product is expected to grow during the second quarter, pulling through more inventory and allowing purchase patterns by distributors to become more aligned with the underlying demand throughout the year. Other dynamics in the U.S. vet clinics also continue to show momentum and trending in a positive direction. Clinic visits increased 2% in the first quarter, showing an increase for the first time since 2021. Meanwhile, clinic revenue and average spend per visit continue to grow even in the face of inflationary pressures. Revenue and average dollars per visit increased 11% and 9% respectively in the quarter. The combination of evolving pet owner demographics, innovative medicines and an unbreakable human animal bond, all continue to support a positive and growing companion animal market where we lead. Despite the Q1 distributor issues in the U.S. our overall growth was driven by strength in international markets, which delivered 10% operational revenue growth in both livestock and companion animal portfolios. This quarter's results are a testament once again to how our diverse portfolio and geographic presence help deliver steady and predictable growth. Turning now to adjusted net income, we saw a decline of 3% operationally in the first quarter, which was in-line with our expectations. The first quarter reflected significant investments in our U.S. petcare field force and shifts in the go to market model for diagnostics, costs which were not incurred fully in the year ago quarter. We also saw increased investments in R&D, which we have discussed previously. The investments in diagnostics are maturing and gaining traction in the U.S., and we continue to grow and expand outside of the U.S. We expect a return to growth in U.S. diagnostics for the year as we build our Vetscan Imagyst AI platform, refine and grow our reference lab business and bring further innovative offerings to the space. Looking ahead, we see strong demand driving double digit operational growth for our innovative companion animal portfolio and relatively flat operational growth in our livestock portfolio this year. We will continue to invest in the franchises and capabilities that support our future growth, including large and growing product areas like parasiticides, dermatology, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines and diagnostics. For example, we continue to build out key product franchises through lifecycle innovations and claim extensions in products like Simparica Trio, Cytopoint and Draxxin. We are also expanding our global reach with approvals in additional markets for new livestock vaccines like Protivity, for beef and dairy calves, and Lawsotek for swine. And most recently, we purchased a manufacturing site outside Atlanta, Georgia, which will be used as a new monoclonal antibody, vaccine, and petcare product operation to add capacity for expected growth. As you know, our monoclonal antibody and vaccine platforms are rapidly growing and this new site would substantially expand manufacturing capacity for our biologics portfolio and ensure long-term supply across all global markets when it begins operations in 2026. While the overall economic uncertainty remains a headwind globally in 2020, 2023, we have proven to be up to any challenge. We have learned valuable lessons and built new muscles, especially over the last three years, developing more agility, flexibility and resilience in our business and our people. Despite the unusual mix of results in our first quarter, I continue to feel very positive about our full year guidance, and how our diverse portfolio and vision for the future of animal health can drive long-term sustainable growth, and create value for our customers and shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined yet adaptable in our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that could occur throughout the year. We remain committed to delivering strong growth in 2023 based on our market leadership, innovative franchises and diverse portfolio, while continuing to invest for the future. Thank you. Now let me hand this off to Wetteny. Wetteny? Sure, Jon. I'll start with your second question. It's pretty straightforward. Yes, we continue to expect approval of Librela in the first half with the launch in the second half. The timing of exactly that a full launch, we would obviously, we've always said do early experience first and then go to full launch, the full launch could be very late in the year. But as we continue to -- and I'll reiterate again, the Librela is not in our numbers for the year. We do not include in our numbers for the year, a product that's expected to launch very late in the year for obvious reasons. So, we would do early experience. As we've always done with a full launch -- if we did a full launch, it will be very late in the year based on what we're saying. And no, we do not anticipate any supply challenges, on a full launch in 2024, whether it's late this year or early 2024, we don't see any challenges there. On your second question on distributor, I think we'll spend a bunch of time on that today. Obviously, there's a lot of complexity in that one. But again, it is in-line with what we expected and we really don't think the trend you see in the quarter is going to continue. Let me let what get into all the details because I know this is probably the biggest question we've been hearing early this morning. So, Wetteny, you want to go through some of the details? Sure. Thanks, Erin. Again, livestock did grow 12% as you mentioned, which was in line with what we expected, but the growth really was driven by resupply or increased supply of a lot of key products As we reiterated in our prepared remarks, we continue to expect a flattish growth for livestock for the year. If you look at it we saw, if you look at the U.S. business, we think you'll see it's really more of a onetime sort of getting back into supply and some of this. Is it slightly up or slightly down? I think a lot of that is genuinely going to depend on China. If it's return to travel and dining out in China will drive growth in a number of our markets around the world in our export markets such as Brazil or Australia or even the U.S. So we continue to expect and built into our guidance for the year is to have a flattish livestock number, which obviously gets back to Wetteny's point, which is we're expecting very strong double digit growth in companion animal. As you look at derm for the quarter, it did decline, but this is largely due to the destocking of the pre-price buy-ins and promotions in the U.S. And as Wetteny mentioned in his remarks, the one-time issue in Japan back to Q1 of 2022, in fact, if you pull that out, international had double digit growth if you take out Japan. So again, this performance was in line with our expectations, but really importantly it is not indicative of our view of our expectations for the year. We continue to expect double-digit growth for the rest of the year and for the overall year for dermatology. Our sales out remain really strong. We're seeing a lot of uptick right now in Cytopoint, more and more on pet owners are really seeing the compliance benefits of it, the efficacy of it, invest, love it because it obviously stays in the clinic. As we continue to see the shift here it would compliance, I think again we'll underscore our growth there. And the other thing I'd mentioned that Wetteny mentioned is derm visits continue to grow in Q1. And we're not really seeing any pushback from customers on the price increases that we did do. So we continue to expect strong growth for derm for the year per our last guidance, double digit growth for derm. Sure. And let me pick up your second question, which was the other product. We are continuing to expect competition in the second half of the year for Simparica Trio. But I want to underscore that as you look at the first quarter, we actually gained share. So as we said, there's very strong underlying demand for Simparica Trio in the U.S and even with competition coming, if you look at our performance, it was in line with our expectations. Again, we said it's not indicative of the year and we continue to expect strong growth for the remainder of the year. Even with competition in the second half. So we have been expecting this competition. The good news is it's later than we did expect. As we think about it, we've talked about this before, we're not expecting them to radically change any pricing if they would really I think given they are the leader right now with HEARTGARD NexGard, they would really cannibalize their own business. And I think it's important to keep in mind even if you look at the quarter. They ran very strong promotions ahead of their launch. And even with those promotions, we gained share in that quarter. So we remain very confident in the strength of Simparica Trio. In the strength of our relationships with that in the pet owner satisfaction of it, we do expect competition. We think they'll bring a product as I said in the second half of the year, but we remain confident of the strong growth for Simparica Trio as we said before for the year. Yeah. And I think I want to also reiterate what Wetteny said earlier, which is they are at very low levels, the lower end of their ranges, but our guidance expects that they do not go back up. We believe that given the current interest rate environment, our expectation is that they will stay at this level. So again, our confidence in the guidance we're providing is assuming that they're not going back up, they will stay at the levels that they're at now. Sure. We are excited for our Investor Day. We spent a time talking to a lot of our investors over the last six months as to what they're looking about. Our focus there will be really on building confidence in our medium to long term growth expectations. We've gotten a lot of questions obviously on our pipeline and R&D. So, you'll see us as we mentioned in our press release, Rob Polzer, our Head of R&D will be coming to give more detail on our R&D portfolio. And we also look forward to introducing you to other members of our leadership team. So you get to meet them as well. We're excited to share what we view as the short medium and long term growth aspirations and give you some confidence in more detail around all of those. So Wetteny, do you want to take her second question on diagnostics? Sure. Let me start with Trio and then I'll let Wetteny take the other two. I want to underscore what we said earlier. We have very strong demand in sales out. And so what you saw in Trio in the first quarter was a stocking issue. But as we look at the demand for the product and where it's going, it has no effect on the flea and tick season as needed. We have full supply in. I think what makes it a little complicated and as unusual was the supply issues we had in Q3, Q2 and Q3 of 2022 put us putting a lot more inventory into the channel at the end of Q4. Trying to restock shelves against what we thought as you remember was going to be a launch in Q1 of a competitor. So I think there's obviously some quarter-to-quarter stocking dynamics, but I want to underscore demand for this product remains strong. We gained share in the quarter. We are now at normal inventory levels, so no, we do not see anything if you look at the Q2 to Q3 of the product and which we would agree that is normally Q2 to Q3 is the strongest sales normally in parasiticides. So, we continue to see very strong demand for the product. Obviously, there is some quarter-to-quarter stocking stuff that is relatively unique as you look at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023. But we don't think that actually signals through anything and the demand for the product or importantly the strong growth we see for the product for the year. Even as we said assuming competition in the second half. Sure. I'll start with your first question on supply chain and maybe Wetteny can build on my derm answer from before. With regards to the supply chain, as we expected, we have completely normalized the supply chain. We always have some small level of challenges as we mentioned before in the biologics. But the challenges we saw in 2022 have been resolved as we indicated they would be. We're back into normal supply on these products as you look at whether that's parasiticides or importantly our monoclonal antibodies. As expected, those are at normalized levels. We'll have some small number in bios as we always have that all of our competitors generally have. But supply chain has been normalized and we don't foresee any specific supply chain challenges in 2023 going forward. But maybe Wetteny you can build up my previous comments on derm segment if you can clarify some of these questions? Sure. Thanks, [Katarina] (ph). I'll take your second question first and then let Wetteny take your first question on the pricing. I really think the margin acquisition of Heska confirms that the veterinary diagnostics market continues to be incredibly attractive investment area. Most importantly it reinforces our strategy, we think the sound around committees executed around in the U.S. specifically building our reference lab network and continuing to invest in innovation importantly in our point of care. We've had a robust start to 2023 as we look at our images, our virtual lab, our reference lab offering, we really believe it's resonating with customers. And really our focus is on leading with cutting edge medicine, really rolling out our virtual lab, which we really think is a differentiator. And we think that's what differentiates what it's overall is innovation in the space, innovation around point of care, innovation in customer experience and innovation in the reference side. So no, we really see that acquisition as reconfirming our strategy. And really we're going to accelerate our growth focus on innovative diagnostics. So, Wetteny, do you want to take our second group of questions around pricing? Sure. The new manufacturing facility in right outside of Atlanta, Georgia will be both to support current products and the growth in our current products as well as we'll target launching some of our new monoclonal antibodies out of that facility as well. It's a very large facility. It gives us tons of flexibility, which is what we found really exciting about the opportunity to be able to use it for lots of different things and really build a strong centre in the South with a great labor market, really good access to workforce that we think makes a lot of sense. So we actually -- we see it's the facility's ability to do both and that is currently the intention. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect it to be fully operational by 2026 and doing both at that point. With regards to Investor Day, we will be looking at the whole portfolio. We'll give you more details which we've been asked for around the pain opportunity and what we're expecting there. We'll also talk about some of the new disease areas we've mentioned before. It will give you a sense of what we think those markets could look like. A lot of those markets are new markets, so we'll help you size that market. We'll talk a lot about what our pipeline looks like. And what we're doing now. So we'll give you information both on a species basis importantly on sort of key technologies as we talked about in monoclonal areas -- monoclonal antibodies. And then also lastly, talk about some of these emerging big new markets that we think we can attack with some of our new novel technologies. Thank you. So look, just to summarize, we really see a very positive and sustainable demand for our product based on what we've talked about for long time which is the fundamental drivers of animal health. We are confident that Zoetis has the industry's most diverse and durable global portfolio. And this is really founded on innovative science as we talk about and supported by a high quality supply chain. We'll remain focused this year and going forward on our five key growth catalyst; dermatology, pet parasiticides, pain, diagnostics and emerging markets. And we're going to continue to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the capabilities that support this future growth while ensuring that we can adapt to the dynamic environment that we all operate in. And we really look forward to sharing more about this with you. Our vision, our pipeline, our strategies for growth at our Investor Day on May 25th. And there you'll hear more from me, Wetteny, our Head of R&D, Rob Polzer, about the confidence we have in the animal health industry. And importantly, our ability to go faster than that market and the investments that we're making to create that value for our shareholders. So, we announced the event this week and I hope you can all join us virtually or at the New York Stock Exchange. As always, you can find more details about our Investor Relations information on our website. So thanks so much for joining us today."

            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid start to the year, with growth driven by our livestock business and strong international market performance. Echoing Kristin's comment, our Q1 results are in-line with our expectations. As we indicated on our Q4 earnings call, we expected the first quarter to be below the low end of our forecasted annual operational growth rate of 6% for 2023. In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2 billion growing 1% on a reported basis and 4% on an operational basis. Adjusted net income of $607 million declined 3% on both a reported and an operational basis. Of the 4% operational revenue growth, 5%age from price with a 1% decline in volume. The volume decline is driven primarily by U.S. companion animal distributor destocking in the quarter. Our livestock portfolio led the way in terms of species growth growing 12% operationally with companion animal revenues flat on an operational basis in the quarter. Livestock growth was broad based with double-digit operational growth across cattle, poultry, sheep and fish. The growth in cattle was driven by additional supply of key products in the U.S. We saw growth in our poultry portfolio driven by higher sales of vaccines. Our sheep products benefited from favorable market conditions in Australia as well as our acquisition of Jurox in the fourth quarter of 2022. Finally, our fish portfolio continues to perform well with double-digit operational growth driven by strong vaccine performance in Norway. Sales of our companion animal products were flat operationally in the quarter, with growth in our monoclonal antibody products, Cytopoint, Librela and Solensia, offsetting declines in Apoquel, parasiticides and anti-infectives. Our monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, Librela and Solensia posted $51 million in revenue globally in the quarter, with strong demand for both products. Additionally, Solensia benefited from our U.S. launch in the third quarter last year. As for Librela in the U.S. we still anticipate approval in the first half of this year with the launch later in the second half. Simparica Trio posted global revenue of $151 million in the quarter, representing an operational decline of 7% versus the comparable 2022 period. This was primarily the result of U.S. distributor destocking during the quarter, as well as pre-price increased buy-in and promotional activity during the fourth quarter. This decline was partially offset by growth in our international markets from increased clinic penetration and launches in new markets. Our key dermatology portfolio declined 3% percent operation only with $290 million in global revenue. This decline is attributed to the impact of pre-price increased buy-ins in the U.S. in Q4, and in Japan in the comparable period in 2022. Cytopoint partially offset this decline with double-digit growth based on continued veterinary preference for injectables, which keep revenues in the clinic. Cytopoint better reflects underlying market demand due to our direct sales model on our dermatology portfolio and the lack of retail channel impacts. While we do believe conversion from Apoquel to Cytopoint may be accelerating, our overall outlook for our key dermatology portfolio remains unchanged. Our companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 3% operationally, with declines in the U.S. partially offset by growth internationally. Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1 billion in the quarter declining 1% with companion animal products declining 7% and livestock sales growing 15%. Companion animal performance in the quarter is reflective of the expectations we set in the prior quarter and is a result of distributor inventory and promotional impacts. As Kristin mentioned, demand for the veterinary market as demonstrated by distributor sales to clinics is healthy and growing. We continue to see robust sales outgrowth across our companion animal portfolio, including strong growth in parasiticides and our key dermatology products and our outlook for the full year remains unchanged. U.S. vet practice trends are improving, with clinic visits up 2% in the quarter and clinic revenue growth up 11%. Average revenue per visit is up 9%. These trends are slightly better than we expected and largely reflect the normalization of the COVID impact on vet clinic visits. Total visits in the quarter remain above pre-pandemic levels and clinic revenues have grown on average of 10% annually over that period. Spent per visit remains elevated as the standard-of-care continues to increase. Turning to product performance, the companion animal decline in the U.S. was driven largely by a decrease in sales of our parasiticides portfolio as well as key dermatology products. Simparica Trio posted sales of $127 million in the quarter, declining 13% driven by distributor destocking, partially offset by growth in patient share where we continue to outpace the overall flea, tick, and heartworm market. Our outlook for Trio remains unchanged as we continue to see strong customer demand and continued conversion from topicals and collars. Key dermatology products sales were $184 million for the quarter declining 5%. Apoquel sales were negatively impacted by high sales in Q4 ahead of our 2023 price increases and significant retail buy-in in Q1 2022. Cytopoint sales growth partially offset the Apoquel decline due largely to its injectable administration, which is preferred by clinics. The U.S. companion animal decline was partially offset by growth in sales of Solensia, which launched in the third quarter. We continue to see solid clinic penetration growth in Solensia and expect to drive awareness of feline OA through our DTC advertising campaigns. U.S. livestock grew 15% in the quarter, primarily resulting from our cattle business where we have improved several supply outages, which impacted our revenues throughout 2022 and replenished our channel partner inventories. While we will continue to see benefit from improved supply, the replenishment impact is largely isolated to this quarter. We also saw growth in Synovex due to expanded label claims. Our poultry business also contributed to growth driven by expanded sales of vaccines. Moving on to our international segment, where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 10% operationally in the quarter with companion animal and livestock revenue both growing 10%. Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from our monoclonal antibodies for alleviation of osteoarthritis pain, small animal parasiticides, as well as the impact of our Jurox acquisition, which was completed in the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of Librela and Solensia. Librela generated $34 million or 74% operational growth driven by strong underlying demand and the removal of supply allocations that were in-place for the first half of 2022. Solensia delivered $9 million in the first quarter sales internationally, driven by stronger demand. Simparica Trio was the top contributor to growth for our international small animal parasiticides with $24 million in revenue growing 47% operationally due to expanding market share in the flea, tick, and heartworm space. Our international key dermatology portfolio was flat operational in the quarter. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. However, this growth was offset by large pre-priced buy-ups of Apoquel in Japan in Q1 2022. Our international livestock segment also grew 10% operational in the quarter with growth in four of our five core species. Growth was driven by our cattle portfolio, which benefited from price increases in certain emerging markets. Our sheep business had an exceptional quarter with high demand in Australia due to favorable market conditions as well as the impact of our Jurox acquisition. Poultry also contributed to growth in the quarter with higher key account penetration in the Middle East and Eastern Europe as well as the benefit of price. And lastly, our fish portfolio continues to perform well, driven by growth in salmon vaccines in Norway. Swine was flat for the quarter with strong sales in China, partially offset by intermittent supply constraints in some markets. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.8% declined 80 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year, resulting from higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable product mix. This was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange and price increases. Adjusted operating expenses increased 12% operationally with SG&A growth of 11% operationally driven by headcount related compensation costs as a result of our U.S. small animal field force expansion, which largely began in Q2 of 2022, and higher T&E. R&D grew 19% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend for our pipeline candidates, advancing projects include disruptive, novel innovation and lifecycle management. R&D remains our first priority in capital allocation. Other income and deductions in the quarter are reflective of a favorable benefit associated with a settlement in the current period for prior period underpaid royalties related to sales of certain products. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5% an increase of 160 basis points driven by lower net discrete tax benefits in the quarter and less favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings, partially offset by higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign derived intangible income. And finally, adjusted net income declined 3% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS declined 1% operationally for the quarter. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $223 million. We are still anticipating a significant increase in capital expenditures for the full year of 2023. We continue to make investments to support our future growth, including manufacturing capacity for monoclonal antibodies as well as oral solid dosage. In the quarter, we repurchased $283 million of Zoetis shares and grew a dividend over 15% versus Q1 2022. Now, moving on to guidance for the full year 2023. As we have mentioned, the first quarter has gone largely as we expected. We are therefore reaffirming our 2023 guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. Foreign exchange rates have been volatile over the quarter. We will continue to monitor the impact of this volatility going forward. For the year, we continue to expect revenue between $8.575 billion and $8.725 billion representing a range of 6% to 8% operational growth. We also continue to expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.49 billion to $2.54 billion representing operational growth of 7% to 9%. And finally, we expected this adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.03 to $5.14, both consistent with our February guidance. Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year guidance commitments and expect more normalized growth in subsequent quarters. We continue to see positive trends and solid fundamentals in the underlying demand and are confident that our innovative portfolio will continue to allow us to go in-line with or faster than the market. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Sure. Jon, the start of your question was, are we at normalized levels, I'll start there, first? And yes, we're at normalized levels here sitting here in the second quarter. And let me just step back and give you a little bit more details here. As Kristin said, we came into the year and as you may recall on the last call, we described how we saw increased buy-in in the fourth quarter. Driven by promotions that we ran on parasiticides, given we have recovery of supply late in the year, as we got through some of our supply constraints. And there was more pre-priced buy-in given the level of pricing pieces we're coming into 2023 with, in the fourth quarter above what I would call normal levels pre-price buy-in. So, we expected to see destocking in the quarter, which is why we said that the first quarter would be below the low end of the range of growth that we have for the year at 6% to 8%. So we've seen destocking in the first quarter down to I would say the lower end of our normal range that we've experienced historically. And as we step into -- and by the way, given rising interest rates, that is not unexpected. And then as we got into April, we saw slightly more destocking as we started the quarter, but those have normalized and have been reflected in the guidance that we just reiterated today. And so we're not anticipating a return back to normal levels in terms of inventories or assumption in our guidance is that they'll stay about where they are now. Now to be clear, if you look at the end market demand dynamics, they remain very strong. As we said in our earnings release, sales out of distributors into clinics were up 8% on a volume basis in the quarter. And if you look at retail, sales out pet owners were up 35% on the quarter. We've seen for the first time in about a year vet visit increased by 2%, and if you look at derm patients, for example, visit increased in the quarter versus a year ago. And so again, we've seen normalization since then, and by the way, international markets where we didn't see -- we haven't seen and don't expect to see the level of destocking that we've seen in the U.S. you saw 10% operational growth in our international markets across livestock and companion animal. And so again, without an extremely return to those levels and these are factored into our guidance, and we're contemplated when we gave the initial guidance back in February. Yes, I would just add that first quarter is non-indicative of the year here, Aaron, similar to the overall results. And so to your point around retail channels, etcetera, we don't see us changing that. I think the fact that, Cytopoint we expect to continue to lead the growth for key derm franchise, we'll change the mix between those two. But not changing the overall picture and our expectations for derm remain the same for the rest of the year. And we're off to actually a strong start. In the second quarter for derm both in the U.S. and internationally. Hey, Mike. I'll start with progression for top line for the year and then I'll turn it over to Kristen. And she'll cover Librela launch in sure competition. So with respect to progression for the balance of the year, we expect normalized growth across the year starting with the second quarter, which obviously we're already about halfway into the second quarter. And as I mentioned just a little bit ago, we've got a strong start particularly in derm but across the board to what I'll call more normalized mix and normalized cadence for the balance of the year. One thing I would say is with respect to Q2, and that's normalized operational growth rate I'm referring to. If you take a look at FX, for example, that was about three points of headwind in the first quarter based on where rates are right now, I would expect about two points of headwind on the second quarter. So when you map out operational growth to reported growth, you should take that into consideration. That turns around in the second half again based on where rates are now and it ends up being slightly unfavorable on the year, year-on-year on FX on the top line and slightly favorable at the bottom line. So that's how I would sort of think through the progression. But again, starting with the second quarter, you should expect normalized growth to get to the guidance that we just reiterated at 6% to 8%. Yes. So look, I'll be happy to answer the question as to destocking. We saw destocking from the start of the quarter just as we anticipated and as we discussed in some of prior call given the dynamics coming out of Q4. As we mentioned too in the last call, the timing of our supply recovery in terms of last year would have had an impact on the cadence on the year, which is playing out exactly as we thought. I'll give you a little bit more color perhaps that might be helpful if you think about what the end market demand looks like. When we look at our sales out of distribution to clinics, we said its 8% volume growth on the quarter. If you look at how those played out for March, the end of the quarter, they're actually above that number. So, we haven't seen anything in terms of what the end markets are that would indicate a slowdown. And as I said, we've had a strong start to the second quarter and we're sitting here in the middle of the second quarter, and I'm saying that we would see normalized growth starting in this current quarter for the balance of the year. Yes, happy to, Kristen. So look on diagnostics, we have seen increased productivity from our diagnostics team, particularly if you look at the U.S. where we made the change about a year ago into the second quarter. In this first quarter, we actually saw very strong placements across our instruments, including images as well. Those will help drive growth from a consumables perspective if you look at the rest of the year consistent with our guidance, we said we would expect to see improvements in terms of that to the productivity given the new field force and the change out that we did last year. And we would expect to see return to growth in the U.S. in the back half of this year. And again, we're lapping those changes that we made, which we believe -- firmly believe are going to drive long term growth for the business in addition to innovation that we continue to work on in terms of diagnostics. Yes, look, I think there were couple other parts to your question, I'll touch on in terms of livestock. We're not seeing the same dynamics in livestock. Look, I mean if you look at where we ended last year, maybe we're in the middle of the range towards the bottom of the range, might have been slightly increase in the quarter given the recovery of some supply for certain products as we mentioned in our prepared commentary, but overall, not any meaningful movement there to speak of. And then with respect to our balance sheet on inventory, as you know, we are ramping up certain products, anticipating launch and approval of certain other products that will continue to drive inventories. First, if you look at operating cash flows on the quarter, they're actually favourable to last year because as inventories continue to increase, we saw really strong performance on receivables and other NAP. So overall, operating cash flows look favorable versus a year ago. Yes, I'd be happy to. So look, the derm story is similar in terms of destocking from pre-price buy-ins that we saw in the U.S. into retail in Q4. As well as a year ago, if you look at Japan and if you look at our reporting last year in Q1, you would have seen a significant growth rate for Japan in the first quarter, driven by those pre-price buy ups in Apoquel. And then you saw that go the other way in the second quarter. So if you were to I would say pro form the results for the first quarter taking into account what I just said, you will see double digit growth for the derm franchise in both the U.S. and international. Yes, sure. Look, we have not seen any pressure in terms of end market demand given our price increases. We took 5% price on the quarter that's up versus 3% last year. If you look at the end market dynamics that we described earlier, you're seeing significant growth out from distributors to clinics, but also importantly, you're seeing significant growth from retail into pet owners. And we continue to see increased patient visits, for example, in derm, etcetera. So we have not seen any resistance there in terms of price increase. And by the way, if you look at international, we grew 10% in companion animal in the quarter given price increases as well and despite some pre-price buy in, which is normal in the fourth quarter. So we haven't seen any signs of that. If you look at livestock, that actually offsets some of the -- marginally offset some of the price increases we would have seen in companion animal. We can just see some impact on Draxxin, but not meaningful not at the level that we've seen previously as we previously said and actually we saw some volume offset to that positively offsetting some of the price on the Draxxin side. So all told in good shape in terms of what we're seeing in terms of market reaction to our prices. And in terms of what it means for 2024, too early to tell. We won't go into that yet. So look, if you look at the end market dynamics that we see, we see strength there, so I think that supports certainly the mid to high end of our guidance I would say. If you look at what it means for the rest of the year and I'll reiterate this point, which is we're already halfway through the second quarter. And again, we're seeing strong start to the quarter and we'll see that normalized growth rate including mix by the way for the balance of the year. And keep in mind, right, our guidance didn't change including what we expect from livestock for the balance of the year. Right? We went from saying livestock could be minus one to plus one. We're saying it's flattish, basically the same thing. So how Q1 has played out exactly as we thought essentially and therefore the rest of the year is the same. And so no point in our guidance range is any, I would say, more probable than the other, we feel great about where we are on the year. And how it's starting out for us in the second quarter, particularly, despite what you described as the noise in terms of the inventory levels."

Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.\nSteve Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Monday, November 4, 2024. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. And with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.\nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our 2024 third quarter earnings call. Let me start by thanking our dedicated purpose-driven colleagues who helped us deliver another excellent quarter. Building on the strong momentum from the first half of the year, revenue grew 14% operationally and adjusted net income is up 15% operationally. We saw balanced double-digit growth across the business. Driven by steady demand for our key franchises, U.S. grew 15% and international revenue grew 13% operationally. Our innovative companion animal portfolio grew 15% operationally, while livestock grew 11% on an operational basis. Our consistent growth is fueled by a diverse, durable, and science-driven portfolio, carefully crafted through a deep understanding of our customers' evolving needs. By maintaining a strong focus on innovation, we set the standard for improving patient outcomes, higher customer satisfaction, and strong partnerships with veterinarians and pet owners. Our osteoarthritis pain franchise, Librela and Solensia, continues to make a transformative impact by addressing a critical unmet need, delivering 97% operational revenue growth globally. From our conversations with customers around the world, it's clear that our safe effective solutions are making a meaningful difference in patients' lives. We recognize the profound impact of our work, which only strengthens our commitment to developing this market. We have navigated this path before and understand that building a new category of care requires a steady strategic approach. As we lap the U.S. Librela launch, we continue to grow share, even in a market where canine pain visits typically slow down from Q2 to Q3. In fact, Librela is actively disrupting this trend by driving more clinic visits and increasing engagement. With $55 million in U.S. quarterly sales, we see significant opportunity to further expand share and utilization. In just 11 months, we have treated 1 million dogs, compared to an estimated 8 million receiving other treatments, and Librela have already become the fourth largest product in U.S. pet care. This highlights the demand and long-term growth potential, reinforcing our confidence in the franchise's $1 billion trajectory. With record market penetration in the U.S., we're only scratching the surface of broader utilization potential. We estimate that an additional 17 million dogs are suffering from untreated OA. That's because before Librela, NSAIDs were the only option for vets, which many untreated dogs could not tolerate due to pre-existing conditions. Globally, Librela opportunity is equally significant, with OA pain estimated to affect nearly 40% of dogs. And importantly, in the U.S., we see a similar non-linear growth curve to Europe, where revenue grew 18% operationally year-over-year, in year four of launch. Given our results there, we are poised to create and expand this market domestically. Drawing on that experience is key to positioning Librela as the preferred pain treatment by highlighting its safe, effective, and convenient choice for vets. We will leverage our strong partnerships and continue collaborating with veterinarians to expand treatment adoption, shifting away from two decades of reliance on NSAIDs. Results and trends like these reaffirm what we've long understood. The human-animal bond is undeniable. Today's generation of pet owners see their pets as integral members of their family and expects human-quality care. Monoclonal antibodies, increasingly important in human health, are a prime example of how we are bringing that same kind of innovation to animal health with treatments like Librela and Solensia. Our Simparica franchise continues to deliver impressive results as well, growing 27% operationally. While our science-backed innovations have created entirely new categories in animal health, we have also set the standard for competing in established markets. Through close collaboration with customers, we understood that overcoming first-mover advantage requires two differentiations, and long-term loyalty is earned with products that stand out in both safety and efficacy. The success of our Simparica franchise expanded the total parasiticides market and demonstrated that improving patient outcomes is not zero-sum, especially with significant unmet needs. In 2020, we pioneered the U.S. triple-combination parasite market with Simparica Trio, offering comprehensive protection against fleas, ticks, and heartworms in one monthly chewable. Trio is now the number one vet-prescribed parasiticide, with over 13 million dogs treated in just four years, and 86% of pet owners report high satisfaction. Despite increased competition, Trio prescription rates continue to climb as triple-combination products are gaining share, supported by our field force's scale and excellence in driving customer engagement. And our commitment to making our products accessible through the most convenient channels for pet owners has solidified Trio's retail leadership. Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate a dynamic landscape, but perceive two key outcomes. First, consistent with historic trends, the overall addressable market will grow. Second, having more options will accelerate education of vets and pet owners. Increasing awareness of the benefits of broad-spectrum protection will drive conversion to triple-combination treatments. With our significant head start, proven efficacy, and convenience, along with our trusted relationships, we believe Simparica Trio will remain the preferred choice, even as new products enter the market. Similarly, 16% operational revenue growth across our key dermatology franchise demonstrates how disruptive innovation and strategic lifecycle enhancement drive sustained growth. Over a decade ago, we identified a crucial unmet need in veterinary medicine, a solution for canine dermatological itch that balanced safety and efficacy. Itch impacts the well-being of both pets and their owners. It's heartbreaking to see dogs struggling to find relief from persistent discomfort. We were first to address this challenge. Thanks to our relentless focus on innovation and execution, in just a decade, the market grew from $70 million to over $1.5 billion and growing. But we didn't just enter the market, we built it, cultivated it, and continuously evolved it, creating the industry's first $1 billion franchise. As a result, today, Apoquel is the number one prescribed medication in animal health, and the market and our customers have grown alongside us. And when vets wanted other options, we delivered truly differentiated first-line treatments like Cytopoint, the first monoclonal antibody to treat itch, and Apoquel Chew, a convenient chewable that enhances compliance. These therapies are trusted by veterinarians worldwide, bringing relief to over 23 million dogs globally, and we believe they are the best treatment options. And it's not only our product portfolio that sets us apart, it's our customer-focused approach to development. Vets trust our products for their rigorous safety standards and confidence in dosing regimens that allow for chronic uninterrupted use. Our research-driven approach to JAK inhibition selectively ensured that our treatments can be used safely alongside other medications, including vaccines. With over 20 million dogs globally with untreated or undertreated itch, the derm market growth potential is vast. Our proven performance reflects our commitment to expanding access and providing trusted first-line solutions. Similar to our experience in paras, we expect optionality will grow the overall market, a market where Zoetis has two first-line treatments that are known for being safe, effective and trusted. Even with alternatives, satisfied customers are far less likely to switch, and we continue to deliver the solutions they trust and rely on. Innovation, execution and a relentless focus on customer needs are the cornerstones of our key market-leading franchises. Turning to livestock, we recently closed the sale of our Medicated Feed Additive and certain water-soluble product portfolios to Phibro Animal Health. This transaction is a prime example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy, allowing us to focus our investments on areas with the highest-growth potential aligned with our core capabilities. We remain deeply committed to livestock, sharpening our focus on key areas of innovation, including preventatives, antibiotic alternatives and genetics. For example, in September, we announced a strategic partnership with Danone to leverage Zoetis' genetic testing capabilities in promoting sustainable dairy production. This collaboration aims to help dairy producers and Danone's global supply-chain improve animal health and productivity with a focus on animal well-being. This strengthens long-term industry resilience, while also reducing environmental impact. Looking ahead, we anticipate the livestock industry to grow 2% to 4% annually, and we aim to be at the higher end of that range. Innovation will be a key driver of that growth. And to that end, we have updated our guidance to reflect strong performance across our key franchises, along with impact primarily from the MFA divestiture. Wetteny will guide into the details there. With 12% operational revenue growth through the first three quarters, we have outpaced our initial expectations, a testament to our agility in navigating a complex environment. As we look to Q4, we anticipate a return to our previous levels of above-market growth and remain on-track to meet our revised full-year guidance with strong momentum going into 2025. This quarter's results highlight the strength of our diverse, durable portfolio and unwavering commitment to delivering for our customers. Before I close, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to our colleagues. They embody our purpose, support our customers and drive our exceptional performance. Their dedication is what truly makes the difference. With their passion and commitment, we feel positive about our ability to deliver on the four key tenets of our value proposition, to grow revenue faster than the market, to invest in innovation and growth capabilities, to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue, and to return excess capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Wetteny.\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. To reiterate, innovation and execution underpinned an excellent third quarter, driven by the strength of our diverse and differentiated portfolio. Another quarter of double-digit operational growth across species and geographies. The remarkable performance of our companion animal portfolio highlights the willingness of pet owners to spend on the health and well-being of their pets and the value of our products to pet owners and veterinary practices. Our livestock growth underscores the essential and growing need for animal protein around the world, and the important role our products play in helping producers keep their herds healthy. Put simply, we provide critical solutions central to animal health. Our success is directly tied to our customers, and our first-to-market innovations continue to fuel the growth and success of their practices. In the third quarter, we posted $2.4 billion in revenue, growing 11% on a reported basis and 14% operationally, with 8% driven by volume and 6% from price. Adjusted net income of $716 million grew 14% on a reported basis and 15% operationally. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, OP pain mAbs contributed $151 million. Our Simparica franchise posted $333 million, and our key dermatology franchise contributed revenue of $449 million. Our lifestyle portfolio also contributed strong growth with $758 million in revenue. Regarding our OP pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia, in Europe, after just 3.5 years on the market, Librela and Solensia are the leading treatments for OA pain and are driving market expansion by broadening treatment options across cases. As Kristin mentioned, many of these patients were previously untreated because they could not tolerate NSAIDs. In Europe and the U.S., Librela expansion into this patient group represents a significant market growth opportunity. In the U.S., the growing importance of mAbs cannot be understated. While overall U.S. clinic visits are down, particularly for prescription-only visits that are moving to alternative channels, therapeutic visits such as those for OA are on the rise. In the U.S., Librela has brought almost 0.5 million new patients to the OA pain category since launch by expanding the market with a new standard-of-care. Our performance within the Simparica franchise highlights our ability to meet the evolving needs of pet owners by delivering safe, effective products to convenient channels such as retail, where Trio is the top-selling pharmaceutical. Parasiticides is the largest, most competitive therapeutic category in animal health, and we have substantially increased our market share by being the first-to-market in the U.S. with a trusted differentiated product. Since the launch of Trio, we have gone from number five in this category to number two with clear triple combination market leadership. And in the first year of competition in U.S. triple combinations, we grew revenue by more than 25% and increased our market share. In the U.S., we estimate almost 60% of medicalized dogs are not on triple combination products. The increased share of voice for new entrants should accelerate the shift to triple combinations, where we have a first-to-market advantage. We continue to win with puppies, where Trio is the preferred choice for these new patients, signaling strong growth potential. Earlier, Kristin highlighted the deliberate balance between safety and efficacy with our key dermatology products. Apoquel delivered on that and quickly became one of the most important products in clinics. We understood our customers wanted more convenient options for derm treatment, and we delivered. We have multiple derm products with unique value propositions for both the vet and the pet owner. All of our products can be used on acute, seasonal and chronic cases and have years of real-world vet and pet owner satisfaction. As we face new competition, we remain confident in our growth trajectory. We have proven experience defending established brands and we are confident that our portfolio of first-line treatments remain among the most important products in vet clinics. Now let's move to segment results. U.S. revenue grew 15% in the quarter with companion animal growing 18% and livestock growing 5%. U.S. companion animal performance was driven by our OA pain mAbs, including the launch of Librela, as well as continued adoption and compliance of Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise. We continue to grow above-market, driven by increased therapeutic treatment for OA and dermatology, veterinarian's preference for injectables and evolving pet owner preference for retail convenience and home delivery, which also boosts compliance with oral medications. Our OA pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia, posted a combined $73 million in U.S. sales in Q3. Librela generated $55 million, primarily on increased clinic utilization. Penetration has reached 85%, faster than any product in our history. A crucial first step-in our successful launch was ensuring clinic availability. And again, we are just scratching the surface with OA. Just as we've seen with our key dermatology franchise, addressing unmet needs with revolutionary treatment can deliver long-term growth, and we believe Librela will be a growth tailwind for years ahead. Solensia posted $18 million in revenue, or 50% growth. While the incidence rate for OA in cats is similar to dogs at around 40%, there were very few treatment options for cats prior to Solensia. Since Solensia's launch in the U.S. two years ago, we have seen feline OA patients increase over 70%. With current feline medicalization rates significantly lower than dogs, boosting feline treatment presents a significant untapped opportunity. Simparica Trio posted U.S. growth of 29%, with $237 million in revenue. We previously highlighted Trio's momentum through the first year with competition, and our expectations remain high. As we have seen with previous generations of parasiticides, secondary entrants serve to accelerate conversion from older therapies. But in the absence of meaningful differentiation, they do not erode market share. In addition to robust volume growth for Trio, we continue to see the benefit of price driven by our lower promotional environment, and more thoughtful discounting across our customer base. In U.S. key dermatology, we saw 17% growth, or $303 million, for the quarter. Apoquel was the largest driver with outsized contributions from the retail channel. Apoquel Chewable growth outpaced tablet cannibalization declines, benefiting from increased conversion and compliance. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by preference for injectables. U.S. livestock grew 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by volume growth in cattle, where we continue to see improved supply of [indiscernible]. This growth was partially offset by Draxxin price declines. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 7% on a reported basis and 13% operationally in the quarter. International livestock grew 15% operationally and companion animal grew 11% operationally. International livestock grew 15% operationally in the quarter with equal contributions from volume and price. Cattle was the largest growth contributor, driven by the impact of price in high inflationary markets, as well as volume growth from higher demand and improved supply. Poultry growth was driven by price and key account penetration. Lastly, fish saw strong volume growth in Norway, driven by high demand for our vaccines, as well as the impact of a soft comparable period last year. International companion animal growth was driven by our Simparica key dermatology and OA pain mAbs franchises. Our international Simparica franchise grew 28% operationally, with $75 million in sales. Performance was driven by Simparica Trio, growing 39% operationally to $31 million in sales, benefiting from key account growth in Europe, DTC and the positive impact of our Q1 China launch. Simparica grew 22% operationally on $44 million in sales, driven primarily by Eastern Europe and Brazil. Our international key dermatology franchise contributed $146 million of revenue and 13% operational growth, with double-digit operational growth in Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth was driven by Apoquel with strong DTC success, especially in European markets. Europe is also benefiting from strong adoption of Apoquel Chewable, where we now see more than half of doses dispensed coming from the chewable formulation. Our key dermatology franchise continues to expand internationally. Many countries are still in the early stages of derm market development and increases in medicalization as well as the benefits that chewable and injectables can offer, provide a significant run rate for growth. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 27% operationally, posting $78 million in combined revenue. International sales of Librela were $62 million, growing 26% operationally. The growth of Librela was driven by higher use in Europe, as well as market expansion and share gains in second-wave launch markets. We see opportunity for continued market expansion from converting existing NSAID patients and increasing months on therapy. Solensia sales were $16 million, growing 32% on an operational basis. Now moving on to the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 70.7% grew 20 basis points with increases from price and mix, offset by higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by SG&A expenses of 9% operationally, largely due to higher compensation-related expenses due to company performance. R&D grew 10% operationally in the quarter on higher compensation-related expenses due to company performance and increases in project spend related to internal portfolio advancements. Adjusted net income grew faster than revenue at 15% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2024. Our raised revenue guidance reflects continued strong performance of our key franchises, partially offset by a reduction to sales for the divestiture of our Medicated Feed Additive product portfolio and certain water soluble products completed October 31. As Kristin highlighted, we remain committed to livestock and see opportunities in several therapeutic areas, enhanced by our strategic partnerships and focus. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-October. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.2 billion and $9.3 billion, a range of 10% to 11% operational growth. This is both an increase and a narrowing of our revenue range versus our prior full year guidance. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.67 billion to $2.695 billion, representing operational growth of 13.5% to 14.5%. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.86 to $5.92 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.33 to $5.39. We have seen outstanding performance in 2024 thus far with broad-based growth from our key innovative products across species and geographies, and we remain very positive on the remainder of the year and beyond. Our guidance, combined with our year-to-date results, does signal some expected deceleration in our revenue growth rate for Q4 specifically. As a reminder, revenue growth in Q4 will be impacted by the MFA divestiture, reflecting a reduction of two months of U.S. sales and one month from our international business out of our results in Q4. Additionally, we also saw the impact of stocking from the launch of both Librela and Apoquel Chewable in Q4 of last year. Normalizing for these items, Q4 will be more in line with our historical growth rate. We remain confident in underlying demand and market dynamics as we move into the fourth quarter and then 2025. Our outlook for next year remains positive. We continue to see favorable trends in our key franchises, including OA, dermatology and Simparica, as well as momentum from alternative channels. While we anticipate the recent tailwinds from higher inflation to normalize, our recent performance has significantly outpaced price-driven gains alone. Additionally, we expect headwinds in China to normalize in Q4 and moving into next year. We estimate these headwinds have had approximately 1 percentage unfavorable impact to our growth this year that should normalize in 2025. We are confident in our continued ability to grow above the animal health market, driven by the strength of our portfolio, pipeline and our dedicated colleagues. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. We'll take our first question from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks for taking my question. A two parter here. So first on Librela, how should we be thinking about the quarterly progression from here in terms of U.S. Librela, and how has the experience been in terms of reorder rates, and the months on therapy relative to your internal expectations? And then, just how we should think about that quarterly progression given the stocking dynamics in the fourth quarter and into 2025. And then as we think about bigger picture here, just several moving pieces into 2025 from a profit perspective, I guess you continue to invest in innovation Librela scales, you have favorable mix also from MFA sale. Like how do you think about the level of investment that you need to make next year, and sort of how much you're going to let sort of the enhanced product mix, more skewed towards that companion animal actually flow through in terms of margin expansion next year as well. So how do you think about those headwinds, and tailwinds I guess into 2025? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks Erin. I'll start with overall Librela and move to Wetteny on sort of quarterly cadence, and the 2025 question you had. Look, we are really pleased with the performance globally with Librela with 123% growth, really remain committed to being a $1 billion franchise. And as you look at just the quarterly progression to-date, it's been the most successful launch in our company's history. In the U.S., we have an 85% penetration rate. Globally we're averaging over 90%. In the first 12 months, we've already got 1 million patients on the product, and we believe we've got a significant runway for growth. With only 1 million patients on that and 8 million still on NSAIDs. We think there's a really large addressable market. We can focus on higher compliance. So, we're very optimistic on that. I'll let Wetteny get into the quarterly cadence going forward as well as your 2025 question as well.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, Erin, as Kristin said, Librela has been our most successful launch in the history of the company by every metric that we look at in penetration and also the first 12 months revenue and approximately $192 million. Now as we don't tend to give guidance down to an individual product for an individual quarter. But what I would say in terms of the cadence of Librela, is that we'll continue to see and exiting this year into next year. We expect to see strong growth given our penetration. As Kristin said, about $1 million being treated, compared to NSAIDs that are at about 8 million. And so we know launching these major franchises, standards of care, take time. And one other item that is certainly clear, when you look at the historical visits around OA Pain, as Kristin said in the prepared commentary. We do tend to see a peak in Q2 coming down in Q3, and then typically comes back up a bit in Q4, but not to the level of Q2. So that's another element that I would give you to sort of consider as you think about, what to expect through the end of the year, and going into 2025. Now with respect to your second part of your question around considerations and profitability, et cetera. We continue to demonstrate an ability to grow above the animal health market. We certainly see that in our performance this year, on a year-to-date basis we're at 12%. We just raised guidance again for the third time this year, clearly well above the market, and are growing our just an income faster than our top line, including in this quarter, which as you recall last call. We highlighted the fact that we are increasing some of our investments, as we exit this year. And we still delivered faster adjusted income. And so as we look ahead, this is a core tenet of our value proposition that we'll continue to be mindful of, and we have the opportunity here as we look ahead to leverage investments we've made in the past, including field force investments in the U.S. And we see opportunity to continue to leverage those even as we continue to drive growth and launch products, across the market. We will continue to see some investments in DTC behind our key brands. Again, we're building a market, something we have demonstrated an ability to build the markets, expand them and defend them. If you look at what we're doing across our portfolio, right now. And an important part of that will be DTC and advertising promotion behind these products as we go into next year. We would anticipate again, as I've said before, the business has an inherent ability to grow the bottom line faster than the top. As you see the mix as well as price that we're able to take. How much we deliver in any given year may vary depending on the levels of investments we're making, but we may committed to growing the bottom line faster.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Great, thanks for taking the question guys. I want to follow-up on a couple of points you touched on there. First, just in the quarter, thinking about Librela progression year-to-date, I know you had some stocking destocking dynamics earlier in the year. Just making sure for Librela, for Trio, for Derm. Was there anything like that in the third quarter in terms of inventory management with customers, people stocking for year-end or maybe destocking any promotions, anything like that? I just want to make sure we're looking at \"clean numbers here\" especially with some competing launches going on for some of these things. And then two, I want to touch a little bit on the MFA component. You updated the guide for that divestment for the fourth quarter, as you touched on two months in the U.S. on OUS, how should we think about full year 2025 impact in terms of updating our numbers? I think it's roughly $350 million annual revenues. But any you can say in terms of how much SG&A spent, how much R&D spend falls into that, just so we can start to true up our models for next year? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. For starters, it was a clean quarter across our entire business in the U.S. and abroad. So there's no stocking dynamics or inventory buildups there. But I'll let Wetteny take the more detailed question on MFAs.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look to Kristin's point, if you look at inventory levels, particularly across distributors in the U.S., which we have visibility into, not as much visibility obviously across clinics individually. But our inventory levels remain closer to the low end of our historical averages, similar to where we were over a year ago in Q1, after the destocking. So I would say that. And then within Librela, keep in mind, this is a whole chain product that, is being shipped direct to clinics and not going through distribution. So it's really a product. And given our penetration levels that we highlighted two quarters ago, there's not incremental penetration to really influence inventory levels here. So I thought I would add that, to the answer you already received. With MFAs, just a reminder of what we have disclosed previously. This is a business last year 2023, full year did about $400 million at about 30% margin. So I think that gives you and by the way, seasonality here is roughly linear across the year. So if you look at the divestiture this year, it's about half of a quarter, with two months of the U.S. and one month of international. You can run the numbers here in terms of what the impact, is exiting this year. And then, what that would be for next year, because we'd have three and a half quarters in the number in 2024 that, we'll be comping against. And I think that should give you. Even though I'm not getting into specifics on SG&A versus R&D, et cetera, I think that gives you an impact on through the P&L.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brandon Vazquez of William Blair.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus on parasiticides and Simparica Trio. It's been a really strong segment for you guys, especially Trio. Can you talk a little bit about despite more competition in the market, why you guys seem to be taking care. Perhaps it's something on the commercial side, and maybe some of the execution you guys have there. So just any color there, and how much that can continue into 25'. And then the quick follow-up, is just if there's any Wetteny for you, if there's any price mix commentary you could give us on the quarter, especially in the companion animal side? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Brandon. Look, we're really proud of the performance of Trio. It is the number one prescribed parasiticide. It's already been used in over 13 million dogs. I think that the real focus here for us is Simparica growing 27% globally, is really having a phenomenal product. I think it starts with that. I think we were first to market with Trio, which I think has made a big difference. We've also been able to grow that product tremendously, leveraging alternative channels, which today is about 20% of that. But I think what's really underscoring all this, is that the oral flea tick and hardware market is growing 45% year-over-year. And that growth is moving more people into the oral category. And if you look at puppy share, which I think is a really good indicator of where we're going in the future. Trio has a 35% share in puppies. So I think between being a first mover advantage, having a phenomenal product that's got comprehensive coverage, it's convenient. It's a chewable. I think it's a great product. And look, we've partnered very closely with all of our customers, and certainly with our corporates. And I think you're seeing, the customers are really pleased with the product. So, we see strong momentum going into next year. And I'll underscore some of the comments that Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, which is what we've seen continuously as new entrants enter the market, is the expansion of the oral flea tick and hardware market and that is what we're expecting next year into 2025. So Wetteny, do you want to take the second half of the question?\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. In terms of price mix and volume here? As you heard in prepared commentary, the 14% operational growth in the quarter was 8% volume and 6% price. Now your question, if it's related specifically to our parasiticides in the Trio performance, I would say it's about balance, with slightly more volume than price. Here and keep in mind as we've stated previously, we have more targeted promotions as well as discounts to our customers. Which is actually driving better price realization, and not just price increases if you will here on this product, which again has been a phenomenal execution I would say, and contribution to the growth that you're seeing on Trio specifically.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Block of Stifel.\nJon Block: Thanks guys. Good morning. First one, are there any different marching orders for the sales force as U.S. Librela now largely moves from call it new practice adoption, to more driving utilization and getting into mild-to-moderate. Maybe the tack on to that would be any specific thoughts about 4Q revenue from U.S. Librela? Did you commit to q-over-q growth, because just wanted to follow-up there. That seems to be the only noise in the quarter quite honestly. And then, the second one would just be, any high level building blocks for 2025 revenue. Wetteny, you mentioned China headwinds of a point this year, I'm guessing for the most part that unwinds you've got Librela, their trajectory obviously some of the other key franchises. So again even at a high level any building blocks, for us to take into consideration? Thanks guys.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I would say there's not any new sales marching orders. I think it's a lot more of continuing to focus on getting clinics, have more experience across not just severe, but moving into moderate, which we started probably a little while ago. That was a key focus even for us at launch. So, we'll continue to focus on growing the brand there, but I think it's really sticking with the key messages of the safety of the product. The efficacy of the product and really, demonstrating continuously the opportunity to look at the 8 million patients currently on NSAIDs and switching those NSAIDs patients over to Librela, assuming that that's the right product for that pet overall. So, we remain very, very pleased with this launch, and given how pleased we are at the launch, I think we're going to continue down the same tactics that we have. Certainly now that we've got the penetration, it's really focusing on expanding the use out of just not just severe, but obviously in moderate as well as really talking about the opportunity, given the different pets medical needs to switch from NSAIDs. So I'll turn the second part of the question over to Wetteny on building blocks for '25.\nWetteny Joseph: Sure Jon. Look, we look forward to sharing our 2025 guidance on our next call in February, and just maybe a few reminders here that might be helpful in terms of directionally where we're headed, right. We have several sources of growth and we continue to see strong underlying demand, across our portfolio in most markets where we operate. Our outlook for derm and for Trio remain very positive, exiting this year and going into next year. We expect to see continued strong growth, across our OA pain franchise on a year-over-year basis. And even if you have more normalized pricing, we would expect those to be above, slightly above our historical pricing contribution of 2% to 3%. And as I covered in the prepared commentary, China will be more normalized as we exit this year starting in Q4, and into the next year. And so, you have less of a headwind going into next year, which was almost a full point in the current year. The last piece I would give is just reminder on the MFA and water soluble product portfolio. Removing those and I shared those numbers already in terms of what - those products did last year. So hopefully that's helpful, in terms of getting you into some sort of ballpark here.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Westenberg of Piper Sandler.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi, thank you for taking the question, and congrats on a great quarter. So a little bit touch on macro real quick just in terms of how you price relative to veterinary CPI, is that ever a consideration? And as we go into next year, do you also consider some of the clinic growth assumptions that we've seen? Yes, you are isolated in a lot of ways, because you can buy off channel. However, those initial scripts do need to come on visits, and we've seen visits for the last year being quite down. Now and then just a second on a clarification, Wetteny, I think you said in your prepared remarks reasonable promotion environment, or something along the lines of that. Can you clarify what you mean? If you meant Zoetis and industry wide. And specifically, I'm thinking about some of the promotion environments, beginning of next year, as we enter parasiticide season, you'll have a full season of Quattro. You might be lapping some of the promotions from NexGard Plus, I don't know anything like that. So if I could just get a clarity there? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, David. I'll start with your first one. And Wetteny, if I miss anything, please build on it. As we think about pricing, obviously we start with the pricing environment, and the overall inflation environment in any given market where we compete. But the primary thing that we really focus on, is a product-by-product, SKU-by-SKU view of our differentiation and the marketplace overall. I know you referenced that visits were down. We continue to say visits are not a good proxy for how animal health and more particularly how Zoetis does. Really what you're seeing is some of those wellness visits, and a lot of those are products, pickup products, visits. And a lot of that is going over to the alternative channel, which continues to grow very strongly. But if you look at the visits for our particular products around derm or around pain, they're up. And so, I think we really focus on what is the innovation and what is the value that our product provides, to both the vet and the pet owner. And I think that is what really primarily drives our pricing strategy overall. I'll turn the second question on the pricing - the promotional environment to you, Wetteny.\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, the only thing I would add to the visits, is even as overall visits are down in the U.S. If you look at the key therapeutic areas for us, OA Pain business up double-digits. Derm visits are up even as more and more of our Apoquel products, are being sold through the retail channel. So I think that really spells it and consistent with what we've been sharing for some time now. And then if you look at alternative channels, it has been a significant growth driver for us across the U.S. pet care, which, of course, reduces some of the dependency on clearing visits, as well as the auto-ship and higher compliance that, that drives. Alternative channels were up actually 34% year-on-year on the quarter, again, demonstrating that point. As far as promotional activities, my comment here is you see far more disciplined promotional environment this year, particularly when you compare it to last year, when we were up against a new competitor in the civil combination parasiticide space. So that comment really is to say, there's not as much promotional activity here, and that we are more targeted in terms of our discounting to our customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Balaji Prasad of Barclays.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Two from me, one speaking a bit more about 2025. Could you comment about - comment on the incremental growth drivers and headwinds, especially that you see in 2025. And Wetteny, especially as we think about OpEx, again, I don't want to get into guidance, but if you can just comment on the pushes and pulls towards your OpEx spend in the year. Secondly, with regard to Simparica Trio again, can you comment on what kind of move - in terms of the $57 million - 57 million dogs that you have provided that could move to isoxazolines. What's the pace of conversion that could be achieved on a real estate basis? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. Wetteny, do you want to take this?\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. The first point in terms of next year, and again, I look forward to providing more specific guidance in February here. Balaji, look, I think as we've said at Investor Day, we see opportunity to leverage our SG&A from an OpEx perspective. We have been running R&D driven by our portfolio, and our pipeline progression faster than revenue. I think you see that coming in closer to revenue this year. We'll get into more detail in that in terms of what we would expect into next year, but that's certainly one consideration. I think when I think about other pushes and pulls, there's been a lot of conversations around Argentina this year. I think one thing to keep in mind is, as we have highlighted, the pricing that we have taken in Argentina this year you get in other hyperinflationary markets for that matter. Again, if you expect a more normalized pricing environment, and we would anticipate slightly above where our historical rate is, that incremental price you see from Argentina this year, which is actually on a declining basis. So Q1 was the peak we've come down in Q2 and in Q3, and we expect Q4 to be closer to 1%. I think that would be an item to consider as we go through next year. But one important point though is if you work down the P&L that, has actually had significant headwinds through inflation, through the middle of the P&L. And then from an FX perspective, if you look at the reported results, the net impact of Argentina year-over-year, is actually negative across the P&L. So I think that's really important points to keep in mind, as you're thinking about SG&A? And then the other point on - as we look at the parasiticide market, and what we expect to happen here, we've seen this before. This is the same that we saw, say, almost a decade ago with the launch of all isoxazolines, you saw really continual transition into those that continue to grow the market substantially. And clearly, when we look at the percentage of puppies that are getting put on a triple combination, which is much higher than the overall percentage of dogs that are on paras. So about a third of the prescription parasiticides are in triple combinations, but over 50% of puppies are. And so that gives you a strong indication, of what's going to continue to happen in that market. The split between how much is going from other orals versus collars and topic is not something we have a specificity on, but needless to say, that is where the market is going is towards those triple combinations.\nKristin Peck: Yes. And Balaji, I would just encourage you to look at our slides from today, because we show you some of the graphs of what that actually looks like. And I think with a double-digit growth the fourth year on the market, I think it speaks for itself as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo of Jefferies.\nGlen Santangelo: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Kristin, it sounds like the company is confident in its ability to take another year of above-average price increases. And I'm kind of curious like what's sort of given you that confidence, and given the evolving competitive landscape and current macro climate? And then just a sort of part of that, could you give us an update on what percentage of the companion business, is flowing through alternate site versus the vet office, and if that's having any impact on any sort of pricing, or customer trends that we should be aware of? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with your second question. Retail grew 34%. I think it's a little bit over. I mean, Wetteny, you can correct me, around 10% of the U.S. business at this point? What is it a little higher?\nWetteny Joseph: It's closer to 15%. If you look at all alternative channels, that's retail online as well as brick and mortar and home, home delivery as well combined.\nKristin Peck: Yes. No, I think it's growing very strongly in the U.S. I mean, look, as we look at overall pricing, again, I'd go back to where I started before, which is look product-by-product and the innovation we're bringing. And I think what we've really talked about continuously is the diverse, durable and innovative portfolio that Zoetis has across species and globally. And so that's how we price our products. And we've continued, as we've seen competition, for example in parasiticides, been continuously taking price there as well where we see the convenience and the benefits that Simparica Trio offer. So, I don't have anything new to add here. I'm not sure Wetteny, if you do.\nWetteny Joseph: Look, I think if you look at this year, right, we are taking price. If you take Argentina out, it's somewhere in the 4.5% to 5% range across the rest of our portfolio, right? And despite that, you see significant volume growth. This quarter, I think, is a testament to that 8% volume growth and 6% price. And so, if you look at our key product areas, actually derm you see price as well as substantial volume growth. So we think there's room for us to continue that, given the value that we bring with these innovations.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Great, thanks. Just two questions from me. Maybe first on Apoquel, can you just elaborate a little bit about how you're thinking about the impact from the Zenrelia launch - and maybe specifically, should we anticipate any slowdown to your growth due to some of their promotion activities, are you expecting relatively limited impact there? And then my second question would be on Librela uptake. Just any comments on how U.S. compliance is trending relative to your expectations? I know it's early, but just anything notable in some of those initial trends? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start with Apoquel and then Wetteny, if you want to build on Librela uptake question. Yes, I mean another strong quarter, obviously, from Apoquel had 16% growth across the quarter. I think it's the number one product out there. It's got 11 years of safety, huge satisfaction rates across both consumers and veterinarians, with a 90% satisfaction rate. And I think our focus with the product, is continuing to grow the category. We think there's an opportunity for higher compliance, to address under or untreated dogs, to convert to 3 million dogs or on other treatments and 8 million dogs currently not on therapy. We're very confident in our ability to compete with this product given the satisfaction, given the safety and given the efficacy overall. We're very proud of the performance of this, and we look forward to strong performance obviously going forward in 2025 and beyond. You want to take - the update?\nWetteny Joseph: Yes, sure. Look, I think as we've said before, this is our most successful launch cover in the company's history. And I think while it's a little bit early, to get into a ton of detail around compliance in the U.S. specifically. I always like to look at our international markets, which will continue to see strong double-digit growth across those markets for years out. And when we look at the transition into more moderate cases, which now represent more than 60% of our - of cases in - across Europe, for example, that's driving up much on therapy, to be above seven months. And compliance rates that are exceptionally high in that market. So I think this gives you an indication of where the market is, and given the efficacy and the revolutionary profile of this product, what it can do and what is actually doing across markets outside the U.S., and we're very pleased with where we are in the launch trajectory here in the U.S. as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Scala of TD Cowen.\nChris LoBianco: Hi. This is Chris on for Steve Scala. Congrats on the strong quarter and thanks for taking our questions. We had two first, Zoetis has its best confidence in above-industry average sales growth, what is your level of confidence in being able to maintain this growth long-term based only on current on-market products, without contributions from pipeline of business development? And then second, how many competitive matches are you expecting in 2025? And how is this uncertainty impacting your thoughts on how conservative initial 2025 guidance will be? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. I'll give that a shot. Look, I think if you look at our history over a decade, we have outperformed the market by three points on average. I would argue, if you look at the market growth rates this year, it's even above that. Now your question is how - what's our confidence level and be able to sustain that. We're very confident in our ability to sustain that given our existing portfolio. And bifurcating between existing portfolio and new launches is not something I'm going to venture into, because that is ingrained into how we go to market, and how we continue to invest in solving for our customers' greatest challenges. It's hard for me to give you what the growth rate would be without that. But what I would say is it's really important to note that it's not only when we launch, a brand new innovation in a new area. Is a continued life cycle innovation that we drive, which is almost historically 50% of our R&D spend. So we continue to grow the market and expand the market, adding additional claims as we go along the way, which is how we, over time, build markets. And I know there's a lot of questions around sequential growth, et cetera, it's not really about the sequential growth. It's never really super linear it's over time, building the market that once you build it, it's also very sticky, because you've established the standard and someone else has to come with something that is significantly differentiated in order to overtake you. And that's what drives our business. So, we're very confident in continuing to be able to outperform the industry.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Navann Ty of BNP Paribas.\nNavann Ty: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One on competition and one on innovation. So on competition, can you expand on, which levers is what is using to defend Apoquel versus Zenrelia? Would that be or is it DTC about the safety, as well as near term pricing or anything else. And for Credelio Quattro, did you plan any promotions around that launch maybe to a lesser extent that when you were facing NexGard Plus. And then on innovation, are you able to discuss progress around the long-acting injectables, monoclonal antibodies and parasiticide and longer term innovation in CKD, oncology and cardiology? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. With regards to competition, and your first question, I think, was on the derm space, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to grow our overall dermatology franchise, whether that's Apoquel, Apoquel, chewable or Cytopoint even with the new competition. We think again, our 11 years of safety and efficacy competing against a product with a box warning. I think is quite strong. I think our satisfaction, we'll continue to do the same tactics we always did. We don't see any need to change any of those. That's really around building deep relationships with our customers, sharing the performance of the product, investing in direct-to-consumer. We don't really see a need given the competition either with them really or also Credelio Quattro. What we continue to see is Wetteny remarked in his opening statement, is that really when new entrants come, it grows the market overall. They invest more in direct-to-consumer advertising, and you'll see more of a conversion over to the oral isoxazoline class. So we remain very confident. We're not planning on changing any of our promotional tactics, when you think about both the entrant and derm, as well as the additional entrant into the paras. Look, we expect everyone will enter paras, and that will only grow the category overall. As you think about innovation, as we talked about at our Investor Day, we really see long-acting across all of our key franchises, an important driver of growth haven't yet given specific guidance on when those launches will be, but those will be more of the near-term launches, as we mentioned in previous sessions.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'd be happy to return the call to Kristin Peck for closing comments.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, and thank you all for joining us. As always, we really appreciate your questions and importantly, your interest in Zoetis. The animal health industries is repeatedly proven, it's resilient, and our work remains essential, not only for animals, but for the people and the communities and the economy is impacted globally. So looking ahead, we are excited to strengthen our market leadership by leveraging this resilience, and driving long-term growth and value creation. And with that, I want to thank you for your continued trust, as you move forward with confidence and purpose, committed to shaping the future of animal health. Thanks for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect, and everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our 2024 third quarter earnings call. Let me start by thanking our dedicated purpose-driven colleagues who helped us deliver another excellent quarter. Building on the strong momentum from the first half of the year, revenue grew 14% operationally and adjusted net income is up 15% operationally. We saw balanced double-digit growth across the business. Driven by steady demand for our key franchises, U.S. grew 15% and international revenue grew 13% operationally. Our innovative companion animal portfolio grew 15% operationally, while livestock grew 11% on an operational basis. Our consistent growth is fueled by a diverse, durable, and science-driven portfolio, carefully crafted through a deep understanding of our customers' evolving needs. By maintaining a strong focus on innovation, we set the standard for improving patient outcomes, higher customer satisfaction, and strong partnerships with veterinarians and pet owners. Our osteoarthritis pain franchise, Librela and Solensia, continues to make a transformative impact by addressing a critical unmet need, delivering 97% operational revenue growth globally. From our conversations with customers around the world, it's clear that our safe effective solutions are making a meaningful difference in patients' lives. We recognize the profound impact of our work, which only strengthens our commitment to developing this market. We have navigated this path before and understand that building a new category of care requires a steady strategic approach. As we lap the U.S. Librela launch, we continue to grow share, even in a market where canine pain visits typically slow down from Q2 to Q3. In fact, Librela is actively disrupting this trend by driving more clinic visits and increasing engagement. With $55 million in U.S. quarterly sales, we see significant opportunity to further expand share and utilization. In just 11 months, we have treated 1 million dogs, compared to an estimated 8 million receiving other treatments, and Librela have already become the fourth largest product in U.S. pet care. This highlights the demand and long-term growth potential, reinforcing our confidence in the franchise's $1 billion trajectory. With record market penetration in the U.S., we're only scratching the surface of broader utilization potential. We estimate that an additional 17 million dogs are suffering from untreated OA. That's because before Librela, NSAIDs were the only option for vets, which many untreated dogs could not tolerate due to pre-existing conditions. Globally, Librela opportunity is equally significant, with OA pain estimated to affect nearly 40% of dogs. And importantly, in the U.S., we see a similar non-linear growth curve to Europe, where revenue grew 18% operationally year-over-year, in year four of launch. Given our results there, we are poised to create and expand this market domestically. Drawing on that experience is key to positioning Librela as the preferred pain treatment by highlighting its safe, effective, and convenient choice for vets. We will leverage our strong partnerships and continue collaborating with veterinarians to expand treatment adoption, shifting away from two decades of reliance on NSAIDs. Results and trends like these reaffirm what we've long understood. The human-animal bond is undeniable. Today's generation of pet owners see their pets as integral members of their family and expects human-quality care. Monoclonal antibodies, increasingly important in human health, are a prime example of how we are bringing that same kind of innovation to animal health with treatments like Librela and Solensia. Our Simparica franchise continues to deliver impressive results as well, growing 27% operationally. While our science-backed innovations have created entirely new categories in animal health, we have also set the standard for competing in established markets. Through close collaboration with customers, we understood that overcoming first-mover advantage requires two differentiations, and long-term loyalty is earned with products that stand out in both safety and efficacy. The success of our Simparica franchise expanded the total parasiticides market and demonstrated that improving patient outcomes is not zero-sum, especially with significant unmet needs. In 2020, we pioneered the U.S. triple-combination parasite market with Simparica Trio, offering comprehensive protection against fleas, ticks, and heartworms in one monthly chewable. Trio is now the number one vet-prescribed parasiticide, with over 13 million dogs treated in just four years, and 86% of pet owners report high satisfaction. Despite increased competition, Trio prescription rates continue to climb as triple-combination products are gaining share, supported by our field force's scale and excellence in driving customer engagement. And our commitment to making our products accessible through the most convenient channels for pet owners has solidified Trio's retail leadership. Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate a dynamic landscape, but perceive two key outcomes. First, consistent with historic trends, the overall addressable market will grow. Second, having more options will accelerate education of vets and pet owners. Increasing awareness of the benefits of broad-spectrum protection will drive conversion to triple-combination treatments. With our significant head start, proven efficacy, and convenience, along with our trusted relationships, we believe Simparica Trio will remain the preferred choice, even as new products enter the market. Similarly, 16% operational revenue growth across our key dermatology franchise demonstrates how disruptive innovation and strategic lifecycle enhancement drive sustained growth. Over a decade ago, we identified a crucial unmet need in veterinary medicine, a solution for canine dermatological itch that balanced safety and efficacy. Itch impacts the well-being of both pets and their owners. It's heartbreaking to see dogs struggling to find relief from persistent discomfort. We were first to address this challenge. Thanks to our relentless focus on innovation and execution, in just a decade, the market grew from $70 million to over $1.5 billion and growing. But we didn't just enter the market, we built it, cultivated it, and continuously evolved it, creating the industry's first $1 billion franchise. As a result, today, Apoquel is the number one prescribed medication in animal health, and the market and our customers have grown alongside us. And when vets wanted other options, we delivered truly differentiated first-line treatments like Cytopoint, the first monoclonal antibody to treat itch, and Apoquel Chew, a convenient chewable that enhances compliance. These therapies are trusted by veterinarians worldwide, bringing relief to over 23 million dogs globally, and we believe they are the best treatment options. And it's not only our product portfolio that sets us apart, it's our customer-focused approach to development. Vets trust our products for their rigorous safety standards and confidence in dosing regimens that allow for chronic uninterrupted use. Our research-driven approach to JAK inhibition selectively ensured that our treatments can be used safely alongside other medications, including vaccines. With over 20 million dogs globally with untreated or undertreated itch, the derm market growth potential is vast. Our proven performance reflects our commitment to expanding access and providing trusted first-line solutions. Similar to our experience in paras, we expect optionality will grow the overall market, a market where Zoetis has two first-line treatments that are known for being safe, effective and trusted. Even with alternatives, satisfied customers are far less likely to switch, and we continue to deliver the solutions they trust and rely on. Innovation, execution and a relentless focus on customer needs are the cornerstones of our key market-leading franchises. Turning to livestock, we recently closed the sale of our Medicated Feed Additive and certain water-soluble product portfolios to Phibro Animal Health. This transaction is a prime example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy, allowing us to focus our investments on areas with the highest-growth potential aligned with our core capabilities. We remain deeply committed to livestock, sharpening our focus on key areas of innovation, including preventatives, antibiotic alternatives and genetics. For example, in September, we announced a strategic partnership with Danone to leverage Zoetis' genetic testing capabilities in promoting sustainable dairy production. This collaboration aims to help dairy producers and Danone's global supply-chain improve animal health and productivity with a focus on animal well-being. This strengthens long-term industry resilience, while also reducing environmental impact. Looking ahead, we anticipate the livestock industry to grow 2% to 4% annually, and we aim to be at the higher end of that range. Innovation will be a key driver of that growth. And to that end, we have updated our guidance to reflect strong performance across our key franchises, along with impact primarily from the MFA divestiture. Wetteny will guide into the details there. With 12% operational revenue growth through the first three quarters, we have outpaced our initial expectations, a testament to our agility in navigating a complex environment. As we look to Q4, we anticipate a return to our previous levels of above-market growth and remain on-track to meet our revised full-year guidance with strong momentum going into 2025. This quarter's results highlight the strength of our diverse, durable portfolio and unwavering commitment to delivering for our customers. Before I close, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to our colleagues. They embody our purpose, support our customers and drive our exceptional performance. Their dedication is what truly makes the difference. With their passion and commitment, we feel positive about our ability to deliver on the four key tenets of our value proposition, to grow revenue faster than the market, to invest in innovation and growth capabilities, to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue, and to return excess capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Wetteny. Thanks Erin. I'll start with overall Librela and move to Wetteny on sort of quarterly cadence, and the 2025 question you had. Look, we are really pleased with the performance globally with Librela with 123% growth, really remain committed to being a $1 billion franchise. And as you look at just the quarterly progression to-date, it's been the most successful launch in our company's history. In the U.S., we have an 85% penetration rate. Globally we're averaging over 90%. In the first 12 months, we've already got 1 million patients on the product, and we believe we've got a significant runway for growth. With only 1 million patients on that and 8 million still on NSAIDs. We think there's a really large addressable market. We can focus on higher compliance. So, we're very optimistic on that. I'll let Wetteny get into the quarterly cadence going forward as well as your 2025 question as well. Sure. For starters, it was a clean quarter across our entire business in the U.S. and abroad. So there's no stocking dynamics or inventory buildups there. But I'll let Wetteny take the more detailed question on MFAs. Sure. Thanks, Brandon. Look, we're really proud of the performance of Trio. It is the number one prescribed parasiticide. It's already been used in over 13 million dogs. I think that the real focus here for us is Simparica growing 27% globally, is really having a phenomenal product. I think it starts with that. I think we were first to market with Trio, which I think has made a big difference. We've also been able to grow that product tremendously, leveraging alternative channels, which today is about 20% of that. But I think what's really underscoring all this, is that the oral flea tick and hardware market is growing 45% year-over-year. And that growth is moving more people into the oral category. And if you look at puppy share, which I think is a really good indicator of where we're going in the future. Trio has a 35% share in puppies. So I think between being a first mover advantage, having a phenomenal product that's got comprehensive coverage, it's convenient. It's a chewable. I think it's a great product. And look, we've partnered very closely with all of our customers, and certainly with our corporates. And I think you're seeing, the customers are really pleased with the product. So, we see strong momentum going into next year. And I'll underscore some of the comments that Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, which is what we've seen continuously as new entrants enter the market, is the expansion of the oral flea tick and hardware market and that is what we're expecting next year into 2025. So Wetteny, do you want to take the second half of the question? Sure. I would say there's not any new sales marching orders. I think it's a lot more of continuing to focus on getting clinics, have more experience across not just severe, but moving into moderate, which we started probably a little while ago. That was a key focus even for us at launch. So, we'll continue to focus on growing the brand there, but I think it's really sticking with the key messages of the safety of the product. The efficacy of the product and really, demonstrating continuously the opportunity to look at the 8 million patients currently on NSAIDs and switching those NSAIDs patients over to Librela, assuming that that's the right product for that pet overall. So, we remain very, very pleased with this launch, and given how pleased we are at the launch, I think we're going to continue down the same tactics that we have. Certainly now that we've got the penetration, it's really focusing on expanding the use out of just not just severe, but obviously in moderate as well as really talking about the opportunity, given the different pets medical needs to switch from NSAIDs. So I'll turn the second part of the question over to Wetteny on building blocks for '25. Sure. Thanks, David. I'll start with your first one. And Wetteny, if I miss anything, please build on it. As we think about pricing, obviously we start with the pricing environment, and the overall inflation environment in any given market where we compete. But the primary thing that we really focus on, is a product-by-product, SKU-by-SKU view of our differentiation and the marketplace overall. I know you referenced that visits were down. We continue to say visits are not a good proxy for how animal health and more particularly how Zoetis does. Really what you're seeing is some of those wellness visits, and a lot of those are products, pickup products, visits. And a lot of that is going over to the alternative channel, which continues to grow very strongly. But if you look at the visits for our particular products around derm or around pain, they're up. And so, I think we really focus on what is the innovation and what is the value that our product provides, to both the vet and the pet owner. And I think that is what really primarily drives our pricing strategy overall. I'll turn the second question on the pricing - the promotional environment to you, Wetteny. Sure. Wetteny, do you want to take this? Yes. And Balaji, I would just encourage you to look at our slides from today, because we show you some of the graphs of what that actually looks like. And I think with a double-digit growth the fourth year on the market, I think it speaks for itself as well. Sure. I'll start with your second question. Retail grew 34%. I think it's a little bit over. I mean, Wetteny, you can correct me, around 10% of the U.S. business at this point? What is it a little higher? Yes. No, I think it's growing very strongly in the U.S. I mean, look, as we look at overall pricing, again, I'd go back to where I started before, which is look product-by-product and the innovation we're bringing. And I think what we've really talked about continuously is the diverse, durable and innovative portfolio that Zoetis has across species and globally. And so that's how we price our products. And we've continued, as we've seen competition, for example in parasiticides, been continuously taking price there as well where we see the convenience and the benefits that Simparica Trio offer. So, I don't have anything new to add here. I'm not sure Wetteny, if you do. Sure. I'll start with Apoquel and then Wetteny, if you want to build on Librela uptake question. Yes, I mean another strong quarter, obviously, from Apoquel had 16% growth across the quarter. I think it's the number one product out there. It's got 11 years of safety, huge satisfaction rates across both consumers and veterinarians, with a 90% satisfaction rate. And I think our focus with the product, is continuing to grow the category. We think there's an opportunity for higher compliance, to address under or untreated dogs, to convert to 3 million dogs or on other treatments and 8 million dogs currently not on therapy. We're very confident in our ability to compete with this product given the satisfaction, given the safety and given the efficacy overall. We're very proud of the performance of this, and we look forward to strong performance obviously going forward in 2025 and beyond. You want to take - the update? Sure. With regards to competition, and your first question, I think, was on the derm space, we remain very confident in our ability to continue to grow our overall dermatology franchise, whether that's Apoquel, Apoquel, chewable or Cytopoint even with the new competition. We think again, our 11 years of safety and efficacy competing against a product with a box warning. I think is quite strong. I think our satisfaction, we'll continue to do the same tactics we always did. We don't see any need to change any of those. That's really around building deep relationships with our customers, sharing the performance of the product, investing in direct-to-consumer. We don't really see a need given the competition either with them really or also Credelio Quattro. What we continue to see is Wetteny remarked in his opening statement, is that really when new entrants come, it grows the market overall. They invest more in direct-to-consumer advertising, and you'll see more of a conversion over to the oral isoxazoline class. So we remain very confident. We're not planning on changing any of our promotional tactics, when you think about both the entrant and derm, as well as the additional entrant into the paras. Look, we expect everyone will enter paras, and that will only grow the category overall. As you think about innovation, as we talked about at our Investor Day, we really see long-acting across all of our key franchises, an important driver of growth haven't yet given specific guidance on when those launches will be, but those will be more of the near-term launches, as we mentioned in previous sessions. Thanks, and thank you all for joining us. As always, we really appreciate your questions and importantly, your interest in Zoetis. The animal health industries is repeatedly proven, it's resilient, and our work remains essential, not only for animals, but for the people and the communities and the economy is impacted globally. So looking ahead, we are excited to strengthen our market leadership by leveraging this resilience, and driving long-term growth and value creation. And with that, I want to thank you for your continued trust, as you move forward with confidence and purpose, committed to shaping the future of animal health. Thanks for joining us."

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. To reiterate, innovation and execution underpinned an excellent third quarter, driven by the strength of our diverse and differentiated portfolio. Another quarter of double-digit operational growth across species and geographies. The remarkable performance of our companion animal portfolio highlights the willingness of pet owners to spend on the health and well-being of their pets and the value of our products to pet owners and veterinary practices. Our livestock growth underscores the essential and growing need for animal protein around the world, and the important role our products play in helping producers keep their herds healthy. Put simply, we provide critical solutions central to animal health. Our success is directly tied to our customers, and our first-to-market innovations continue to fuel the growth and success of their practices. In the third quarter, we posted $2.4 billion in revenue, growing 11% on a reported basis and 14% operationally, with 8% driven by volume and 6% from price. Adjusted net income of $716 million grew 14% on a reported basis and 15% operationally. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, OP pain mAbs contributed $151 million. Our Simparica franchise posted $333 million, and our key dermatology franchise contributed revenue of $449 million. Our lifestyle portfolio also contributed strong growth with $758 million in revenue. Regarding our OP pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia, in Europe, after just 3.5 years on the market, Librela and Solensia are the leading treatments for OA pain and are driving market expansion by broadening treatment options across cases. As Kristin mentioned, many of these patients were previously untreated because they could not tolerate NSAIDs. In Europe and the U.S., Librela expansion into this patient group represents a significant market growth opportunity. In the U.S., the growing importance of mAbs cannot be understated. While overall U.S. clinic visits are down, particularly for prescription-only visits that are moving to alternative channels, therapeutic visits such as those for OA are on the rise. In the U.S., Librela has brought almost 0.5 million new patients to the OA pain category since launch by expanding the market with a new standard-of-care. Our performance within the Simparica franchise highlights our ability to meet the evolving needs of pet owners by delivering safe, effective products to convenient channels such as retail, where Trio is the top-selling pharmaceutical. Parasiticides is the largest, most competitive therapeutic category in animal health, and we have substantially increased our market share by being the first-to-market in the U.S. with a trusted differentiated product. Since the launch of Trio, we have gone from number five in this category to number two with clear triple combination market leadership. And in the first year of competition in U.S. triple combinations, we grew revenue by more than 25% and increased our market share. In the U.S., we estimate almost 60% of medicalized dogs are not on triple combination products. The increased share of voice for new entrants should accelerate the shift to triple combinations, where we have a first-to-market advantage. We continue to win with puppies, where Trio is the preferred choice for these new patients, signaling strong growth potential. Earlier, Kristin highlighted the deliberate balance between safety and efficacy with our key dermatology products. Apoquel delivered on that and quickly became one of the most important products in clinics. We understood our customers wanted more convenient options for derm treatment, and we delivered. We have multiple derm products with unique value propositions for both the vet and the pet owner. All of our products can be used on acute, seasonal and chronic cases and have years of real-world vet and pet owner satisfaction. As we face new competition, we remain confident in our growth trajectory. We have proven experience defending established brands and we are confident that our portfolio of first-line treatments remain among the most important products in vet clinics. Now let's move to segment results. U.S. revenue grew 15% in the quarter with companion animal growing 18% and livestock growing 5%. U.S. companion animal performance was driven by our OA pain mAbs, including the launch of Librela, as well as continued adoption and compliance of Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise. We continue to grow above-market, driven by increased therapeutic treatment for OA and dermatology, veterinarian's preference for injectables and evolving pet owner preference for retail convenience and home delivery, which also boosts compliance with oral medications. Our OA pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia, posted a combined $73 million in U.S. sales in Q3. Librela generated $55 million, primarily on increased clinic utilization. Penetration has reached 85%, faster than any product in our history. A crucial first step-in our successful launch was ensuring clinic availability. And again, we are just scratching the surface with OA. Just as we've seen with our key dermatology franchise, addressing unmet needs with revolutionary treatment can deliver long-term growth, and we believe Librela will be a growth tailwind for years ahead. Solensia posted $18 million in revenue, or 50% growth. While the incidence rate for OA in cats is similar to dogs at around 40%, there were very few treatment options for cats prior to Solensia. Since Solensia's launch in the U.S. two years ago, we have seen feline OA patients increase over 70%. With current feline medicalization rates significantly lower than dogs, boosting feline treatment presents a significant untapped opportunity. Simparica Trio posted U.S. growth of 29%, with $237 million in revenue. We previously highlighted Trio's momentum through the first year with competition, and our expectations remain high. As we have seen with previous generations of parasiticides, secondary entrants serve to accelerate conversion from older therapies. But in the absence of meaningful differentiation, they do not erode market share. In addition to robust volume growth for Trio, we continue to see the benefit of price driven by our lower promotional environment, and more thoughtful discounting across our customer base. In U.S. key dermatology, we saw 17% growth, or $303 million, for the quarter. Apoquel was the largest driver with outsized contributions from the retail channel. Apoquel Chewable growth outpaced tablet cannibalization declines, benefiting from increased conversion and compliance. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by preference for injectables. U.S. livestock grew 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by volume growth in cattle, where we continue to see improved supply of [indiscernible]. This growth was partially offset by Draxxin price declines. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 7% on a reported basis and 13% operationally in the quarter. International livestock grew 15% operationally and companion animal grew 11% operationally. International livestock grew 15% operationally in the quarter with equal contributions from volume and price. Cattle was the largest growth contributor, driven by the impact of price in high inflationary markets, as well as volume growth from higher demand and improved supply. Poultry growth was driven by price and key account penetration. Lastly, fish saw strong volume growth in Norway, driven by high demand for our vaccines, as well as the impact of a soft comparable period last year. International companion animal growth was driven by our Simparica key dermatology and OA pain mAbs franchises. Our international Simparica franchise grew 28% operationally, with $75 million in sales. Performance was driven by Simparica Trio, growing 39% operationally to $31 million in sales, benefiting from key account growth in Europe, DTC and the positive impact of our Q1 China launch. Simparica grew 22% operationally on $44 million in sales, driven primarily by Eastern Europe and Brazil. Our international key dermatology franchise contributed $146 million of revenue and 13% operational growth, with double-digit operational growth in Apoquel and Cytopoint. Growth was driven by Apoquel with strong DTC success, especially in European markets. Europe is also benefiting from strong adoption of Apoquel Chewable, where we now see more than half of doses dispensed coming from the chewable formulation. Our key dermatology franchise continues to expand internationally. Many countries are still in the early stages of derm market development and increases in medicalization as well as the benefits that chewable and injectables can offer, provide a significant run rate for growth. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 27% operationally, posting $78 million in combined revenue. International sales of Librela were $62 million, growing 26% operationally. The growth of Librela was driven by higher use in Europe, as well as market expansion and share gains in second-wave launch markets. We see opportunity for continued market expansion from converting existing NSAID patients and increasing months on therapy. Solensia sales were $16 million, growing 32% on an operational basis. Now moving on to the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin of 70.7% grew 20 basis points with increases from price and mix, offset by higher manufacturing costs. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally. Growth was driven primarily by SG&A expenses of 9% operationally, largely due to higher compensation-related expenses due to company performance. R&D grew 10% operationally in the quarter on higher compensation-related expenses due to company performance and increases in project spend related to internal portfolio advancements. Adjusted net income grew faster than revenue at 15% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. Now moving on to guidance for the full year 2024. Our raised revenue guidance reflects continued strong performance of our key franchises, partially offset by a reduction to sales for the divestiture of our Medicated Feed Additive product portfolio and certain water soluble products completed October 31. As Kristin highlighted, we remain committed to livestock and see opportunities in several therapeutic areas, enhanced by our strategic partnerships and focus. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of mid-October. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.2 billion and $9.3 billion, a range of 10% to 11% operational growth. This is both an increase and a narrowing of our revenue range versus our prior full year guidance. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.67 billion to $2.695 billion, representing operational growth of 13.5% to 14.5%. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.86 to $5.92 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.33 to $5.39. We have seen outstanding performance in 2024 thus far with broad-based growth from our key innovative products across species and geographies, and we remain very positive on the remainder of the year and beyond. Our guidance, combined with our year-to-date results, does signal some expected deceleration in our revenue growth rate for Q4 specifically. As a reminder, revenue growth in Q4 will be impacted by the MFA divestiture, reflecting a reduction of two months of U.S. sales and one month from our international business out of our results in Q4. Additionally, we also saw the impact of stocking from the launch of both Librela and Apoquel Chewable in Q4 of last year. Normalizing for these items, Q4 will be more in line with our historical growth rate. We remain confident in underlying demand and market dynamics as we move into the fourth quarter and then 2025. Our outlook for next year remains positive. We continue to see favorable trends in our key franchises, including OA, dermatology and Simparica, as well as momentum from alternative channels. While we anticipate the recent tailwinds from higher inflation to normalize, our recent performance has significantly outpaced price-driven gains alone. Additionally, we expect headwinds in China to normalize in Q4 and moving into next year. We estimate these headwinds have had approximately 1 percentage unfavorable impact to our growth this year that should normalize in 2025. We are confident in our continued ability to grow above the animal health market, driven by the strength of our portfolio, pipeline and our dedicated colleagues. Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Yes, Erin, as Kristin said, Librela has been our most successful launch in the history of the company by every metric that we look at in penetration and also the first 12 months revenue and approximately $192 million. Now as we don't tend to give guidance down to an individual product for an individual quarter. But what I would say in terms of the cadence of Librela, is that we'll continue to see and exiting this year into next year. We expect to see strong growth given our penetration. As Kristin said, about $1 million being treated, compared to NSAIDs that are at about 8 million. And so we know launching these major franchises, standards of care, take time. And one other item that is certainly clear, when you look at the historical visits around OA Pain, as Kristin said in the prepared commentary. We do tend to see a peak in Q2 coming down in Q3, and then typically comes back up a bit in Q4, but not to the level of Q2. So that's another element that I would give you to sort of consider as you think about, what to expect through the end of the year, and going into 2025. Now with respect to your second part of your question around considerations and profitability, et cetera. We continue to demonstrate an ability to grow above the animal health market. We certainly see that in our performance this year, on a year-to-date basis we're at 12%. We just raised guidance again for the third time this year, clearly well above the market, and are growing our just an income faster than our top line, including in this quarter, which as you recall last call. We highlighted the fact that we are increasing some of our investments, as we exit this year. And we still delivered faster adjusted income. And so as we look ahead, this is a core tenet of our value proposition that we'll continue to be mindful of, and we have the opportunity here as we look ahead to leverage investments we've made in the past, including field force investments in the U.S. And we see opportunity to continue to leverage those even as we continue to drive growth and launch products, across the market. We will continue to see some investments in DTC behind our key brands. Again, we're building a market, something we have demonstrated an ability to build the markets, expand them and defend them. If you look at what we're doing across our portfolio, right now. And an important part of that will be DTC and advertising promotion behind these products as we go into next year. We would anticipate again, as I've said before, the business has an inherent ability to grow the bottom line faster than the top. As you see the mix as well as price that we're able to take. How much we deliver in any given year may vary depending on the levels of investments we're making, but we may committed to growing the bottom line faster. Yes, sure. Look to Kristin's point, if you look at inventory levels, particularly across distributors in the U.S., which we have visibility into, not as much visibility obviously across clinics individually. But our inventory levels remain closer to the low end of our historical averages, similar to where we were over a year ago in Q1, after the destocking. So I would say that. And then within Librela, keep in mind, this is a whole chain product that, is being shipped direct to clinics and not going through distribution. So it's really a product. And given our penetration levels that we highlighted two quarters ago, there's not incremental penetration to really influence inventory levels here. So I thought I would add that, to the answer you already received. With MFAs, just a reminder of what we have disclosed previously. This is a business last year 2023, full year did about $400 million at about 30% margin. So I think that gives you and by the way, seasonality here is roughly linear across the year. So if you look at the divestiture this year, it's about half of a quarter, with two months of the U.S. and one month of international. You can run the numbers here in terms of what the impact, is exiting this year. And then, what that would be for next year, because we'd have three and a half quarters in the number in 2024 that, we'll be comping against. And I think that should give you. Even though I'm not getting into specifics on SG&A versus R&D, et cetera, I think that gives you an impact on through the P&L. Sure. In terms of price mix and volume here? As you heard in prepared commentary, the 14% operational growth in the quarter was 8% volume and 6% price. Now your question, if it's related specifically to our parasiticides in the Trio performance, I would say it's about balance, with slightly more volume than price. Here and keep in mind as we've stated previously, we have more targeted promotions as well as discounts to our customers. Which is actually driving better price realization, and not just price increases if you will here on this product, which again has been a phenomenal execution I would say, and contribution to the growth that you're seeing on Trio specifically. Sure Jon. Look, we look forward to sharing our 2025 guidance on our next call in February, and just maybe a few reminders here that might be helpful in terms of directionally where we're headed, right. We have several sources of growth and we continue to see strong underlying demand, across our portfolio in most markets where we operate. Our outlook for derm and for Trio remain very positive, exiting this year and going into next year. We expect to see continued strong growth, across our OA pain franchise on a year-over-year basis. And even if you have more normalized pricing, we would expect those to be above, slightly above our historical pricing contribution of 2% to 3%. And as I covered in the prepared commentary, China will be more normalized as we exit this year starting in Q4, and into the next year. And so, you have less of a headwind going into next year, which was almost a full point in the current year. The last piece I would give is just reminder on the MFA and water soluble product portfolio. Removing those and I shared those numbers already in terms of what - those products did last year. So hopefully that's helpful, in terms of getting you into some sort of ballpark here. Sure. Look, the only thing I would add to the visits, is even as overall visits are down in the U.S. If you look at the key therapeutic areas for us, OA Pain business up double-digits. Derm visits are up even as more and more of our Apoquel products, are being sold through the retail channel. So I think that really spells it and consistent with what we've been sharing for some time now. And then if you look at alternative channels, it has been a significant growth driver for us across the U.S. pet care, which, of course, reduces some of the dependency on clearing visits, as well as the auto-ship and higher compliance that, that drives. Alternative channels were up actually 34% year-on-year on the quarter, again, demonstrating that point. As far as promotional activities, my comment here is you see far more disciplined promotional environment this year, particularly when you compare it to last year, when we were up against a new competitor in the civil combination parasiticide space. So that comment really is to say, there's not as much promotional activity here, and that we are more targeted in terms of our discounting to our customers. Sure. The first point in terms of next year, and again, I look forward to providing more specific guidance in February here. Balaji, look, I think as we've said at Investor Day, we see opportunity to leverage our SG&A from an OpEx perspective. We have been running R&D driven by our portfolio, and our pipeline progression faster than revenue. I think you see that coming in closer to revenue this year. We'll get into more detail in that in terms of what we would expect into next year, but that's certainly one consideration. I think when I think about other pushes and pulls, there's been a lot of conversations around Argentina this year. I think one thing to keep in mind is, as we have highlighted, the pricing that we have taken in Argentina this year you get in other hyperinflationary markets for that matter. Again, if you expect a more normalized pricing environment, and we would anticipate slightly above where our historical rate is, that incremental price you see from Argentina this year, which is actually on a declining basis. So Q1 was the peak we've come down in Q2 and in Q3, and we expect Q4 to be closer to 1%. I think that would be an item to consider as we go through next year. But one important point though is if you work down the P&L that, has actually had significant headwinds through inflation, through the middle of the P&L. And then from an FX perspective, if you look at the reported results, the net impact of Argentina year-over-year, is actually negative across the P&L. So I think that's really important points to keep in mind, as you're thinking about SG&A? And then the other point on - as we look at the parasiticide market, and what we expect to happen here, we've seen this before. This is the same that we saw, say, almost a decade ago with the launch of all isoxazolines, you saw really continual transition into those that continue to grow the market substantially. And clearly, when we look at the percentage of puppies that are getting put on a triple combination, which is much higher than the overall percentage of dogs that are on paras. So about a third of the prescription parasiticides are in triple combinations, but over 50% of puppies are. And so that gives you a strong indication, of what's going to continue to happen in that market. The split between how much is going from other orals versus collars and topic is not something we have a specificity on, but needless to say, that is where the market is going is towards those triple combinations. It's closer to 15%. If you look at all alternative channels, that's retail online as well as brick and mortar and home, home delivery as well combined. Look, I think if you look at this year, right, we are taking price. If you take Argentina out, it's somewhere in the 4.5% to 5% range across the rest of our portfolio, right? And despite that, you see significant volume growth. This quarter, I think, is a testament to that 8% volume growth and 6% price. And so, if you look at our key product areas, actually derm you see price as well as substantial volume growth. So we think there's room for us to continue that, given the value that we bring with these innovations. Yes, sure. Look, I think as we've said before, this is our most successful launch cover in the company's history. And I think while it's a little bit early, to get into a ton of detail around compliance in the U.S. specifically. I always like to look at our international markets, which will continue to see strong double-digit growth across those markets for years out. And when we look at the transition into more moderate cases, which now represent more than 60% of our - of cases in - across Europe, for example, that's driving up much on therapy, to be above seven months. And compliance rates that are exceptionally high in that market. So I think this gives you an indication of where the market is, and given the efficacy and the revolutionary profile of this product, what it can do and what is actually doing across markets outside the U.S., and we're very pleased with where we are in the launch trajectory here in the U.S. as well. Sure. I'll give that a shot. Look, I think if you look at our history over a decade, we have outperformed the market by three points on average. I would argue, if you look at the market growth rates this year, it's even above that. Now your question is how - what's our confidence level and be able to sustain that. We're very confident in our ability to sustain that given our existing portfolio. And bifurcating between existing portfolio and new launches is not something I'm going to venture into, because that is ingrained into how we go to market, and how we continue to invest in solving for our customers' greatest challenges. It's hard for me to give you what the growth rate would be without that. But what I would say is it's really important to note that it's not only when we launch, a brand new innovation in a new area. Is a continued life cycle innovation that we drive, which is almost historically 50% of our R&D spend. So we continue to grow the market and expand the market, adding additional claims as we go along the way, which is how we, over time, build markets. And I know there's a lot of questions around sequential growth, et cetera, it's not really about the sequential growth. It's never really super linear it's over time, building the market that once you build it, it's also very sticky, because you've established the standard and someone else has to come with something that is significantly differentiated in order to overtake you. And that's what drives our business. So, we're very confident in continuing to be able to outperform the industry."

Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call for 2024, we had another outstanding quarter, growing revenue 11% operationally and 18% operational growth in adjusted net income. Success was fueled by strong demand for innovative products, our ability to capture and expand markets and the dedication of our purpose driven colleagues. Segment growth was well-balanced with 12% growth in the US and 10% operational revenue growth internationally even against a strong comparative quarter. Our innovative companion animal portfolio grew 12% operationally, while our livestock portfolio saw 9% operational growth across species and geographies. It's been an excellent first half of 2024, growing revenue 12% operationally, highlighting that our leadership stems from both industry-leading innovation and differentiated execution. We remain focused on our core strategy, delivering consistent results for our customers, the animals and their care and our shareholders and our unwavering commitment to excellence, has resulted in the most diverse and comprehensive animal health portfolio. We lead the industry in R&D investment, bringing over 300 science-driven innovations to market, including three of the top five best-selling products in Animal Health, Apoquel, Simparica Trio and Cytopoint. With our global footprint and world-class manufacturing facilities, we ensure consistent quality and on-time delivery. Our early investments in digital transformation, power and exceptional customer experience, while positioning us for future growth. We continuously refine our commercial strategies and for effective launches and market penetration. And our powerful brand recognition, targeted direct-to-consumer campaigns experienced sales reps and medical experts help us capture new market share and win loyalty. Our customers are at the center of everything we do from understanding their challenges to exceeding their expectations. Scientific innovation enables us to meet their demands while creating new markets, our commercial execution allows us to defend and grow that market leadership. The animal health industry has proven essential and resilient in all types of climates, but it is also dynamic and growing, and we are well-positioned to seize the opportunity. Look no further than our revolutionary osteoarthritis pain franchise, Librela for dogs and Solensia for cats. We are developing a market with breakthrough products that are safer and more effective, while offering convenience for veterinarians and pet owners. The results speak for themselves. Globally, Librela grew 142% operationally this quarter, fueled by the successful and ongoing US launch. But again, its innovation coupled with execution. Take Solensia, for example. Despite launching in Europe three years ago, we reported 60% operational growth this quarter. Our break-throughs are driving increased feline clinic visits, which in turn expands the total market. We along with veterinarians and pet owners are excited about how these safe and efficacious products are revolutionizing first-line treatment for chronic pain in dogs and cats of all ages. Given our proven track-record of building and scaling billion-dollar franchises, we remain confident about the OA pain trajectory, but we don't just launch products, we cultivate them for long-term success. Our key dermatology franchise exemplifies this commitment, delivering strong 18% operational growth driven by Apoquel and Apoquel chewable along with Cytopoint. We have transformed the management of atopic dermatitis in dogs, providing safe, effective and convenient solutions with over 23 million dogs treated globally and a decade of proven results Apoquel is the world's Number #1 prescribed oral medication for allergic itch and it is overwhelmingly endorsed by veterinarians worldwide with approximately 90% satisfaction, reflecting the trust and confidence they place in our market-leading brands. And we are still unlocking the opportunity. Today, there are approximately 20 million dogs globally with undertreated or untreated pruritic itch presenting a vast untapped market. Take the US, for example, we estimate that 10 million dogs are currently receiving veterinary treatment for itch. While the majority or roughly 70% received Apoquel or Cytopoint, there are 3 million dogs prescribed alternative options like steroids. Moreover, an estimated 8 million dogs are treated with over-the-counter products or not treated at all. This highlights the potential addressable market of 11 million dogs in the US, alone that could benefit from our safe and effective therapies. Internationally, the trend is similar with room for even more growth as dogs become increasingly medicalized, underscoring a significant global market opportunity that will fuel our ongoing growth. To solidify our leadership and win new patients, we are focused on DTC marketing to raise awareness, enhance medical education to improve compliance and expanding retail partnerships. Our ability to execute extends to the Simparica franchise, which grew 22% operationally for the quarter. We have not only navigated the changing competitive landscape, but embrace new opportunities with confidence and agility. Several pre trends are fueling our growth. First, pet owner demographics are shifting. They are younger, more affluent and connected by the powerful human animal bond. They are highly engaged and willing to invest in their pet health and well-being. Second, and Wetteny will say more on this. There is a significant channel shift aimed at meeting the evolving needs of these younger pet owners. We are making our products more accessible, ensuring they are available where and when they need them. This combination is a crucial part of our growth strategy, and the results are reflected in our performance. In this dynamic environment, our execution across all phases from launch to expansion to defense, set us apart, showcasing we can introduce, sustain and grow products in a competitive market. Our focus on innovation and execution cuts across every part of the business to create shareholder value. In our livestock portfolio, the sale of our medicated feed additive and certain water-soluble product portfolios remains on track to close in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, we are focusing on innovative solutions for producers, including preventative, antibiotic alternatives and genetics. As the demand for healthy and sustainable animal protein continues to rise, we remain committed to supporting our livestock customers. Our dedication to meeting their needs and adapted to the evolving market conditions ensures that we are well positioned to contribute to their success. Building on our outstanding performance this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to grow faster than the market and through competition as reflected in our raised guidance. While macroeconomic headwinds persist, Animal Health remains resilient and Zoetis' strong operational execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio enable us to navigate all kinds of market conditions effectively. We further demonstrated our commitment to shareholders and confidence in our growth trajectory with the recent announcement of a Board-approved $6 billion share repurchase program, which Wetteny will elaborate on. The animal health landscape is evolving, and our innovations are at the forefront. And while breakthrough innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy, our success is rooted in multiple drivers of growth. We are not just launching new products, we are transforming existing ones to unlock their full potential and better serve customer needs through life cycle innovations. That means taking proven therapies and developing new formulations, uses and delivery methods maximizing their impact and reach. This translates to value created for customers and shareholders alike by allowing us to bring critical new solutions to market faster minimizing development risk and costs by leveraging existing safety profiles of proven products and expanding the reach of established products. Our commitment to life cycle innovation is just one reason we are the leader in animal health. When combined with our market leadership, deep customer insights, strategic investments and our purpose driven colleagues, we are uniquely positioned to deliver against the four tenets of our value proposition. To grow revenues faster than the market, to invest in innovation and growth capabilities to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue and to return excess capital to shareholders. Our differentiated execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio ensures we are not just keeping pace, we are setting the pace and redefining what's possible in animal health. With that, let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny?\nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, Kristin, and good morning everyone. As you heard Kristin mention, our ability to execute on our commercial and strategic plans drove another outstanding quarter. We simultaneously executed across product launches, market expansion and market defense to propel us to a strong first-half. In the second quarter, we posted $2.4 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Adjusted net income of $711 million grew 9% on a reported basis and 18% operationally. Quarterly growth was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, OA pain mAbs posted $149 million. Our Simparica franchise posted revenue of $384 million, which includes $299 million from Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise contributed $414 million. Our lifestyle portfolio also saw strong growth with $694 million in revenue. Looking closely at our success and execution. I'd like to focus first on OA pain. As we continue to execute our US launch strategy, we remain confident in our OA pain trajectory. Based on our experience launching other billion-dollar franchises, we know that first-in-class therapies require significantly more market development than lagging look-alikes. In the US, we have reached over 9,000 vets and veterinary technicians through interactive information sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and industry KOLs. This is on top of the thousands of interactions our sales reps and medical teams have had on individual vet visits. These interactions ensure our customers have the tools and resources to reinforce the safety and efficacy of Librela and Solensia with pet owners. Additionally, we are deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. Pet owners know their pets better than anyone, and we want to help them detect the signs of OA and the available treatment options. We know these therapies are improving lives based on the positive testimonials from pet owners. The positive impact and reception of Librela are reflected in the market adoption. In the US, we see record penetration with over 80% of clinics now purchasing the product. No product in our history has penetrated this quickly. Reorder rates are approaching 90%, which is a leading indicator of customer satisfaction. In Europe, shipment is expanding to moderate and mild OA cases that were largely untreated, now making up more than 65% of total cases. This is just a glimpse into what we expect in the US over time, as Librela continues to expand the addressable market and gain market share. Despite our early success, we still have significant room for continued expansion. Our focus on execution doesn't stop after we launch a product. After more than a decade of exceptional safety and efficacy, our key dermatology franchise is still a critical performance driver, growing 18% operationally in the quarter. In the US, derm clinic visits are increasing, driving volume growth across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. The franchise including Apoquel, Apoquel chewable and Cytopoint is designed to cover multiple needs across different dermatological indications and their different methods of administration suit any vet or pet owner preference. Our derm products also address a full spectrum of pruritic cases, providing relief from acute and seasonal conditions, as well as treatment for dogs, with lifelong chronic conditions, which make up the majority of total derm revenue. And vets and pet owners are extremely happy with the results. In global studies, veterinarians report approximately 90% of that satisfaction with Apoquel safety and efficacy. Our comprehensive portfolio meets vets\u2019 needs and the needs of their patients, and we are confident in our ability to grow revenue even in the face of competition. That confidence is fueled by the significant opportunities for market expansion that Kristin mentioned earlier. First, we are targeting the 8 million dogs in the US with atopic dermatitis that are either untreated or not treated by a vet through direct-to-consumer advertising, helping to educate pet owners on the signs of an itchy dog and our prescription treatment options. Additionally, in the US, there are 3 million dogs who are prescribed alternative products like steroids. We are confident in our ability to win these new customers through our proven safety and efficacy. We are also drawing more doses from the same patient base due to trends within pet health care, including [preference for] (ph) injectable therapies, chewable formulations and alternative channel growth, increasing compliance. Lastly, there are many markets where our key dermatology franchise is in the early stages of maturity. These markets should provide long-term growth trajectory and our outstanding international growth highlights this momentum. Our excellence in execution on our OA pain launches and key dermatology expansion has contributed to a great first half of the year. Now let us move on to our segment results. US revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with companion animal growing 13% and livestock posting 11% growth. For the first time, sales across our US companion animal portfolio surpassed $1 billion in the quarter. Performance was driven by our OA pain mAbs, Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise. Portfolio growth was largely driven by trends in retail and home delivery, reflecting the evolution of pet-owner preference for convenience and increased compliance on dispensing oral medications. In the clinic, usage of injectable therapeutic treatment is going to offset the alternative channel shift. Our pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $71 million in US sales in Q2. Librela generated $53 million, primarily on increased clinic utilization. As I mentioned to-date, market adoption is higher than any product in our history. Thus, we are confident in our trajectory. Solensia posted $18 million in revenue. We continue to be pleased with what we are seeing in the feline OA space. As Kristin mentioned, we see positive trends in feline OA visits which have nearly doubled since our launch almost two years ago. Simparica Trio posted US growth of 19% in the quarter on $254 million in revenue. We are entering our second year with competition in the triple combination parasiticide market, and we continue to execute on not just defending our leadership position with Trio, but growing it. Again we do not take a launch and done mentality. We posted 26% moving average total growth over the past 12 months. The majority of which was in a competitive market, highlighting not only our first mover advantage, but also the stickiness of our customer base. Lastly, in the vet channel, Simparica Trio is winning with Puppies, a leading indicator of future performance. In the absence of meaningful differentiation, vets and pet owners are reluctant to switch from a safe, efficacious product. The dermatology product sales in the US were $283 million for the quarter growing 17%. Apoquel was the largest growth driver with Apoquel chewable benefiting from increased conversion. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable solutions, especially for chronic cases. Earlier, Kristin alluded to shifting pet owner demographics in the evolving landscape. Much of our success with Simparica Trio and Apoquel has been bolstered by our ability to win in the growing retail and home delivery space. The convenience of these channels for self-administered products are increasingly popular with pet owners, and we are committed to making our products available where our customers need them. Currently, Simparica Trio is the best-selling prescription products in the retail channel and Apoquel is second. We estimate that over 20% of Trio sales and one-third of Apoquel sales now come via the retail channel. Additionally, the alternative channel growth rate for both Trio and Apoquel exceeded overall growth rate for these products this quarter. Growing pet owner preference for alternative channel convenience, has led to a decline in product-only clinic visits. This is why visits are not the best indicator of our performance, given we have consistently grown volume in an evolving landscape. Our US companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 5% in the quarter, [returning to growth] (ph) after Q1 distributor inventory work downs following our channel strategies change. US Livestock had a strong quarter, growing 11% driven primarily from the timing of supply on ceftiofur, which had a soft comparable period last year. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 12% operationally and Livestock grew 8% operationally. Our international companion animal portfolio growth was driven by our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises, partially offset by impact in China. Our international Simparica franchise grew 35% operationally. Growth was driven by Simparica, growing 38% operationally to $59 million in sales in the quarter. We continue to see increased use in Latin America and Eastern Europe, as well as price benefits in high inflationary markets. Simparica Trio grew 31% operationally on $45 million in sales benefiting from key account growth in Europe, continued focus on DTC and the positive impact of our recent launch in China. Our key dermatology franchise grew 19% operationally in the quarter posting $131 million in sales. We saw double digit growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was partially offset by headwinds in Japan due to pre-price buy-ins in Q1. As we highlighted earlier, we continue to see significant opportunity for growth. Many international markets are in the early stages of market development with significant runway for growth. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 35% operationally, posting $79 million in combined revenue. International Librela sales were $63 million growing 32% operationally. As we highlighted last quarter, we have lapped the launches in our last significant international markets, which occurred in Q2 of 2023. Solensia sales were $16 million, growing 49% operationally. Our international companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 15% operationally with strong performance across much of Asia and Europe. International companion animal growth was partially offset by expected declines in China, driven by Revolution franchise. International livestock grew 8% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases, primarily in cattle and poultry in high inflationary markets. We saw strong growth in our fish portfolio this quarter with contributions from price and volume driven by strong demand for vaccines in Norway. Growth in price and fish was partially offset by volume declines in most of our other livestock species, due to a challenging comparable quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable rotations. As expected the economic challenges in China persist, putting pressure on certain companion animal products, as well as livestock, especially in swine. Consistent with what we have said for several quarters, the impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but continued headwinds are expected throughout the year across companion animal and livestock. [Physical] (ph) discipline across the P&L is one of the things that unlocks successful execution. As we move on to some of the highlights, we wanted to reaffirm our continued commitment to reinvesting in our business and our confidence in the returns we see from those investments. Adjusted gross margins of 71.7% declined 70 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 130 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases favorable mix and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in high inflationary markets. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally contributing to this growth was SG&A increases of 7% operationally and 17% operational growth in R&D. Improvements in operational gross margin and prudent expense growth contributed to adjusted net income which grew 18% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 20% operationally for the quarter. Lastly, I want to highlight our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we repurchased a record high $533 million in shares. Additionally, on August 1, we announced that we received board approval for a new $6 billion share repurchase program, our largest program to-date. The shares are expected to be repurchased over a multiyear period of up to four years, and the program can be canceled at any time. The company's previous $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in December 2021 is expected to be completed this year. This commitment reflects continued confidence in our ability to return value to shareholders. Before moving to guidance, an update on the planned divestiture of our Medicated Feed Additives portfolio. As Kristin mentioned, we are expecting this divestiture to close some time in the second half. Our current guidance is not reflective of the sale and may be adjusted subsequent to the close of the deal. As we stated in our April announcement, this portfolio generated approximately $400 million in revenue in 2023 with roughly linear seasonality. Now moving on to guidance for full year 2024. Our outstanding first half performance particularly in our Simparica and key dermatology franchises, demonstrated our ability to drive growth through execution across our business and gives us confidence going forward. Thus, we are raising our 2024 guidance provided during May's earnings call. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates of late July. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.25 billion, a range of 9% to 11% operational growth. As we stated earlier, our OA pain trajectory remains on track. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.64 billion to $2.69 billion, representing operational growth of 13.5% to 15.5%. We are maintaining our commitment to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long-term, while increasing our investment in demand generating activities such as direct-to-consumer advertising. While we saw exceptional leverage this quarter, subsequent quarters may have -- may not have the same level of operating leverage, due to the optimal timing of investments. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.78 to $5.88 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. In closing before we go to Q&A, the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our relationships, as well as our ability to execute on our strategic vision, continually allows us to outperform our peers. We have the utmost confidence in our best-in-class portfolio and colleagues to continue to set the benchmark moving forward. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Great. Thanks guys. And good morning. Wetteny, maybe the first one for you. Was there a split between price and volume for the quarter? Sorry if I missed that. And then how do we think about pricing contribution from here will call it a 2025 life cycle innovation possibly make price somewhat more durable than maybe some people are anticipating. And then the second question, I'll just ask both upfront. Kristian, you got a lot of innovation to spend on for the DTC. And so where do the best returns reside? I can make the argument Librela is the least penetrated but Apoquel and Trio arguably the annuity is longer. So maybe you can talk to how you're balancing the spend and the associated returns. Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Sure, Jon. I'll take the first part of the question, and then Kristin will address the second one. Look, if you look at the stock we've had for the year, it is really been an outstanding start -- we're seeing demand across our innovative products and clearly a balanced growth picture when you look at the quarter with the US growing 12%, international growing 10%. We saw a companion animal growth at 12% and Livestock 9%. To get to your point around price and volume, I will cover the quarter but then I'll remind you of what the first half of the year looks like and what we are anticipating for the balance of the year. The quarter had about 8% price and 3% volume -- now if you look at the price contributions, you have about 2 points coming in from Argentina similar to the first quarter and as we anticipated in the second quarter. And that leaves you with roughly 6 points of price and 3 points of volume. Now I\u2019ll tell you on a year-to-date basis, given where the comps were versus the prior year, you actually have a very balanced picture between price and volume. On a year-to-date basis, we've grown 12% operationally at the top-line. Separating out Argentina, you have 5% price and 5% volume. And that's roughly the balance we expect for the full year. It is just a little bit of nuance on a year-over-year basis based on the comps that is driving much higher volume in Q1 and much higher pricing in Q2. The last point I'll make is Trio had another outstanding quarter, and we are getting better price realization from more targeted promotions. In fact we did not run promotions in the second quarter compared to the last year where we did run a promotion. So that has a little bit of dynamic also playing out on the price picture if you follow that. Again, I'm very pleased with the performance overall stronger price contribution coming from that we expect roughly balanced price volume picture for the year.\nKristin Peck: Thanks. And Jon, I'll take your second question. Look, as you saw in a quarter where we grew derm 18%, the Simparica franchise at 22% and Pain at 142%, clearly, the DTC is having a very positive effect in ROI on each of these. We actually think about it in a much more detailed way than what you were mentioning. We don't just look at it by brand, we look at it by channel. So what is connected TV, TV digital. And there's different ROIs for different. I mean some of these are building markets. As you said, some of these are just more consumer oriented. If you look at parasiticides, consumers really do drive a lot of that spend themselves versus derm and pain, where you have the both the consumer and the veterinary involved. So we look at it both by product. We look at it seasonality. And I'd say, we're investing significantly across all three, where we really believe both there's an opportunity to drive compliance and as well as an opportunity to grow these markets. So we\u2019re aggressively investing across each, but we look at it in a very detailed level to make sure the ROI, any given channel we're investing at any given time of the year makes the most sense.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Thanks for taking my questions. On Librela first. So should we continue to see that sequential ramp in US Librela sales throughout the remainder of the year? And how are reorder rates sellout trends kind of throughout the quarter? How did that progress relative to your expectations and thoughts on potential label changes there as well for Librela? And then my second question is on just the competitive positioning now. I guess -- can you speak to how you're thinking about that now particularly in the dermatology category, but also in parasiticides and how much of the guidance update today was attributable to your view of your competitive positioning for the balance of the year? Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks. I'll take the first question. I'll let Wetteny take the second question on competition across all three. Obviously, very, very pleased with Librela's growth in the quarter to 142%. What we're really seeing and it is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs with OA pain. We've seen a really positive reception. They find it safe and efficacious, and it's really making a real difference. To-date, we have about 18 million doses. We are very pleased with the penetration to-date in the US, which is 80% with the reorder rate of 86%. So to your point on quarter-over-quarter growth continuing to see and expect the rest of the year to see a significant quarter-over-quarter growth in this product. As we mentioned on last call, we are always in ongoing discussions with the FDA, certainly in the first year after launch as they are doing their post-marketing reviews, we have been in those. We have had dialogue with them about possible changes to the Librela label as we've had in many of the other markets we've operated in. In those markets, as you look at it, we continue to see positive trends quarter-over-quarter in Europe after label changes we had in both the EU and the UK in both 2022 and 2023. So these are label changes, as you know, are not uncommon as we talked about last quarter. So we are really excited to see the growth we continue to see in Librela and really the excitement and positive stories from pet owners. So, Wetteny you want to take the second question?\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, when we look at the performance so far, it is been phenomenal across derm, and Trio for the first half of the year, as well as strong contributions obviously coming from our OA pain franchise. You heard the numbers coming in from Librela and Solensia, both in the US with the launch as well as internationally. When we think about the competitive landscape, look clearly, given what we are seeing and what we anticipate continuing because of momentum in the business, we are raising guidance based on the core business. I would say, Derm, in particular when we look at the competitive landscape, we've raised our expectations on derm to double digits. We are seeing high single digits previously. When we look at Trio, the update isn't really meaningful. We were anticipating to be late in the year, comparative launch. Anyway, it's a third to come to market, et cetera. So not any meaningful impact here in terms of how we think about the guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks. Both of my questions are going to be on derm market. So first, just a quick one on Apoquel chewable. You launched that recently, and there was a lot of excitement around that. I was just wondering if you could provide any color on how meaningful a contribution that's having to the better results you are seeing? Or if you think it is more traditional Apoquel that's still driving derm. And are there any inventory dynamics there we should be mindful? Was there any stocking with distributors in the quarter or year-to-date? Just an update on Apoquel chewable and then the follow-up on sort of the long-term opportunity. I think you gave a lot of color in the slides on the opportunity in derm in terms of the underpenetrated market, the untreated opportunity and steps you are taking to further penetrate that. My question is that's been the case for a number of years, and you have had derm on product in the market for over a decade now. So it seems like there is a sizable part of the market that's just resistant to treatment or possibly isn't go into the clinic, isn't amenable to this product? I'm just wondering how real do you think that opportunity is and what the barrier there is? Is that an education? Is that a cost price point? Is that a treatment modality issue. Just why is there still such a sizable unaddressed market in derm and what steps you can do to further penetrate that. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks, Mike. I will take the second question on the long-term opportunity, and then I'll let Wetteny cover anything that I missed as well as cover all the dynamics you're asking for specifically around chewable. To your point, our Derm portfolio has been on the market for 11 years, and we posted 18% growth in the quarter. So I would say that there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand the market. I appreciate your comment on the slide. We did try to add slides this quarter to try to bring to light some of the stories that we're talking about, again, get some of those numbers out there for you. And specifically, what we were trying to address in that is the significant opportunity where we see two drivers really of the future growth. One is around compliance, and we are seeing really strong growth here around compliance. We can increase compliance through retail and auto shift. I even think chewable, which Wetteny will talk about, will help drive compliance. So we think there is a significant opportunity for more weeks and more months on therapy. And I also think there is a big opportunity to continue to expand the market. And building on what Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, there's 3 million dog owners right now that are prescribed to other products such as steroids that could be moved to our product. And then there's 8 million dogs with OA who might be using shampoos or things like that or over-the-counter treatment or might not be using anything at all. We see those as significant opportunities to continue to grow the market. That's 11 million dogs in the US alone. And as I mentioned in my remarks, internationally, we see the same key drivers and same opportunities, but with an additional one, which is that there is still many dogs yet to be medicalized in international. And as those dogs become more medicalized across many countries in China, Brazil, et cetera, we see a significant opportunity there. But I know you asked a number of questions on chewable, which I'll let Wetteny build on it as well as anything else you saw in Derm, you want to mention.\nWetteny Joseph: Look, when I look at the derm picture, Mike I'm very excited about how we are thoughtfully targeting these sub-parts of the business beyond continuing to educate pet owners and so on, which is already benefiting us in terms of the growth we continue to see in this product 11 years later. So clearly, we are penetrating those areas, and we think there are some real ways we can smartly and thoughtfully target. Here above the about 7 million that we are already treating with our products. 11 million that we can go after here in the US alone, and Kristin just touched on that. And so we'll go into more detail on that, but we're very excited about how we are doing that there. In terms of true look, this is largely conversion for Apoquel. So I wouldn't say, that it is necessarily contributing to overall growth, but an important part of our strategy as we look ahead. We've seen the conversion rates outside the US, for example, in those markets in Europe, we have been in for, I think, about 2.5 or so years now -- those are now about 50% penetration in the US, as we ended the quarter, we were approaching about 1/4 conversion. I think we've crossed that since. So we are in that ballpark. So clearly, meaningfully converting from Apoquel, which again is an important part of our business, and we think could long-term contribute to overall growth given the ease of use and preference to pet owners, et cetera.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Vazquez: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe my first question, can you just walk a little bit through the increased guidance, maybe on the top-line and the bottom-line, specifically what is being passed through there. I think not to pick on, it was a great quarter. I think you'd be a little bit more, especially on the organic growth relative to our estimates, and I think less than that beat was passed-through. So just curious if there's puts and takes through the rest of the year that we should be keeping in mind for both sales and EPS on the bottom-line.\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. Look, first of all let me just cover one last piece that I didn't cover on the last call, which was the contribution in terms of stocking around chew and then I will get Brandon, to your question around the guidance and what went into it in terms of puts and takes in top versus bottom. First of all, there is very little contribution in terms of net inventory into distribution on chew, it's about $4 million, so call it 1 percentage point out of the 18, we talked about on key derm globally, so not meaningful at all. Now to your point around the guidance look, we raised the midpoint of our guidance, about 50 basis points the same on the bottom. We are still very much committed and confident in driving operational sort of growth and expansion through the P&L. You've seen about 450 basis points separation between top-line and bottom-line. So clearly, continuing to demonstrate our core value proposition to grow the bottom-line faster than the top-line. I think what you're seeing here in terms of the guide, while it's the same raise at top and bottom in terms of basis points is because we see an opportunity to invest in the business in areas that will drive growth as we exit the year and enter into next year. And as we said continuously, we will make those investments as we see those opportunities, but still, again, sticking to our commitment to driving top and bottom. Now I think as you look at the back half of the year, I will note a couple of things. If you remember last year in the fourth quarter, we have basically an easier comp particularly on just the bottom-line in the fourth quarter, but these investments will impact the operational leverage you see in the third quarter. So we expect that to be not at the levels that you are seeing in Q2 here as you map from the guidance and the implications in the back half. So clearly, that half looks like about a 9% top line growth there at the top, leverage on the back half, but more heavily weighted towards Q4 versus Q3 in terms of that leverage.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nChristopher LoBianco: Hi. This is Chris on for Steve Scala. Thanks for taking our questions. We had just one on dermatology. Can you provide any color on the breakdown of key derm sales between Apoquel, Apoquel chewable and Cytopoint? How do you see this split evolving over time? And does Apoquel chewable provide extended patent protection for the brand? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Sure. I'll cover both here. Look, really when you look at the conversion strategy we have with Apoquel chewable versus Apoquel, we talk about the key derm franchise here versus breaking them out here. So we have 18% growth in key derm. If you look at both Apoquel the Apoquel franchise, as well as Cytopoint with double-digit growth in the quarter. Again, we continue to emphasize the combination of Apoquel and Apoquel chewable versus breaking them out, which is the reason that you heard the commentary from us as you did. In terms of patent protection, look there are various patents that cover the product, both across the active ingredient, as well as the formulation and dosing regimens. So they do very overall, if you look at the franchise, we are looking at patents that extend out to 2031. More details are available in the 10-K, if you want to pull that up from last year. And of course, this year 10-K we\u2019ll cover that.\nOperator: Again we'll take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBalaji Prasad: Hi, good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple for me. Firstly, on -- I wanted to dig a bit into the nuances of pricing. Is there a difference in how pet owners pursue price hikes for pharmaceutical products versus diagnostics? The reason I'm asking is our veterinary survey consistently showing that pet owners are increasingly concerned about spending trends in diagnostics. It seems that this is not applicable on the pharmaceutical side would allow you to take on it, one. Two, could you also just size the fish vaccine business a bit, the growth? And in that context, what would an approval like Alpha Ject Micro translate to in terms of accelerating this revenue growth? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: So look, maybe I'll take a stab at the first one, Balaji. Look, I think you've seen that spend in animal health, particularly pet owners is a doable spend, and they see their pet health as essential. We've seen that time and time again. And every survey we've done given the human animal bond, et cetera, shows that. I think when you look at pet health spend, 86% of pet owners are saying that they would spend whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. We've done market studies as well that demonstrated pet owners had a 20% reduction in their budget, they would still spend the same on their pet health. So clearly, underscoring this importance in terms of the importance of the pet health as a member of the family of pet owners, and we see that show up in terms of our numbers. I don't know if I have a view in terms of how that differentiates between therapeutics versus diagnostics. Clearly, as we look at the picture today, you continue to see strong volume growth in our business, even as you see very robust price as well. So clearly, we see that opportunity to continue to drive the business. That way, we are seeing some price realization. So it is not priced to \u2013 and pet owner is priced into channels in terms of vet clinics, et cetera. But you see our ability to continue to take price and still drive volume in the business given the innovative solutions we're bringing that are addressing chronic conditions for pet owners that they really, really care about. So we think that there's continued room to continue to do that. In terms of the fixed vaccine, I can't speak to the specific vaccine you talked about. Clearly, we saw 20% growth in our fish portfolio this quarter, this is largely driven by demand for vaccines in Norway, a very important market for us, so we are seeing both price and volume. Therefore, perhaps we'll take offline that specific one that you referenced.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nDavid Westenberg: Hi, thank you for taking my question and congrats on great quarter here. So you definitely have products that drive visits in an themselves like Cytopoint and Librela but you also do have wellness dependent products such as vaccines and maybe I'd argue Proheart in that category. Can you talk about how those wellness products have been performing? Your expectation for how they do the rest of the year? And can you help frame the size of that -- those kind of products in your portfolio? And then if I could just squeeze in one smaller one. Were there any portfolio [minute] (ph) sales with your MFA portfolio that you're getting rid of? And why is that portfolio if there isn't more or less portfolio sales dependent? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll take your MFA question, and then I'll let Wetteny take the volumes and things like that across wellness and vaccine. As you think about our medicated feed additive business, as you saw, it was integrated into some of our portfolio contracts, but the majority of those contracts and the majority of the value is Wetteny outlined globally, our MSA sales last year in 2023 were only $400 million. So it's not inconsequential, but it is not a material way of the way we negotiate. Most of our negotiations across portfolio are in more innovative products that are essential to our customers. So no, we are not concerned in livestock, as we sell that business and our ability to continue to leverage our portfolio to provide the best value for our customers. So we're committed to continuing to do that. And I'll let Wetteny take the second question sort of on the wellness.\nWetteny Joseph: Look, David, I think your question on wellness in terms of what's happening across the core portfolio brands versus the rest. I think at the heart of that question is really what's happening around visits, which we have continuously talk about that overall visits on a good indicator for our business, and you see volume growth across our pet care business each quarter even when overall visits are down. Now to get to your point, if you look at Apoquel, Cytopoint, the key derm franchise, if you look at Trio and Simparica franchise and OA pain. Those are all seeing increased volume across the business. I think if you then say what happened to the rest of the portfolio, it contributed about 2 percentage points to our growth. And that's largely price in this quarter, but that's just a dynamic versus the prior year in terms of both timing of when we had some vaccine availability in the prior year that added to supply last year. And therefore, it's a comp item, if you will, and then China has its impact in terms of whether you could the rest of the portfolio. So it's a little bit more price versus volume in the quarter. But overall, typically, we see about 1 to 2 point contribution to growth from the rest of the portfolio. And that's what we're seeing this year. Again, I\u2019d underscore that we are seeing increased volumes across pet care regardless of the overall visit picture. And I think that is really what's important for us to [win with] (ph) our business.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGlen Santangelo: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I maybe want to touch on some of the topics that we just talked about, but -- we get a lot of questions from investors talking about the sluggish sort of pet ownership and vet visit trends and taking all that into the context of a weakening consumer here. And Wetteny, I heard your comments regarding how you view the consumer and your comments regarding how strong the retail channel has been for you all. But could you maybe help us reconcile some of those trends and data points as you think about taking the step to raise guidance in the back half of the year, I mean how conservative are you with respect to the consumer and how you think about those trends in general. Thanks.\nKristin Peck: Thanks. I'll start and see if Wetteny wants to build anything here. I think what you are seeing is the -- you might see an impact in lower spending in pet discretionary -- but we are continuing to see consumer receive pet and medical care as very essential, and they are willing to spend. So if you look in the quarter, we saw about a 4% growth of revenue in the clinics, about 6.2% revenue per visit growth mean obviously, you are referencing the decline in overall clinic visits. But if you look at our US pet care numbers, we outpaced significantly overall in the US with 13% growth in our companion animal business. So we're seeing very strong demand for our products. These pet owners are young, they're affluent. They see the pet as a central member of their family and they are continuing to spend to keep their pets healthy and happy. So we are very optimistic as we look to the rest of this year and confident in the guidance that Wetteny provided and confident honestly, as we look into 2025, the consumer when it comes to essential veterinary care, still is willing to spend. We've done multiple studies as we've referenced before. 86% of pet owners would spend whatever it takes to take care of their pet. And even when faced with a 20% reduction in their income, they would not change what they spend to take care of their pets.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. On derm, is there an updated view on growth for that business in 2024 relative to the comments you made in 1Q just in light of the very strong first half results you've had. And maybe just a second part to the derm question. With your competitor announcing that their product may have a black box warning -- does that change your approach in terms of thinking about how you're thinking about either growing or defending the derm franchise, promotions, marketing, et cetera, as you go through not just the second half of this year about to 2025? Or -- are the plans largely unchanged in light of that update? Thank you.\nWetteny Joseph: Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Look, if we look at the growth, I mentioned earlier on the call, given the competitive dynamics and quite frankly, just the strength of our growth as we continue to expand the market 18% growth in the second quarter. We are raising our expectations for key derm franchise. We said last quarter, it would be high single digits. We're now seeing it\u2019s double-digit growth for 2025. Look, on your question, I'll start on the black box warning and turn it over to Kristin to add any additional points. Clearly, a black box warning is the most serious warning that the FDA will have on a product and when faced against a product that does not have one, also has been in the market for 11 years, over 23 million dogs have been treated with our Apoquel product. The satisfaction levels being above 90% or around 90% both on safety and efficacy that becomes a [total] (ph) order. So clearly, we talked about our excitement, quite frankly around still unmet need out there in terms of undertreated and untreated that we are targeting. We got this competition because we believe on offense here in terms of growing -- expanding use of our products is the best move. We got less of the competition. But clearly, it will position us well versus a product that has a black box label.\nKristin Peck: And the only thing I'd add there is I think what's really exciting about Apoquel is that you don't have to trade off safety and efficacy there. It can be used across all durations of therapy, both acute seasonal and chronic I think the chewable really provides differentiation, especially at the consumer level. You don't have to worry about vaccine status, and it works very, very quickly. So I think that's what also gives us optimism and our potential to continue to grow this franchise.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nNavann Ty: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just had one on Librela. If you had any updated thoughts on the transition to the moderate population, as well as the antitrust investigation in Europe. And then second, on vet visits, and I know that you are not as sensitive as other players, but if you have any outlook for that visit for the full year and next year? Thank you.\nKristin Peck: Sure. First on your question on the EU Commission investigation. It actually has to do with an experimental compound that was part of the Nexvet acquisition, which was about seven years ago. We continue to believe our decision to stop the experimental compound was sound, rigorous and lawful, and we're confident the concerns will be unfounded when they finish their investigation with regards to that. You were asking me how we're doing in international with regards to Librela. Right now, about 65% of the cases are now mild to moderate, which we think is significant progress, this has been a big focus of ours, as we've mentioned on the previous calls. And with regards to your last point, I think on vet visits, we don't really have really good detailed information internationally on vet visits -- so there's not great information. It ranges by market to market, and there's not great sources. So I don't have any specifics I can share there.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Thomas DeBourcy with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nTom DeBourcy: Hello. Thanks for taking the question. Just I guess, Livestock, I know maybe not top against a lot. But even excluding fish, your cattle poultry swine growth was pretty strong in the quarter. And I was just wondering, the last couple of years have been difficult for livestock market with inflation and other pressures. Just whether you see maybe a more sustainable mid or high single-digit growth in that market. I know kind of there is MFAs going get it out there, but just otherwise, whether the market may be improving.\nWetteny Joseph: Yes. So look, great. We saw 9% growth in our livestock portfolio. As you've said continuously, livestock tends to grow the market, somewhere between 2% and 4%. Typically, -- this year, we are seeing increased price, particularly in those hyperinflationary markets like Argentina, for example. And so we would expect livestock as a market to grow towards the higher end of that range. And we believe we will follow that range as well. If you look at what we would expect in our results. I think when you see high single-digit growth rates like this, sometimes it's a comp for example, in the US, ceftiofur had an easier comp versus prior year. So you'll see an uptick in that. But overall, we expect livestock to be in that 2% to 4% range, perhaps a touch above that in this current environment given the pricing environment on those hyperinflation in our markets.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\nKristin Peck: Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today and for your questions. Our ability to seamlessly integrate innovation and execution resulted in what I believe is an outstanding second quarter and first half of 2024, it led us to raise our guidance. And we are very excited about the continued momentum for the rest of the year. I think what we've clearly demonstrated is our ability to generate groundbreaking ideas and translate those into tangible results. We are laser-focused on our strategy to ensure we remain at the forefront of the industry. I believe our diverse and durable portfolio of trusted and best-in-class products positions us well to capitalize on the emerging opportunities and to really redefine how animals are cared for, for the long term. And finally, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all of our dedicated colleagues across the globe. We recently celebrated Purpose Months across our teams and geographies, highlighting how we bring our purpose to life every day with our customers, our communities and each other and their passion for nurturing the world in human time by advancing care for animals, is truly inspiring. Your hard work and commitment are the driving force behind our success. And I want to thank you for everything that you do. And I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call for 2024, we had another outstanding quarter, growing revenue 11% operationally and 18% operational growth in adjusted net income. Success was fueled by strong demand for innovative products, our ability to capture and expand markets and the dedication of our purpose driven colleagues. Segment growth was well-balanced with 12% growth in the US and 10% operational revenue growth internationally even against a strong comparative quarter. Our innovative companion animal portfolio grew 12% operationally, while our livestock portfolio saw 9% operational growth across species and geographies. It's been an excellent first half of 2024, growing revenue 12% operationally, highlighting that our leadership stems from both industry-leading innovation and differentiated execution. We remain focused on our core strategy, delivering consistent results for our customers, the animals and their care and our shareholders and our unwavering commitment to excellence, has resulted in the most diverse and comprehensive animal health portfolio. We lead the industry in R&D investment, bringing over 300 science-driven innovations to market, including three of the top five best-selling products in Animal Health, Apoquel, Simparica Trio and Cytopoint. With our global footprint and world-class manufacturing facilities, we ensure consistent quality and on-time delivery. Our early investments in digital transformation, power and exceptional customer experience, while positioning us for future growth. We continuously refine our commercial strategies and for effective launches and market penetration. And our powerful brand recognition, targeted direct-to-consumer campaigns experienced sales reps and medical experts help us capture new market share and win loyalty. Our customers are at the center of everything we do from understanding their challenges to exceeding their expectations. Scientific innovation enables us to meet their demands while creating new markets, our commercial execution allows us to defend and grow that market leadership. The animal health industry has proven essential and resilient in all types of climates, but it is also dynamic and growing, and we are well-positioned to seize the opportunity. Look no further than our revolutionary osteoarthritis pain franchise, Librela for dogs and Solensia for cats. We are developing a market with breakthrough products that are safer and more effective, while offering convenience for veterinarians and pet owners. The results speak for themselves. Globally, Librela grew 142% operationally this quarter, fueled by the successful and ongoing US launch. But again, its innovation coupled with execution. Take Solensia, for example. Despite launching in Europe three years ago, we reported 60% operational growth this quarter. Our break-throughs are driving increased feline clinic visits, which in turn expands the total market. We along with veterinarians and pet owners are excited about how these safe and efficacious products are revolutionizing first-line treatment for chronic pain in dogs and cats of all ages. Given our proven track-record of building and scaling billion-dollar franchises, we remain confident about the OA pain trajectory, but we don't just launch products, we cultivate them for long-term success. Our key dermatology franchise exemplifies this commitment, delivering strong 18% operational growth driven by Apoquel and Apoquel chewable along with Cytopoint. We have transformed the management of atopic dermatitis in dogs, providing safe, effective and convenient solutions with over 23 million dogs treated globally and a decade of proven results Apoquel is the world's Number #1 prescribed oral medication for allergic itch and it is overwhelmingly endorsed by veterinarians worldwide with approximately 90% satisfaction, reflecting the trust and confidence they place in our market-leading brands. And we are still unlocking the opportunity. Today, there are approximately 20 million dogs globally with undertreated or untreated pruritic itch presenting a vast untapped market. Take the US, for example, we estimate that 10 million dogs are currently receiving veterinary treatment for itch. While the majority or roughly 70% received Apoquel or Cytopoint, there are 3 million dogs prescribed alternative options like steroids. Moreover, an estimated 8 million dogs are treated with over-the-counter products or not treated at all. This highlights the potential addressable market of 11 million dogs in the US, alone that could benefit from our safe and effective therapies. Internationally, the trend is similar with room for even more growth as dogs become increasingly medicalized, underscoring a significant global market opportunity that will fuel our ongoing growth. To solidify our leadership and win new patients, we are focused on DTC marketing to raise awareness, enhance medical education to improve compliance and expanding retail partnerships. Our ability to execute extends to the Simparica franchise, which grew 22% operationally for the quarter. We have not only navigated the changing competitive landscape, but embrace new opportunities with confidence and agility. Several pre trends are fueling our growth. First, pet owner demographics are shifting. They are younger, more affluent and connected by the powerful human animal bond. They are highly engaged and willing to invest in their pet health and well-being. Second, and Wetteny will say more on this. There is a significant channel shift aimed at meeting the evolving needs of these younger pet owners. We are making our products more accessible, ensuring they are available where and when they need them. This combination is a crucial part of our growth strategy, and the results are reflected in our performance. In this dynamic environment, our execution across all phases from launch to expansion to defense, set us apart, showcasing we can introduce, sustain and grow products in a competitive market. Our focus on innovation and execution cuts across every part of the business to create shareholder value. In our livestock portfolio, the sale of our medicated feed additive and certain water-soluble product portfolios remains on track to close in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, we are focusing on innovative solutions for producers, including preventative, antibiotic alternatives and genetics. As the demand for healthy and sustainable animal protein continues to rise, we remain committed to supporting our livestock customers. Our dedication to meeting their needs and adapted to the evolving market conditions ensures that we are well positioned to contribute to their success. Building on our outstanding performance this quarter, we remain confident in our ability to grow faster than the market and through competition as reflected in our raised guidance. While macroeconomic headwinds persist, Animal Health remains resilient and Zoetis' strong operational execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio enable us to navigate all kinds of market conditions effectively. We further demonstrated our commitment to shareholders and confidence in our growth trajectory with the recent announcement of a Board-approved $6 billion share repurchase program, which Wetteny will elaborate on. The animal health landscape is evolving, and our innovations are at the forefront. And while breakthrough innovation is a cornerstone of our strategy, our success is rooted in multiple drivers of growth. We are not just launching new products, we are transforming existing ones to unlock their full potential and better serve customer needs through life cycle innovations. That means taking proven therapies and developing new formulations, uses and delivery methods maximizing their impact and reach. This translates to value created for customers and shareholders alike by allowing us to bring critical new solutions to market faster minimizing development risk and costs by leveraging existing safety profiles of proven products and expanding the reach of established products. Our commitment to life cycle innovation is just one reason we are the leader in animal health. When combined with our market leadership, deep customer insights, strategic investments and our purpose driven colleagues, we are uniquely positioned to deliver against the four tenets of our value proposition. To grow revenues faster than the market, to invest in innovation and growth capabilities to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue and to return excess capital to shareholders. Our differentiated execution and innovative, diverse and durable portfolio ensures we are not just keeping pace, we are setting the pace and redefining what's possible in animal health. With that, let me hand it off to Wetteny. Wetteny? Thanks. And Jon, I'll take your second question. Look, as you saw in a quarter where we grew derm 18%, the Simparica franchise at 22% and Pain at 142%, clearly, the DTC is having a very positive effect in ROI on each of these. We actually think about it in a much more detailed way than what you were mentioning. We don't just look at it by brand, we look at it by channel. So what is connected TV, TV digital. And there's different ROIs for different. I mean some of these are building markets. As you said, some of these are just more consumer oriented. If you look at parasiticides, consumers really do drive a lot of that spend themselves versus derm and pain, where you have the both the consumer and the veterinary involved. So we look at it both by product. We look at it seasonality. And I'd say, we're investing significantly across all three, where we really believe both there's an opportunity to drive compliance and as well as an opportunity to grow these markets. So we're aggressively investing across each, but we look at it in a very detailed level to make sure the ROI, any given channel we're investing at any given time of the year makes the most sense. Thanks. I'll take the first question. I'll let Wetteny take the second question on competition across all three. Obviously, very, very pleased with Librela's growth in the quarter to 142%. What we're really seeing and it is fundamentally improving the quality of life for dogs with OA pain. We've seen a really positive reception. They find it safe and efficacious, and it's really making a real difference. To-date, we have about 18 million doses. We are very pleased with the penetration to-date in the US, which is 80% with the reorder rate of 86%. So to your point on quarter-over-quarter growth continuing to see and expect the rest of the year to see a significant quarter-over-quarter growth in this product. As we mentioned on last call, we are always in ongoing discussions with the FDA, certainly in the first year after launch as they are doing their post-marketing reviews, we have been in those. We have had dialogue with them about possible changes to the Librela label as we've had in many of the other markets we've operated in. In those markets, as you look at it, we continue to see positive trends quarter-over-quarter in Europe after label changes we had in both the EU and the UK in both 2022 and 2023. So these are label changes, as you know, are not uncommon as we talked about last quarter. So we are really excited to see the growth we continue to see in Librela and really the excitement and positive stories from pet owners. So, Wetteny you want to take the second question? Thanks, Mike. I will take the second question on the long-term opportunity, and then I'll let Wetteny cover anything that I missed as well as cover all the dynamics you're asking for specifically around chewable. To your point, our Derm portfolio has been on the market for 11 years, and we posted 18% growth in the quarter. So I would say that there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand the market. I appreciate your comment on the slide. We did try to add slides this quarter to try to bring to light some of the stories that we're talking about, again, get some of those numbers out there for you. And specifically, what we were trying to address in that is the significant opportunity where we see two drivers really of the future growth. One is around compliance, and we are seeing really strong growth here around compliance. We can increase compliance through retail and auto shift. I even think chewable, which Wetteny will talk about, will help drive compliance. So we think there is a significant opportunity for more weeks and more months on therapy. And I also think there is a big opportunity to continue to expand the market. And building on what Wetteny said in his prepared remarks, there's 3 million dog owners right now that are prescribed to other products such as steroids that could be moved to our product. And then there's 8 million dogs with OA who might be using shampoos or things like that or over-the-counter treatment or might not be using anything at all. We see those as significant opportunities to continue to grow the market. That's 11 million dogs in the US alone. And as I mentioned in my remarks, internationally, we see the same key drivers and same opportunities, but with an additional one, which is that there is still many dogs yet to be medicalized in international. And as those dogs become more medicalized across many countries in China, Brazil, et cetera, we see a significant opportunity there. But I know you asked a number of questions on chewable, which I'll let Wetteny build on it as well as anything else you saw in Derm, you want to mention. Sure. I'll take your MFA question, and then I'll let Wetteny take the volumes and things like that across wellness and vaccine. As you think about our medicated feed additive business, as you saw, it was integrated into some of our portfolio contracts, but the majority of those contracts and the majority of the value is Wetteny outlined globally, our MSA sales last year in 2023 were only $400 million. So it's not inconsequential, but it is not a material way of the way we negotiate. Most of our negotiations across portfolio are in more innovative products that are essential to our customers. So no, we are not concerned in livestock, as we sell that business and our ability to continue to leverage our portfolio to provide the best value for our customers. So we're committed to continuing to do that. And I'll let Wetteny take the second question sort of on the wellness. Thanks. I'll start and see if Wetteny wants to build anything here. I think what you are seeing is the -- you might see an impact in lower spending in pet discretionary -- but we are continuing to see consumer receive pet and medical care as very essential, and they are willing to spend. So if you look in the quarter, we saw about a 4% growth of revenue in the clinics, about 6.2% revenue per visit growth mean obviously, you are referencing the decline in overall clinic visits. But if you look at our US pet care numbers, we outpaced significantly overall in the US with 13% growth in our companion animal business. So we're seeing very strong demand for our products. These pet owners are young, they're affluent. They see the pet as a central member of their family and they are continuing to spend to keep their pets healthy and happy. So we are very optimistic as we look to the rest of this year and confident in the guidance that Wetteny provided and confident honestly, as we look into 2025, the consumer when it comes to essential veterinary care, still is willing to spend. We've done multiple studies as we've referenced before. 86% of pet owners would spend whatever it takes to take care of their pet. And even when faced with a 20% reduction in their income, they would not change what they spend to take care of their pets. And the only thing I'd add there is I think what's really exciting about Apoquel is that you don't have to trade off safety and efficacy there. It can be used across all durations of therapy, both acute seasonal and chronic I think the chewable really provides differentiation, especially at the consumer level. You don't have to worry about vaccine status, and it works very, very quickly. So I think that's what also gives us optimism and our potential to continue to grow this franchise. Sure. First on your question on the EU Commission investigation. It actually has to do with an experimental compound that was part of the Nexvet acquisition, which was about seven years ago. We continue to believe our decision to stop the experimental compound was sound, rigorous and lawful, and we're confident the concerns will be unfounded when they finish their investigation with regards to that. You were asking me how we're doing in international with regards to Librela. Right now, about 65% of the cases are now mild to moderate, which we think is significant progress, this has been a big focus of ours, as we've mentioned on the previous calls. And with regards to your last point, I think on vet visits, we don't really have really good detailed information internationally on vet visits -- so there's not great information. It ranges by market to market, and there's not great sources. So I don't have any specifics I can share there. Thank you. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call today and for your questions. Our ability to seamlessly integrate innovation and execution resulted in what I believe is an outstanding second quarter and first half of 2024, it led us to raise our guidance. And we are very excited about the continued momentum for the rest of the year.

            "name": "Wetteny Joseph",
            "content": "Thank you, Kristin, and good morning everyone. As you heard Kristin mention, our ability to execute on our commercial and strategic plans drove another outstanding quarter. We simultaneously executed across product launches, market expansion and market defense to propel us to a strong first-half. In the second quarter, we posted $2.4 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Adjusted net income of $711 million grew 9% on a reported basis and 18% operationally. Quarterly growth was driven by our innovative companion animal portfolio. Globally, OA pain mAbs posted $149 million. Our Simparica franchise posted revenue of $384 million, which includes $299 million from Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise contributed $414 million. Our lifestyle portfolio also saw strong growth with $694 million in revenue. Looking closely at our success and execution. I'd like to focus first on OA pain. As we continue to execute our US launch strategy, we remain confident in our OA pain trajectory. Based on our experience launching other billion-dollar franchises, we know that first-in-class therapies require significantly more market development than lagging look-alikes. In the US, we have reached over 9,000 vets and veterinary technicians through interactive information sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and industry KOLs. This is on top of the thousands of interactions our sales reps and medical teams have had on individual vet visits. These interactions ensure our customers have the tools and resources to reinforce the safety and efficacy of Librela and Solensia with pet owners. Additionally, we are deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. Pet owners know their pets better than anyone, and we want to help them detect the signs of OA and the available treatment options. We know these therapies are improving lives based on the positive testimonials from pet owners. The positive impact and reception of Librela are reflected in the market adoption. In the US, we see record penetration with over 80% of clinics now purchasing the product. No product in our history has penetrated this quickly. Reorder rates are approaching 90%, which is a leading indicator of customer satisfaction. In Europe, shipment is expanding to moderate and mild OA cases that were largely untreated, now making up more than 65% of total cases. This is just a glimpse into what we expect in the US over time, as Librela continues to expand the addressable market and gain market share. Despite our early success, we still have significant room for continued expansion. Our focus on execution doesn't stop after we launch a product. After more than a decade of exceptional safety and efficacy, our key dermatology franchise is still a critical performance driver, growing 18% operationally in the quarter. In the US, derm clinic visits are increasing, driving volume growth across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. The franchise including Apoquel, Apoquel chewable and Cytopoint is designed to cover multiple needs across different dermatological indications and their different methods of administration suit any vet or pet owner preference. Our derm products also address a full spectrum of pruritic cases, providing relief from acute and seasonal conditions, as well as treatment for dogs, with lifelong chronic conditions, which make up the majority of total derm revenue. And vets and pet owners are extremely happy with the results. In global studies, veterinarians report approximately 90% of that satisfaction with Apoquel safety and efficacy. Our comprehensive portfolio meets vets' needs and the needs of their patients, and we are confident in our ability to grow revenue even in the face of competition. That confidence is fueled by the significant opportunities for market expansion that Kristin mentioned earlier. First, we are targeting the 8 million dogs in the US with atopic dermatitis that are either untreated or not treated by a vet through direct-to-consumer advertising, helping to educate pet owners on the signs of an itchy dog and our prescription treatment options. Additionally, in the US, there are 3 million dogs who are prescribed alternative products like steroids. We are confident in our ability to win these new customers through our proven safety and efficacy. We are also drawing more doses from the same patient base due to trends within pet health care, including [preference for] (ph) injectable therapies, chewable formulations and alternative channel growth, increasing compliance. Lastly, there are many markets where our key dermatology franchise is in the early stages of maturity. These markets should provide long-term growth trajectory and our outstanding international growth highlights this momentum. Our excellence in execution on our OA pain launches and key dermatology expansion has contributed to a great first half of the year. Now let us move on to our segment results. US revenue grew 12% in the quarter, with companion animal growing 13% and livestock posting 11% growth. For the first time, sales across our US companion animal portfolio surpassed $1 billion in the quarter. Performance was driven by our OA pain mAbs, Simparica Trio and our key dermatology franchise. Portfolio growth was largely driven by trends in retail and home delivery, reflecting the evolution of pet-owner preference for convenience and increased compliance on dispensing oral medications. In the clinic, usage of injectable therapeutic treatment is going to offset the alternative channel shift. Our pain mAbs, Librela and Solensia posted a combined $71 million in US sales in Q2. Librela generated $53 million, primarily on increased clinic utilization. As I mentioned to-date, market adoption is higher than any product in our history. Thus, we are confident in our trajectory. Solensia posted $18 million in revenue. We continue to be pleased with what we are seeing in the feline OA space. As Kristin mentioned, we see positive trends in feline OA visits which have nearly doubled since our launch almost two years ago. Simparica Trio posted US growth of 19% in the quarter on $254 million in revenue. We are entering our second year with competition in the triple combination parasiticide market, and we continue to execute on not just defending our leadership position with Trio, but growing it. Again we do not take a launch and done mentality. We posted 26% moving average total growth over the past 12 months. The majority of which was in a competitive market, highlighting not only our first mover advantage, but also the stickiness of our customer base. Lastly, in the vet channel, Simparica Trio is winning with Puppies, a leading indicator of future performance. In the absence of meaningful differentiation, vets and pet owners are reluctant to switch from a safe, efficacious product. The dermatology product sales in the US were $283 million for the quarter growing 17%. Apoquel was the largest growth driver with Apoquel chewable benefiting from increased conversion. Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable solutions, especially for chronic cases. Earlier, Kristin alluded to shifting pet owner demographics in the evolving landscape. Much of our success with Simparica Trio and Apoquel has been bolstered by our ability to win in the growing retail and home delivery space. The convenience of these channels for self-administered products are increasingly popular with pet owners, and we are committed to making our products available where our customers need them. Currently, Simparica Trio is the best-selling prescription products in the retail channel and Apoquel is second. We estimate that over 20% of Trio sales and one-third of Apoquel sales now come via the retail channel. Additionally, the alternative channel growth rate for both Trio and Apoquel exceeded overall growth rate for these products this quarter. Growing pet owner preference for alternative channel convenience, has led to a decline in product-only clinic visits. This is why visits are not the best indicator of our performance, given we have consistently grown volume in an evolving landscape. Our US companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 5% in the quarter, [returning to growth] (ph) after Q1 distributor inventory work downs following our channel strategies change. US Livestock had a strong quarter, growing 11% driven primarily from the timing of supply on ceftiofur, which had a soft comparable period last year. Moving on to our International segment. Revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 12% operationally and Livestock grew 8% operationally. Our international companion animal portfolio growth was driven by our Simparica, key dermatology and OA pain franchises, partially offset by impact in China. Our international Simparica franchise grew 35% operationally. Growth was driven by Simparica, growing 38% operationally to $59 million in sales in the quarter. We continue to see increased use in Latin America and Eastern Europe, as well as price benefits in high inflationary markets. Simparica Trio grew 31% operationally on $45 million in sales benefiting from key account growth in Europe, continued focus on DTC and the positive impact of our recent launch in China. Our key dermatology franchise grew 19% operationally in the quarter posting $131 million in sales. We saw double digit growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was partially offset by headwinds in Japan due to pre-price buy-ins in Q1. As we highlighted earlier, we continue to see significant opportunity for growth. Many international markets are in the early stages of market development with significant runway for growth. Internationally, our OA pain mAbs grew 35% operationally, posting $79 million in combined revenue. International Librela sales were $63 million growing 32% operationally. As we highlighted last quarter, we have lapped the launches in our last significant international markets, which occurred in Q2 of 2023. Solensia sales were $16 million, growing 49% operationally. Our international companion animal diagnostics portfolio grew 15% operationally with strong performance across much of Asia and Europe. International companion animal growth was partially offset by expected declines in China, driven by Revolution franchise. International livestock grew 8% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases, primarily in cattle and poultry in high inflationary markets. We saw strong growth in our fish portfolio this quarter with contributions from price and volume driven by strong demand for vaccines in Norway. Growth in price and fish was partially offset by volume declines in most of our other livestock species, due to a challenging comparable quarter as well as the impact of unfavorable rotations. As expected the economic challenges in China persist, putting pressure on certain companion animal products, as well as livestock, especially in swine. Consistent with what we have said for several quarters, the impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but continued headwinds are expected throughout the year across companion animal and livestock. [Physical] (ph) discipline across the P&L is one of the things that unlocks successful execution. As we move on to some of the highlights, we wanted to reaffirm our continued commitment to reinvesting in our business and our confidence in the returns we see from those investments. Adjusted gross margins of 71.7% declined 70 basis points on a reported basis. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 130 basis points. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases favorable mix and lower freight costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in high inflationary markets. Adjusted operating expenses increased 9% operationally contributing to this growth was SG&A increases of 7% operationally and 17% operational growth in R&D. Improvements in operational gross margin and prudent expense growth contributed to adjusted net income which grew 18% operationally. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 20% operationally for the quarter. Lastly, I want to highlight our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we repurchased a record high $533 million in shares. Additionally, on August 1, we announced that we received board approval for a new $6 billion share repurchase program, our largest program to-date. The shares are expected to be repurchased over a multiyear period of up to four years, and the program can be canceled at any time. The company's previous $3.5 billion share repurchase program, which was approved in December 2021 is expected to be completed this year. This commitment reflects continued confidence in our ability to return value to shareholders. Before moving to guidance, an update on the planned divestiture of our Medicated Feed Additives portfolio. As Kristin mentioned, we are expecting this divestiture to close some time in the second half. Our current guidance is not reflective of the sale and may be adjusted subsequent to the close of the deal. As we stated in our April announcement, this portfolio generated approximately $400 million in revenue in 2023 with roughly linear seasonality. Now moving on to guidance for full year 2024. Our outstanding first half performance particularly in our Simparica and key dermatology franchises, demonstrated our ability to drive growth through execution across our business and gives us confidence going forward. Thus, we are raising our 2024 guidance provided during May's earnings call. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates of late July. For the year, we expect revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.25 billion, a range of 9% to 11% operational growth. As we stated earlier, our OA pain trajectory remains on track. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. We now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.64 billion to $2.69 billion, representing operational growth of 13.5% to 15.5%. We are maintaining our commitment to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue over the long-term, while increasing our investment in demand generating activities such as direct-to-consumer advertising. While we saw exceptional leverage this quarter, subsequent quarters may have -- may not have the same level of operating leverage, due to the optimal timing of investments. Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.78 to $5.88 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.45. In closing before we go to Q&A, the strength and diversity of our portfolio and our relationships, as well as our ability to execute on our strategic vision, continually allows us to outperform our peers. We have the utmost confidence in our best-in-class portfolio and colleagues to continue to set the benchmark moving forward. Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? Sure, Jon. I'll take the first part of the question, and then Kristin will address the second one. Look, if you look at the stock we've had for the year, it is really been an outstanding start -- we're seeing demand across our innovative products and clearly a balanced growth picture when you look at the quarter with the US growing 12%, international growing 10%. We saw a companion animal growth at 12% and Livestock 9%. To get to your point around price and volume, I will cover the quarter but then I'll remind you of what the first half of the year looks like and what we are anticipating for the balance of the year. The quarter had about 8% price and 3% volume -- now if you look at the price contributions, you have about 2 points coming in from Argentina similar to the first quarter and as we anticipated in the second quarter. And that leaves you with roughly 6 points of price and 3 points of volume. Now I'll tell you on a year-to-date basis, given where the comps were versus the prior year, you actually have a very balanced picture between price and volume. On a year-to-date basis, we've grown 12% operationally at the top-line. Separating out Argentina, you have 5% price and 5% volume. And that's roughly the balance we expect for the full year. It is just a little bit of nuance on a year-over-year basis based on the comps that is driving much higher volume in Q1 and much higher pricing in Q2. The last point I'll make is Trio had another outstanding quarter, and we are getting better price realization from more targeted promotions. In fact we did not run promotions in the second quarter compared to the last year where we did run a promotion. So that has a little bit of dynamic also playing out on the price picture if you follow that. Again, I'm very pleased with the performance overall stronger price contribution coming from that we expect roughly balanced price volume picture for the year. Sure. Look, when we look at the performance so far, it is been phenomenal across derm, and Trio for the first half of the year, as well as strong contributions obviously coming from our OA pain franchise. You heard the numbers coming in from Librela and Solensia, both in the US with the launch as well as internationally. When we think about the competitive landscape, look clearly, given what we are seeing and what we anticipate continuing because of momentum in the business, we are raising guidance based on the core business. I would say, Derm, in particular when we look at the competitive landscape, we've raised our expectations on derm to double digits. We are seeing high single digits previously. When we look at Trio, the update isn't really meaningful. We were anticipating to be late in the year, comparative launch. Anyway, it's a third to come to market, et cetera. So not any meaningful impact here in terms of how we think about the guidance. Look, when I look at the derm picture, Mike I'm very excited about how we are thoughtfully targeting these sub-parts of the business beyond continuing to educate pet owners and so on, which is already benefiting us in terms of the growth we continue to see in this product 11 years later. So clearly, we are penetrating those areas, and we think there are some real ways we can smartly and thoughtfully target. Here above the about 7 million that we are already treating with our products. 11 million that we can go after here in the US alone, and Kristin just touched on that. And so we'll go into more detail on that, but we're very excited about how we are doing that there. In terms of true look, this is largely conversion for Apoquel. So I wouldn't say, that it is necessarily contributing to overall growth, but an important part of our strategy as we look ahead. We've seen the conversion rates outside the US, for example, in those markets in Europe, we have been in for, I think, about 2.5 or so years now -- those are now about 50% penetration in the US, as we ended the quarter, we were approaching about 1/4 conversion. I think we've crossed that since. So we are in that ballpark. So clearly, meaningfully converting from Apoquel, which again is an important part of our business, and we think could long-term contribute to overall growth given the ease of use and preference to pet owners, et cetera. Sure. Look, first of all let me just cover one last piece that I didn't cover on the last call, which was the contribution in terms of stocking around chew and then I will get Brandon, to your question around the guidance and what went into it in terms of puts and takes in top versus bottom. First of all, there is very little contribution in terms of net inventory into distribution on chew, it's about $4 million, so call it 1 percentage point out of the 18, we talked about on key derm globally, so not meaningful at all. Now to your point around the guidance look, we raised the midpoint of our guidance, about 50 basis points the same on the bottom. We are still very much committed and confident in driving operational sort of growth and expansion through the P&L. You've seen about 450 basis points separation between top-line and bottom-line. So clearly, continuing to demonstrate our core value proposition to grow the bottom-line faster than the top-line. I think what you're seeing here in terms of the guide, while it's the same raise at top and bottom in terms of basis points is because we see an opportunity to invest in the business in areas that will drive growth as we exit the year and enter into next year. And as we said continuously, we will make those investments as we see those opportunities, but still, again, sticking to our commitment to driving top and bottom. Now I think as you look at the back half of the year, I will note a couple of things. If you remember last year in the fourth quarter, we have basically an easier comp particularly on just the bottom-line in the fourth quarter, but these investments will impact the operational leverage you see in the third quarter. So we expect that to be not at the levels that you are seeing in Q2 here as you map from the guidance and the implications in the back half. So clearly, that half looks like about a 9% top line growth there at the top, leverage on the back half, but more heavily weighted towards Q4 versus Q3 in terms of that leverage. Sure. I'll cover both here. Look, really when you look at the conversion strategy we have with Apoquel chewable versus Apoquel, we talk about the key derm franchise here versus breaking them out here. So we have 18% growth in key derm. If you look at both Apoquel the Apoquel franchise, as well as Cytopoint with double-digit growth in the quarter. Again, we continue to emphasize the combination of Apoquel and Apoquel chewable versus breaking them out, which is the reason that you heard the commentary from us as you did. In terms of patent protection, look there are various patents that cover the product, both across the active ingredient, as well as the formulation and dosing regimens. So they do very overall, if you look at the franchise, we are looking at patents that extend out to 2031. More details are available in the 10-K, if you want to pull that up from last year. And of course, this year 10-K we'll cover that. So look, maybe I'll take a stab at the first one, Balaji. Look, I think you've seen that spend in animal health, particularly pet owners is a doable spend, and they see their pet health as essential. We've seen that time and time again. And every survey we've done given the human animal bond, et cetera, shows that. I think when you look at pet health spend, 86% of pet owners are saying that they would spend whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care. We've done market studies as well that demonstrated pet owners had a 20% reduction in their budget, they would still spend the same on their pet health. So clearly, underscoring this importance in terms of the importance of the pet health as a member of the family of pet owners, and we see that show up in terms of our numbers. I don't know if I have a view in terms of how that differentiates between therapeutics versus diagnostics. Clearly, as we look at the picture today, you continue to see strong volume growth in our business, even as you see very robust price as well. So clearly, we see that opportunity to continue to drive the business. That way, we are seeing some price realization. So it is not priced to \u2013 and pet owner is priced into channels in terms of vet clinics, et cetera. But you see our ability to continue to take price and still drive volume in the business given the innovative solutions we're bringing that are addressing chronic conditions for pet owners that they really, really care about. So we think that there's continued room to continue to do that. In terms of the fixed vaccine, I can't speak to the specific vaccine you talked about. Clearly, we saw 20% growth in our fish portfolio this quarter, this is largely driven by demand for vaccines in Norway, a very important market for us, so we are seeing both price and volume. Therefore, perhaps we'll take offline that specific one that you referenced. Look, David, I think your question on wellness in terms of what's happening across the core portfolio brands versus the rest. I think at the heart of that question is really what's happening around visits, which we have continuously talk about that overall visits on a good indicator for our business, and you see volume growth across our pet care business each quarter even when overall visits are down. Now to get to your point, if you look at Apoquel, Cytopoint, the key derm franchise, if you look at Trio and Simparica franchise and OA pain. Those are all seeing increased volume across the business. I think if you then say what happened to the rest of the portfolio, it contributed about 2 percentage points to our growth. And that's largely price in this quarter, but that's just a dynamic versus the prior year in terms of both timing of when we had some vaccine availability in the prior year that added to supply last year. And therefore, it's a comp item, if you will, and then China has its impact in terms of whether you could the rest of the portfolio. So it's a little bit more price versus volume in the quarter. But overall, typically, we see about 1 to 2 point contribution to growth from the rest of the portfolio. And that's what we're seeing this year. Again, I'd underscore that we are seeing increased volumes across pet care regardless of the overall visit picture. And I think that is really what's important for us to [win with] (ph) our business. Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. Look, if we look at the growth, I mentioned earlier on the call, given the competitive dynamics and quite frankly, just the strength of our growth as we continue to expand the market 18% growth in the second quarter. We are raising our expectations for key derm franchise. We said last quarter, it would be high single digits. We're now seeing it's double-digit growth for 2025. Look, on your question, I'll start on the black box warning and turn it over to Kristin to add any additional points. Clearly, a black box warning is the most serious warning that the FDA will have on a product and when faced against a product that does not have one, also has been in the market for 11 years, over 23 million dogs have been treated with our Apoquel product. The satisfaction levels being above 90% or around 90% both on safety and efficacy that becomes a [total] (ph) order. So clearly, we talked about our excitement, quite frankly around still unmet need out there in terms of undertreated and untreated that we are targeting. We got this competition because we believe on offense here in terms of growing -- expanding use of our products is the best move. We got less of the competition. But clearly, it will position us well versus a product that has a black box label. Yes. So look, great. We saw 9% growth in our livestock portfolio. As you've said continuously, livestock tends to grow the market, somewhere between 2% and 4%. Typically, -- this year, we are seeing increased price, particularly in those hyperinflationary markets like Argentina, for example. And so we would expect livestock as a market to grow towards the higher end of that range. And we believe we will follow that range as well. If you look at what we would expect in our results. I think when you see high single-digit growth rates like this, sometimes it's a comp for example, in the US, ceftiofur had an easier comp versus prior year. So you'll see an uptick in that. But overall, we expect livestock to be in that 2% to 4% range, perhaps a touch above that in this current environment given the pricing environment on those hyperinflation in our markets."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis. \n The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. \n In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of the call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. \n [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin. \nSteven Frank: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Wetteny Joseph, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. \n For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. \n Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, Thursday, May 2, 2024. \n We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. \n And with that, I will turn the call over to Kristin. \nKristin Peck: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for 2024. \n Today, we reported outstanding first quarter results, underscored by steady demand for our products, a focused strategy and our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 12% operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income 15% operationally in line with the tenet of our value proposition. \n Driven by the launch of our osteoarthritis pain franchise, the U.S. led the way with 16% growth and 8% operational growth internationally. More specifically, globally, Librela grew 189% operationally, including $40 million in sales in the U.S., in line with our expectations. \n The powerful human animal bond fueled demand for our companion animal portfolio with 20% growth operationally, while livestock declined 1% operationally. \n This quarter's results even amidst global uncertainty are a testament, once again, to the power of our diverse and durable portfolio across markets, species and therapeutic areas. It also highlights the continued rise and resilience of the animal health industry. \n Our purpose and performance are rooted in science, which has always been the great disruptor. And as animal health is increasingly essential for nutrition and companionship, caregivers demand even more high-quality innovation. That means we identify the most prevalent area of unmet veterinary needs and invest in, develop, manufacture and deliver life-changing products that customers have been waiting for. \n Take, for example, Librela and Solensia, our injectable monoclonal antibodies to treat OA pain in dogs and cats, which are helping millions of pets return to play. With more than 18 million doses distributed worldwide, we are providing long-lasting relief to animals, many of whom were previously undiagnosed or untreated due to limitations of NSAIDs. With nearly 40% of all dogs suffering from OA pain globally, we believe just 1/3 of those are being treated. So we're just scratching the surface of care. \n And cats are visiting the clinic more often. In fact, we're helping curb clinic fears with Bonqat, the first FDA-approved product to alleviate anxiety in cat, which means we're expanding care in a historically under-medicalized area of the market. \n We understand that social media is a form for convening, a place for pet owners to connect and to share, but we also have responsibility to empower our customers to make informed decisions grounded in science and data. \n We are unwavering in our commitment to rigorous safety and quality standards, which has earned us the trust and confidence of veterinarians worldwide. Backed by that commitment, Librela and Solensia are safe and effective. They are anchored in 10 years of science and have been used in Europe for more than 3 years. \n In the U.S., 78% of veterinarians who are at the center of care are very satisfied with Librela. This is driven by real-world experience and consistent with the feedback we hear in other markets. And our research indicates that 46% of vet globally will treat OA earlier and 65% will treat more dogs now that Librela is available. \n To accurately reaffirm the safety and efficacy of these therapies, we are doubling down, working directly with veterinarians who need these products, hosting live sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and expanding online education and training while deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. \n And veterinarians continue to be confident in Librela as evidenced by a recent blind survey of U.S. vets confirming that perception, and intent to prescribe remain unchanged. \n We remain confident that OA pain could be our next $1 billion franchise because we are meeting the needs of an underserved market. We are growing by nearly every metric, including adoption, penetration, reorder rates, patient share and expanded utilization. And looking at our 4-week rolling average in the U.S., we're excited to report that sales steadily increased through April. Our performance speaks to the power of the human animal bond. Discerning pet owners want options, and they will work with their vets to find relief for their best friends. \n Beyond OA pain, Zoetis has been able to lead the market in other key categories because we deeply understand our customers' needs. This allows us to not only compete in existing markets, but again, to create entirely new ones. And science has created something completely unique to our industry, two $1 billion franchises. \n Our parasiticide portfolio expanded the total market based on deep customer insights. Before Simparica and Simparica Trio, we were #5 in this category. These innovations changed how we compete. Today, we are #2 and continue gaining share and growing the market even in the face of competition. \n Similarly, we were first to recognize that new therapies were needed to treat canine itch safely and effectively. That market foresight changed the treatment paradigm and revolutionized pet care. A decade of dermatology has led to 3 products; 20 major life cycle enhancements, including Cytopoint, the first ever animal health monoclonal antibody and the first chewable with Apoquel chew. \n From what was once believed to be just a $100 million market has grown to $1.4 billion because we know what our customers need. Today, more than 18 million dogs are treated for allergic itch and atopic dermatitis and another 13 million remain untreated globally. We built a $1 billion franchise and demonstrated the durability of our portfolio. And we will continue growing this franchise underpinned by strong brand equity, first-mover advantage, life cycle innovations and strong customer relationships. \n We've led in parasiticides, dermatology and now OA pain. And each time our innovations have created new categories in animal health, you've seen the total industry opportunity expand. \n Now moving to livestock. I'm sure you all saw the news this week on the announcement of our agreement with Phibro Animal Health to sell our global medicated feed additives and certain water-soluble product portfolios and related assets for $350 million. This deal is another great example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus investments in areas with the greatest growth potential and innovation that are aligned with our key capabilities. \n I'm confident that under Phibro's management, the global reach of these products will continue to expand to meet customer needs worldwide. We remain very committed to livestock and just sharpening our focus and our core innovative livestock growth areas, including preventative antibiotic alternatives and genetics. \n In summary, for more than 70 years, Zoetis has been leading the industry with our commitment to innovation. We've invested over $5 billion in R&D since our IPO, which has brought more than 300 product lines to the market. Science is and always has been the great disruptor and at the core of our success in delivering the innovations that veterinarians, livestock producers and pet owners expect from us. \n Our pursuit of science has led to breakthroughs in dermatology, like Cytopoint and Apoquel chew; in parasiticide with Simparica Trio; and now the latest in OA pain with Librela and Solensia that are revolutionizing animal health. \n Blazing new trails isn't easy. But time and again, our purpose-driven colleagues have proven their ability to expand our industry leadership and forge entirely new markets. \n And we remain committed to delivering strong growth through our innovative franchises and diverse portfolio while continuing to invest for the future. \n Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024, our increased operational guidance reflects the resilience of the animal health market and the execution of our strategic growth priorities. We will continue to be disciplined, yet adaptable in our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that occurred throughout the year. \n And with that, I will turn it over to Wetteny. \nWetteny Joseph: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had an outstanding start to the year driven by the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, particularly our innovative products, as well as price growth across all species. \n In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 10% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. \n Adjusted net income of $634 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 15% on an operational basis. \n Our 12% operational revenue growth was due to the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, aided by the impact of a weak comparative quarter in our U.S. companion animal business. However, the majority of this [ probability ] to growth was offset by headwinds related to economic conditions in China, the impact of a tough comparative quarter in livestock due to the timing of supply for certain products last year and inventory destocking related to our U.S. diagnostics sales model change. \n Of the 12% operational revenue growth, 7% is from price with 5% growth in volume. While we saw price growth across our portfolio, price was favorably impacted by hyperinflationary markets, especially Argentina, which contributed 2% to our overall price growth. \n The volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia, as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio. \n On a segment basis, the U.S. posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 16% on the quarter, while our International segment reported revenue of $1 billion with operational growth of 8% in the quarter. \n Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in Q1, growing 20% operationally. This growth was partially offset by livestock, which declined 1% on an operational basis. \n We saw double-digit operational companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our International segments again this quarter, driven by the strong performance of our innovative products with contributions from both volume and price. \n Simparica Trio was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, generating $243 million globally, representing operational growth of 61%. We saw strong demand for Trio as well as continued growth in patient share even with competition. \n Our OA pain meds were also a significant contributor to growth, posting $131 million in the quarter. Global growth came from the impact of new launch markets, both in the U.S. and internationally. In our early launch EU markets, recent vet surveys showed an increase in muscle on therapy and expansion into more moderate OA cases. \n Our key dermatology products grew 25% operationally in the quarter with $360 million in global revenue. Growth within dermatology was driven primarily by our Apoquel franchise, where we are seeing solid conversion to Apoquel Chewable, including a modest impact from initial distributor stocking in the U.S. \n Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable methods of treatment. \n Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 12% operationally with declines in the U.S. driven by our distribution model change. These declines were anticipated as our distribution partners sold off their remaining inventory due to our transition to a direct-only model for our U.S. diagnostics portfolio. U.S. declines were partially offset by growth internationally. \n Our livestock portfolio declined 1% operationally, as expected, driven by a tough comparative quarter in the prior year especially in the U.S. as well as impacts from the ongoing economic conditions in China. This decline was partially offset by price growth in our other International markets. \n Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 16% with companion animal growth of 25% and livestock posting a 7% decline. The companion animal performance in the quarter was driven by Simparica Trio, our key dermatology portfolio, and the impact of the launch of Librela in the U.S. as well as the impact of a weak comparative quarter. \n Our outstanding U.S. companion animal growth came in the quarter where we saw vet clinic visits decrease 1.5%. We continued to see growth in the therapeutic visits while wellness visits drove the decline. \n Sales outgrowth in the retail and home delivery continued to outpace vet clinic fulfillment, which is based on growing pet owner preference for these alternative channels. This dynamic is expected to put continued pressure on total vet clinic visits without impacting our expectations for revenue. \n Despite the visit decline, revenue and spend per visit in the clinic grew 4.5% and 6%, respectively, which reflects continued pet owner willingness to pay. \n Turning to product performance. Simparica Trio posted sales of $205 million in the quarter, growing 61%. We continue to be the market leader in the triple-combination parasiticide space. Our leading footprint across channels has allowed us to continue to drive dosage growth through increased compliance even with declines in wellness visits at the clinic. \n In addition to a weak comparable period in the prior year, we are seeing favorable price realization due to more targeted discount programs to vets as well as channel dynamics. \n The dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $233 million for the quarter, growing 27%. We saw growth in both price and volume and across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. Both also benefited from a weak comparable period in the prior year. \n Market demand for our dermatology products remained high. In the quarter, we saw growth in both our patient share as well as higher periodic visits in the clinic. Additionally, growth of retail autoship programs continued to bolster compliance. At the beginning of April, we made Apoquel Chewable available through our distribution partners. \n Our pain meds, Librela and Solensia, posted a combined $57 million in U.S. sales in Q1. Librela generated $40 million in the quarter with underlying vet demand continuing to build on the momentum from our full launch in Q4 of last year. Excluding the impact of the initial clinic stocking, which we have provided last quarter, we are seeing robust sequential quarter growth in Librela, in line with expectations. \n We continued to see good growth in penetration as well as strong reorder rates, which are approaching 80%, all of which points to positive real-world satisfaction in the clinic and among pet owners. \n We remain confident not just in the safety and efficacy of Librela, but also in our expected performance. As Kristin alluded to, we have seen steady increasing trends in our trailing 4-week sales average in the U.S., even into April, after the increased media attention. \n We continued to see steady progress in Solensia, which had U.S. sales of $17 million in the quarter, more than doubling our prior year Q1 sales. We have indicated the feline market needs significant development, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. \n Solensia is now the market-leading product for feline OA pain in the U.S., and we have seen a significant increase in the medicalized patient pool since launch. \n Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 21% in the quarter, driven primarily by distributor inventory work-downs following our channel strategy change. This destocking is in line with our expectations and has negligible impact on our underlying clinic demand. \n U.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter while our underlying business performance in the quarter was as expected. Our results are reflective of a strong comparative period in Q1 of 2023, in which we grew 15% due to the return of supply on several products, primarily in cattle. \n Sales of swine products declined due to decreased sales of vaccines as well as JAKs. \n In poultry, we saw declines as a result of increased generic competition in our medicated feed additive products. \n Moving on to our International segment where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 14% operationally and livestock grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of our international companion animal products were driven by oral pain meds, key dermatology products, vaccines and small animal parasiticides. This growth was partially offset by impacts in China. \n Our International OA pain meds grew 67% operationally to $74 million in combined revenue in the quarter. International Librela sales were $l59 million, growing 71% operationally. Growth is balanced across new launch markets and our first wave EU markets. \n We continue to see evolution in the European markets, where we have seen expansion in Librela's use in moderate OA cases, which according to the latest vet surveys now represents the majority of the Librela patients in Europe. We remain pleased with the success of our DTC advertising campaigns in increasing pet owner awareness of OA. \n Solensia sales were $15 million internationally in the quarter, growing 54% on an operational basis. Our International key dermatology portfolio grew 23% operationally in the quarter, posting $127 million in sales. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was also favorably impacted by prepriced increased buy-ups in Japan and certain European markets. \n Our International small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 6% operationally driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica Trio growing 58% operationally to $38 million in sales. Trio growth benefited from continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and sales force effectiveness as well as contributions from Trio's launch in China. \n Simparica posted $56 million in revenue, growing 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 29% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China. \n International livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases as in high inflationary markets. Price growth was partially offset by volume declines across all of our species, partially driven by a tough comparative period in the prior year due to the return of supply of certain livestock products. \n The volume declines in livestock were driven by cattle due to a tough comparable period related to supply and worsening market conditions in Australia. Our International swine portfolio saw volume declines driven by China, where we saw lower hog prices as well as a reduction in herd sizes. \n In sheep, we saw declines from herd reductions due to expected weather conditions in Australia and New Zealand as well as supply constraints on a key product. \n As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see economic challenges in China, where low consumer spending and higher urban unemployment have reduced spending. We are also seeing a slowdown in livestock with lower pork prices and smaller herd sizes. The impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but we expect to continue to see headwinds throughout the year across both companion animal and livestock. \n Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.7% declined 10 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 180 basis points on our reported adjusted gross margins. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases, favorable mix and lower freight costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in hyperinflationary markets. \n Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by SG&A growth of 10% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased advertising and promotion spend on our OA pain meds. \n R&D grew 13% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend related to both recent acquisitions as well as advancements of our pipeline candidates. \n The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, a decrease of 80 basis points, primarily due to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. \n And finally, adjusted net income grew 15% operationally despite a $31 million headwind to growth from the nonrecurring benefit of our prior year royalty settlement. \n Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. \n Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $140 million. \n In the quarter, we repurchased $339 million of Zoetis shares. \n Before moving to guidance, I wanted to comment on our recent announcement to divest our medicated food additive portfolio and certain water-soluble products to Phibro Animal Health. This is a transaction that demonstrates Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus our investments on innovative solutions that advance animal health, productivity and sustainability. This divestiture will allow us to remain focused on other livestock solutions, including vaccine, biologic and genetic programs that are more aligned with our strategic priorities. \n Now moving on to guidance for full year 2024. As we have mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter that highlighted our ability to deliver through multiple sources of growth. Our performance in companion animal, especially in parasiticides and our key dermatology franchises, exceeded our expectations. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with the progress of the U.S. launch of Librela and are confident in our ability to meet expectations. \n We are, therefore, raising our 2024 operational guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. The updated foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our reported revenue guidance by approximately 2% and our reported adjusted net income guidance by approximately 4% when compared to our initial guidance issued in February. \n For the year, we expect revenue between $9.05 billion and $9.20 billion, representing a range of 8.5% to 10.5% operational growth. Our increase in operational growth is reflective of Argentina's pricing impact as well as due to performance in our companion animal parasiticides and key dermatology products. \n We now expect our full year operational growth for Simparica Trio to be double digit while we expect growth in our key dermatology products to be in the high single-digit range. \n As we stated earlier, we remain pleased with our U.S. launch of Librela. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. \n Moving down the P&L. we now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.67 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%. \n And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.71 to $5.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. \n Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are very pleased with our start to the year. While our reported results are reflective of various foreign exchange-related headwinds, operationally, we continued to deliver growth across our key therapeutic areas and across most of our major markets. This growth highlights the diversity and dependability that allows us to continually outpace the animal health market. Additionally, we continue to lead the way, creating new markets and launching new innovation that increases the standard of medical care for animals. \n Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] With that, we will take our first question. It's coming from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. \nMichael Ryskin: Great. First, I want to ask just about the guide change. It seems like there's just so many moving pieces right now: the FX moves, you've got all the price you're taking in Argentina, some of the stocking comments for Apoquel Chewable, and obviously, Librela. Just this early in the year to decide to raise the guide, just sort of like what went into that? And what do you see as the upside risks or downside risks to that as you go through the year? \n And then just a quick follow-up question, and I'll squeeze both in. My question is on margin. With all the price, with all the strength in companion, gross margin was still a little bit weaker in the quarter and you're not raising EPS operationally for the year. So just what's going on with the gross margin and why isn't the flow-through for the companion animal portfolio better? \nWetteny Joseph: I'll be happy to take this, Mike. Look, we're very pleased with an outstanding quarter to start the year, clearly delivering 12% operational growth at revenue; 15% at adjusted net income from an operational perspective. Couldn't be more pleased with this. \n In terms of the guidance, of course, there are puts and takes, as you laid out. The performance in the quarter, when we think about the prior year comps, we think these are largely offsetting puts and takes that go into the performance. And I think that feeds into the later part of your question, which is how do we decide to go into increasing our guidance from an operational perspective. \n But when you look at the puts and takes, clearly the performance from our Trio and key derm, seeing growth as we continue to ramp the launch of Librela not only in the U.S., but across International markets gave us a lot of confidence in terms of underpinning the growth that you saw in the quarter from an operational perspective. \n Yes, there are some easier comps when you look at the companion animal business, particularly in the U.S. We talked about those at length last year with the destocking and the timing of promotional activity, et cetera. But we also had some headwinds where we had strong comps across livestock, in particular, because of the timing of supply last year as well as the China market that we've been talking about we expected, as well in Argentina given the pricing impacts, et cetera, and then Australia and New Zealand. \n So when we take a look at those, we think there's probably 1 to 2 points of tailwind on a net basis is what we would estimate coming into the quarter. But then when you look at the bottom line, 15% operational growth in adjusted net income despite the royalty settlement that we had last year, again, is an offsetting element so we still end up with a sort of an operational growth that's in the same range that we've delivered. \n And so though it's still early in the year, we have confidence in the underlying market and demand that we see across our products. We're seeing increased periodic visits into the clinic for dermatology. Trio, despite head-to-head competition, had a phenomenal quarter, up 61% with $243 million of revenue with the U.S. leading that at 61% as well. \n So when we take all those into consideration -- and we're seeing price realization across the globe, including increased price from a hyperinflationary market like Argentina, so these gave us enough confidence to be able to raise the guidance and still be very confident in delivering the revised guidance that we did today. \n Now in terms of margins, let me just make sure I give you -- cover that. If you look at the headline, right, the gross margins are down about 10 basis points. FX had about nearly 200 basis point headwind in this. I think it's important to remind everyone there was a significant devaluation in Argentina that occurred 2 times last year, right? In December as well as prior to that in August. \n The December devaluation is actually in our first quarter. Keep in mind, our International operations close their books a month earlier. So December is actually Q1. So you're seeing the impact of that Argentina devaluation play out, particularly as you look at inventories and the effects on COGS, cost of goods sold, as well as lower in the P&L. \n And so when you factor those out, we actually had about a 200 basis point expansion operationally in our gross margins, which again aided our way into the expansion of adjusted net income and growing that at 15%. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. \nJonathan Block: I guess I'll ask both upfront as well. Wetteny, I'm getting a lot of questions on Argentina, so hope this is clear. The strength of the top line was big. You raised the guide revenue by 150 bps for the year. You mentioned 200 bps of year-over-year growth in the quarter from Argentina, if I have that right. \n But what is the incremental growth contribution from Argentina for the year? I do think everyone is like trying to figure out what the raise is, call it, like ex Argentina due to that market's hyperinflationary environment. I hope that's clear. Let me know if it's not. \n And then maybe just to shift gears, Kristin, on Librela, very helpful comments on the April run rate. And [ I'll recheck ], we hear about a safe drug that might have some issues in dogs with neurological issues and so just would love your thoughts on that. And does the company plan to do any, call it, follow-up studies maybe addressing select AEs, that would be great. \nWetteny Joseph: I'll take the Argentina question first and then Kristin will cover Librela. Look, the way I look at it, as we said in the prepared commentary and you quoted here, there's a 200 basis point contribution to the top line from Argentina in the quarter. And so if I were to say, look, we're still early in the year and we'll continue to look to take price in that market. And we'll have to watch how that plays out between price and volume as we go. It's a hyperinflationary market. We're pegging what we're looking at based on the actuals and what we anticipate. But again, it's still early in the year. \n So if you were to take this 200 basis points and you spread them for the year, in effect, you could say there's 50 basis points contribution to the year, if I don't account for any more price from here on, right? And so that's kind of how you look at it. And you'd say, well, the other 100 basis points in the raise is from the rest of the underlying business. The answer is somewhere between there, right? But certainly, contribution from the growth we're seeing, which we said is above our expectations for our derm franchise delivering $360 million, growing 25% on the quarter, as well as Trio, which continues to perform really well for us. \n And so those, I would say, are significant contributors to the top line guide that we gave. So we're increasing the top line by 150 basis points in terms of the range of operational growth. And Argentina is a piece of that, but I would say there is a significant contribution from the underlying business as well. \nKristin Peck: Sure, Jon. And I'll take the second part of your question on Librela. I mean, first, I really want to underscore that we have the utmost confidence in the safety and efficacy of Librela. It has been used for over 3 years across the globe in over 14 million dogs and it's approved in over 50 countries. And if you overall look at the rate of reported adverse events, it's about 18% per 10,000 or 0.18% globally. And I think it's important to keep in mind that no single adverse event is classified under the EMEA guidelines as more than rare, which is more than 1 to 10 out of 10,000. \n So we remain very confident in the safety and efficacy of this product. We watch these reported adverse events very carefully. It's an important part of what every pharmaceutical company does to make sure that we understand any trends that we're seeing. We remain very confident in the data. \n I really want to underscore, they've been on the market for 3 years. So we continue to watch the AEs that are coming in. And to be clear, the top adverse events today are, number one, lack of efficacy, so it's not working maybe as well as they wanted; polydipsia, which is frequent drinking; and the third being polyuria, which is frequent urination. So the other ones you're talking about remain a rare side effect. In other words, not more than 1 in 10,000. So hopefully, that answers your question. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. \nErin Wilson Wright: Great. Just another one on Librela, just given the stellar trends that you were mentioning, how do we think about the quarterly progression from here in the second quarter. And then also just like new patient starts, like how has that looked since kind of the media attention. \n And then on livestock and just a broader rationalization kind of the business with the selling of the feed additives business, which made sense. Do you see other opportunities to further prune the portfolio and presumably this lifts your long-term top line growth targets and margin profile just on the improved mix alone and the focus you can have on these higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. What does Zoetis look like in 3 to 5 years down the road because it could be potentially more skewed to that? And how do you think about that? \nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll let -- Wetteny, why don't you start with Librela performance and the questions you got there and then I can take the livestock question after that. Wetteny? \nWetteny Joseph: Yes, I'd be happy to. Look, we delivered $100 million of revenue in Q1 on Librela. That's 189% growth over the prior year. Clearly, the U.S. contributing $40 million is a big part of that. But we're very pleased with the performance across our International markets as well for Librela. And we saw a really strong sequential quarter growth across our International markets, and we continue to see the uptake. \n We're very pleased as well, when surveyed, European vet clinics actually indicating that now they're seeing more than 50% of the cases being moderate cases, which is very encouraging, as we continue to progress the product having been out there for 3 years. \n In terms of the progression for the year, clearly, we continue to ramp in the U.S. And as Kristin said and we said in the prepared commentary, as we look at -- on a rolling 4-week basis through the quarter and beyond the quarter into April, we continue to see steadily increasing orders of Librela as well, which again caused us to be able to be confident in our expectations for Librela as we look at the guidance that we gave as well. We're not going to get into very specific quarter-by-quarter. But I would say, if you look at the $40 million in Q1, there's very little to no stocking in that number. \n Now we did speak at length in February about the stocking in the initial launch in the fourth quarter. We had about 2.5 months at the end of the year for the product launch and you have to factor holidays as well into that. And we saw a very fast penetration into the 60-plus percent in clinics very quickly, which means that there's a lot more stocking in that. \n Now we give you a range of somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 of that being stocking, I would say it's likely in the high end of that range. So when you factor that into the $40 million this year, this is a really substantial sequential growth in Librela, and as we said, we continue to see momentum in the product. \n The one thing I would remind everyone is in International, we did have a number of markets that we launched in the second quarter last year. So we'll be lapping those across the international markets. Those included Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan and so we'll be lapping those. But we still continue to expect to see strong meaningful growth for the product as well as sequential growth as we go through the rest of the year is what I would remind you in terms of how we expect progression for Librela. \nKristin Peck: Sure. And Erin, I'll take your second question on livestock. As you and I have talked about many times, livestock generally historically in our industry has grown at around 2% to 4%. I know we grew less for a period of time when we were facing the LOE on DRAXXIN and with some [ large ] disease outbreak across the globe. \n But I think you're seeing is Zoetis over the last year and going into this year is we're turning more to those historic levels. I think as you look at this year, we expect to be above that level. Again, as Wetteny mentioned, Q1 is not a good indication if you look at sort of the comparable that we had there. So we remain very confident again in livestock. We believe we'll end at the higher end of that range. \n As you look at the divestiture of our medicated feed additive and water-soluble portfolio and assets, we've continued to be disciplined around our capital allocation. We divested our Pumpkin Pet care last year. This is something that, as a leadership team, we continue to do. We look at every asset we have. We want to make sure that we're investing in the highest areas of growth. So I think that actually is something that's just a rigorous part of how we manage the company. \n And I think as you look at livestock, obviously, the divestiture of the medicated feed additives portfolio will increase the overall growth of the company and the overall growth of livestock and also help overall on margins. But our real focus of the divestiture really had to do with doubling down and investing in what we see are great potential in the livestock industry and really playing to what are our core strength in preventatives, into antibiotic alternatives, into genetics as we think about vaccines and biologics and new genetic solutions. \n So again, we'll continue to look at our portfolio, as we always have and as we've done every year, but remain confident in livestock and -- especially this year in our ability to grow faster than the market. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. \nDavid Westenberg: Congrats on the quarter. So you gave a lot of commentary on April and Librela sales, and it sounds like there's week-on-week build. Just to confirm that is in [ fact ] clinic administration or end market that you're looking at versus like stocking or sales out from you. \n Veterinarians are really behind the product. It seems like there is some consumer social media kind of stuff. I just want to confirm that the DT sales advertising is on track or if there's any kind of changes there? \n And then just finally, if I could squeeze in just one more. In terms of your assumptions on that high single-digit in derm, what is the assumption in terms of competitive launch there? \nWetteny Joseph: Yes, David. Look, I'll take a stab at this and then Kristin may add some. First of all, when you look at Librela sales in the U.S., keep in mind, Librela is sold direct to clinics and the turnaround is very fast. And so there's no sort of channel dynamics to play out in terms of what we're seeing. What we're seeing from week to week is actually coming directly from what the clinics are ordering. \n And then look, DTC continues to be on track. As we said in our prepared commentary, part of the increase you see in our SG&A spend is really advertising and promotion behind our pain franchise, and clearly, Librela in the U.S. is a big part of that. \n And then when you think about derm, of course, very pleased with our performance here, $360 million, up 25%. Now there is some soft comp in that. But when we neutralize for that, we still see really, really strong underlying growth and strong demand. And we continue to be able to take price across derm. \n Now of course, it's still early in the year. So as we look at, particularly in the back half, we are factoring different scenarios around what's the timing of competition. And while we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our franchises post competition, as we're doing in Trio, there can be some near-term or short-term promotional activity that we are mindful, right? So we do factor those into our thinking in terms of how we land at the high single-digit range, which is up from what we said last time, which was mid- to high single digit. So clearly, our confidence continues to increase there. \nOperator: And our next question is coming from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. \n Okay. We will take our next question from Brandon Vazquez with William Blair. \nBrandon Vazquez: First, on Librela, I'll ask two upfront here. On Librela, can you guys talk about are you starting to see any pockets of that going from maybe the more severe OA dogs and being used in the moderate OA population? Anything you guys can do to kind of help push that market development because that seems to be the bigger opportunity as you -- as this grows over the coming years. \n Follow-up, second question is you're spending over $600 million in R&D now. I think we're about a year out from the nice Investor Day you guys held for us last year. Any meaningful updates in the pipeline that you guys can share with us, either new products or life cycle innovation, that might be coming in the near to medium term? \nKristin Peck: Sure. Wetteny, do you want to take the first one on Librela and I can take the R&D question? \nWetteny Joseph: Yes. I'd be happy to. Look, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Librela, as we said, both the U.S. and International. We did complete a recent survey of vet clinics across European markets. And after 3 years in the market, we are certainly seeing the transition to having a lot more moderate cases. In fact, vets, based on surveys, are saying more than 50% of the cases they're seeing now are moderate and even some mild cases coming into the mix. So that's very encouraging. \n And again, and that also contributed to an increase in months on therapy going somewhere between 7 and 8 months now is what we're estimating based on those surveys with vets. So that progression is what we count on and anticipate, and we're seeing that across International markets. \n We're still very early in the U.S. But that's the sort of progression we would expect. And we'll continue to educate vets on the product, as we've talked about, to continue to drive that as we move forward. Kristin? \nKristin Peck: Sure. And Brandon, to your second question on our R&D. Yes, you probably saw the strong growth in R&D in the quarter that is really because we remain very confident in our pipeline in many of the key areas that we mentioned at Investor Day, which was, I guess, a little less than a year ago, really investing behind some of the key therapeutic areas, both our long-lasting monoclonal antibodies, which will be some of the more near-term launches. We are not making any announcements on today's call, obviously, with regards to that. But that's going to be some of the more near-term launches. \n And then as we talked about, very excited as you look at renal, as you look at oncology and cardiovascular and diagnostics to continue to invest in those areas where we see huge potential. As you look at renal, cardiology, in oncology, we always said, as we said last year, those are more in the 4 years-plus range. So there's no near-term updates there. \n But we continue to launch products. As you look at -- as I spoke in my script about on Bonqat, which is around anxiety for cats, that's really important. It may not seem a huge product overall, but it's an unlock for the rest of our portfolio. If we can get cats to the clinic, we can sell more -- a lot of our other products, and more importantly, meet the needs of the cat population, which to date has very under-medicalized. \n So I know we don't give you all the visibility that you're dying for in R&D. But I think as you can see, we've continued to deliver on our pipeline and both in really innovative products, like what you're seeing Librela and Solensia, but also life cycle innovations that will really extend the life of important franchises such as some of our long-acting monoclonal antibodies, which should be more in the near term. \nOperator: Our next question is coming from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. \nChristopher LoBianco: This is Chris on for Steve Scala. We had two questions. First, on livestock, are you seeing any impacts on ongoing outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza? \n And then second on the U.S. companion animal market, what underlying trends are you seeing in U.S. pet adoption and abandonment rate? And are you seeing any change in share of wallet, share of consumer pet spend on medicines versus other product categories? \nKristin Peck: Thanks, Steve (sic) [ Chris ]. I'll try to take those, and Wetteny, certainly, if there's anything I missed, you can jump in. Look, we, like all of you, are continuing to watch the outbreak of H5N1. If you look at the portfolio that we have and our capabilities, we stand ready to support both governments and customers across the globe as they look at potential solutions to address H5N1, both on the vaccine side and on the diagnostics side. \n To date, we have not been requested to do that. But I think like many of our peer companies, we stand ready to support government authorities when that's needed. I do want to reassure people, I mean, data has come out that the milk is safe. Data came out from [ FISS ] this morning reassuring people that the meat base is safe. So we have not seen any impact to our business whatsoever with regards to this. \n This is a major issue for our customers. And our real focus is supporting them through this and making sure that we focus on what we can do certainly around biosecurity surveillance and detection, which we're more and more engaged with the U.S. FDA and others, given our diagnostics portfolio as well. So no, we have not seen any impacts to our business to date on that. \n Regards to the U.S. and looking at -- we have not seen a significant U.S. national increase in people bringing their pets back to shelters. I know there's been some isolated here and there, but as the overall U.S., that is not a trend. And those pets that they all adopted during COVID are all aging and continue to be drivers of our growth, not just in the U.S. globally. \n And I know there has been some talk around consumer sentiment and is that really changing. Obviously, we've seen some changes in sort of collars or treats and things like that. But what's really been clear and what we've talked about for a long time is when you think about animal health care, it's essential. They are not skipping on their animal health care. And if you look at the trends in the quarter as you look at increase in [indiscernible] visits, as Wetteny talked about, the reality is when their animal needs care, they are getting that care. And as you look at spend per visit in the U.S., we're seeing spend per visit up 6% in the U.S., which means, again, consumers and pet owners want to take care of their animals and they continue to invest in this. \n You look at the strength of the human-animal bond, this is another reason that we say animal health is a very resilient industry that people will continue to invest in the health of their pets, and that's certainly what we're seeing in the quarter. And as you saw, our expanded operational guidance for the year really being driven by our companion animal portfolio is what we expect for the year as well. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. \nNathan Rich: First, just a clarification on Argentina and the price increase. I guess, the price increase you referenced coincide with the December devaluation? It sounds like that price increase wasn't contemplated in the initial operational revenue range for the year. \n So I guess, like as we think about the impact going forward, I'd imagine that contribution should be similar over the balance of the year, I guess, assuming no major change in the currency dynamics in that market. So is that the correct way to think about it? \n And then on derm, the company decided to start selling Apoquel Chewable through distribution. Could you maybe just talk about the factors that led to that decision? And any impact on top line and margins for Apoquel as well as the broader portfolio as you think about the potential benefits of selling that portfolio through distribution. \nWetteny Joseph: I'll take the first one, Nathan, just on Argentina. Look, clearly, the devaluation occurred prior to us issuing guidance and we have plans and continue to see our ability to take price fairly significantly in that market perhaps beyond what we factored in. \n And so yes, we won't sit here and forecast what FX is going to do or what's going to happen in Argentina. It is a hyperinflationary market after all, so we'll continue to monitor that. And so we're only through one quarter here and we're all on our way through the second quarter, so we're factoring that into our thinking as well. And we are seeing an ability to continue to do that. But we can't sort of forecast, forecast for the rest of the year what will happen there. So we are a bit measured in how we treat that. \n I would say a portion, again, to what I said earlier, a portion of our increase is certainly coming from that. I would say somewhere between 1/3 to half of the increase we're giving in terms of operational guidance is coming from that because we are getting the operational lift from price there. And the rest of it coming from the rest of the underlying business, as we've talked about, is how I would think about that. \n In terms of derm, I'll start and then see if Kristin wants to add. Look, clearly, we have products in derm with Apoquel and Cytopoint, they've been in the market for over 10 years and 7 years, respectively. And the level of satisfaction on these products is very high among vets and pet owners. We've launched Apoquel Chewable as an important element because, one, there's a preference from pet owners and perhaps vets to have a palatable chewable. And so we see that as, one meeting, a need in the market as well as an important part of a defense strategy. \n And so as we anticipate competition in derm, we believe that competition will more likely be a film-coated tablet. And the conversion to Apoquel Chewable is important to us. We are seeing that conversion occur across international markets. In particular, if you look at Europe, we now have about 40% conversion to chewable after being in the market the last couple of years. So that's very encouraging. \n We just launched in the U.S. at the same time as we launch Librela. And so we want to look to potentially accelerate that transition in that conversion, hence, what went into the thinking here. \n And so it's still relatively early. There's only a little bit of contribution in the quarter here, perhaps out of the 25% growth you saw in key derm, there might be 2 points coming from that. And so we'll see some more of that occur in the second quarter, but it is an important part of our defense strategy. \nOperator: We will take our next question from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. \nBalaji Prasad: Apologies for missing my spot earlier and also in case my questions are a repeat. So on Librela, curious to understand how has your messaging changed, if at all, with the vets in how they use, how it reacts for dogs that they want to treat and what does this mean for the total addressable market, one. \n And two, can you help us understand the quarterly cadence for the rest of the year? I think the understanding before was that 1Q was expected to be the weakest quarter and second half stronger than 1H. On the back of this print, does this alter the quarterly cadence in any way? \nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll take your first question, Balaji, on Librela. And Wetteny, I expect you can take the second one on quarterly cadence. \n As we think about how we're approaching vets, vets are at the center of care. And our focus has always been around ensuring vets are educated on the product, that they understand it, that they understand how it should be used, when it should be used, et cetera. Certainly, since a lot of the social media, we've been more committed than ever to make sure that vets have better access to a lot of the education we've always been providing. And we've significantly increased our education with vets and their access. \n So things that we've done. We've done over 1,000 webinars. We have daily sessions with our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Richard Goldstein, to make sure they can have interactive sessions. We have an always-on customer support team. \n And I think, really, what you're seeing with regards to the vets and how they feel about the product is the confidence that they have access to the education that they need. And as you look at that, that is why you're seeing such a strongly positive experience, not just from pets, but from vets who really are confident in the product, as Wetteny mentioned, their confidence in prescribing the product more, their confidence in the safety and efficacy of the product. \n As we've talked about, we invest a lot in Zoetis in veterinary education, and we always have, and our vet operations in every market. So I think this is something that's been our strength. Clearly, with the social media, we have doubled down to ensure there's more access to this veterinary education to make sure that any vet who wants to understand more has access to experts, both internally as well as external KOLs, so they can best understand the product. \n And that again underscores our confidence in this product that we've talked about and the fact that we continue to believe this product will be -- this category, not just Librela, but Librela and Solensia, we continue to commit this will be a $1 billion franchise for Zoetis and that is really rooted in the safety and efficacy of this product and in investment we're putting into both vet and pet owners to make sure they understand the product. \nWetteny Joseph: Yes. And Balaji, in terms of quarterly cadence and I'll answer the question specific with respect to Librela. If you mean it for overall, I can certainly recap that conversation. \n But look, clearly, $40 million contribution in the first quarter. And keep in mind, we continue to see really strong growth across our international markets, which moved 71% on the quarter as well. So those will continue to drive growth for us. \n We won't get ultra-specific in terms of the exact contribution as the quarters go, but we would expect to continue to ramp up from that $40 million through the year. And then, of course, the fourth quarter in terms of percentage growth, we'll be lapping the $44 million that we delivered in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of launch. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Glen Santangelo with Jefferies. \nGlen Santangelo: Hey, Kristin, obviously, the outlook for Trio in derm continues to be encouraging here. But just given the recent launch of BI and the Elanco launches that presumably may be coming in the second half, if you could look out to 2025 for a second. I'm kind of curious if you anticipate any sort of noticeable shift in the competitive landscape or anything that you think might impact your ability to take price? \n And the reason I ask is some are getting concerned about increasing competition and a weakening consumer at the same time maybe would impact the company's ability to take price increases consistent with what you have done historically. So any sort of high-level commentary, I think, would be helpful. \nKristin Peck: Sure. I'll start and then, Wetteny, you can certainly build on this one. We remain very confident and it's really based on our historical performance, and I think you can look at that, we invest in the local innovation across our franchises. \n We were #5, let's be clear, guys, in paras when we entered with Simparica and Simparica Trio and we're now #2. We're facing competition from the leader in parasiticide, and we grew our share of 0.7% if you look at Q1 in the U.S. So even with very strong competition, we continue to grow share. So we remain confident we can continue to grow our parasiticides and our dermatology franchises even with competition. \n I mean, paras has always been a very competitive space with most companies operating there. We think our strength, obviously, with the vets, our strength with pet owners, really seeing tremendous growth in our franchises for both Trio and derm in alternative channels, in home delivery and retail. \n And we see great strength there as you look at the autoship. We continue to increase autoship out there, which absolutely increases compliance, which we think is really important. As you look at, for example, the alternative channels, they grew 55%. Now that was a little bit of a weaker comp if you look at last year. But even if you adjust for all that, that's 25%-plus growth in the alternative channel. \n So we really believe that we can continue to grow this franchise based on the strength of our products, the strength of our portfolio, our life cycle innovation if you look at what we're doing with Chewable, as well as leveraging some of these new channels, which have the benefit of increased compliance. \n So back again, it's our confidence not just for '24, but for '25. I don't know, Wetteny, if you want to add anything on that. \nWetteny Joseph: Look, the only thing I would say is two things. One, we are not seeing a weakening consumer. You saw us post high double-digit growth across Trio and our key derm franchise. And even if we normalize for some of the tailwinds from last year, we still have high double-digit growth across each of those. And so that certainly demonstrates continued demand products and our innovation. \n The other one I would say is, look, as we look ahead and we're not going to give guidance specific to 2025 here, but we're confident in our ability to grow in the face of competition. Now there can be some short-term promotional activity that might have some impact. But beyond those, we're confident in our products and we'll see what the labels are that we're going to compete against. \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott: Just two questions for me. Just continuing on Trio, can you quantify if there's a channel dynamic benefit you saw here? And just give us a little more color on maybe the size of that. \n And then the second one was Librela U.S. Should we expect a similar dynamic in the U.S. that we saw ex U.S., where initial uptake is more in the severe OA pets, which I think would be maybe a little bit less sensitive to some of the headlines we've seen over the past month and then the moderate piece of the business is happening kind of a year or 2 or further out? Or is the U.S. market you're thinking different where those severe and moderate may be scaling kind of simultaneously with each other? \nKristin Peck: Sure. Thanks, Chris. I'll let -- you take, Wetteny, the Trio question. I can follow up on Librela. \nWetteny Joseph: Yes, absolutely. Look, the short answer is no. There's no channel dynamics that we're seeing here. As I mentioned just a moment ago, we did have dynamics last year in the quarter where you saw destocking coming from promotional -- timing of promotions in the prior year and more prepriced buy-ups. And so that did provide some tailwind here. \n So we posted 61% growth globally, and that's the same percentage growth in the U.S., $205 million growing 61%. And if you were to say -- there's no precision here, but I would say our internal estimates is that if we factor in the tailwinds from last year, that may account for about half of the growth that we're seeing. \n So still remaining very significant growth on Trio, and there's no channel dynamics in terms of inventories to speak of in the current year. \nKristin Peck: Sure. And on your second question with regards to Librela in the U.S., I mean, what we have seen historically in Europe and in markets that launched first is it is often put into the severe dogs who are desperate for a new therapy initially and moving to the moderate. \n But we've learned that lesson after 3 years in Europe. And so we're making sure as we launch in the U.S. that we get into that moderate. As you think about the early Experience Trial, for example, that we did in the U.S., we made sure there was a balance of mild, moderate and more severe cases so that they have experience and they can see the impact of the product in that. \n As you even look at some of the data that Wetteny spoke about earlier, which is we have more than 50% of -- outside of the U.S. of patients right now in moderate -- mild to moderate cases, which I think is tremendous growth. And what you're seeing when you do that is also an increase in compliance. So compliance is now between 7 and 8 months, up from 6 to 7 months outside the U.S. \n So our goal as we were launching in the U.S. as we designed the early Experience Trial and as we market with vets is to make sure that this is a product that can be a first-line therapy for mild, moderate and severe cases and making sure that we can get that conversion into mild and moderate, similar to where we are in Europe, faster in the U.S. So that is certainly our focus as we think about growing that brand in the U.S. \nOperator: We'll take our final question from Navann Ty with BNP. \nNavann Ty Dietschi: Thanks for the color on Librela. I have some follow-ups. What is the early effect from the vet from your online education sessions? And how many of vets approximately did you reach out to so far? Also interested in your early dialogue with the FDA, if any? Is that just a common surveillance after a product launch so far? \nKristin Peck: Sure. Thank you. With regards to your first question on the vets we've reached out to, we've reached out to through our tech bulletins with letters directly from our Chief Medical Officer almost every vet in the U.S. -- any vet who's a customer of ours in the U.S. We think that, that's really critical. \n Any of those vets can join, for example, our open office hours with our Chief Medical Officer, Richard Goldstein. We've invited vets to these webinars and really working with our veterinary operations group in every area across the U.S. to make sure they have access not just to internal and external. So thousands of vets have attended these webinars to date. \n Again, this is something we normally do. Obviously, we put it -- it's had more urgency to make sure that we have more ways to engage with them, to make sure that the veterinarian's questions are answered. \n And as I think as you look at the fact that our 4-week trailing sales continue to accelerate, as Wetteny mentioned, is demonstration that vets still are getting the education they need to confidently prescribe this product appropriately there. \n And with regards to the questions with regards to our interactions with the FDA. As you know from covering us, those are regular conversations we have with the FDA all the time. That's a normal course of business for any company as you launch a new brand, as you expand that and sharing the information in the U.S. and having a dialogue around that, sharing the global information with them. So that's a usual course of what we would do as we launch a product, and honestly, even when the product's on the market for years. \n So we continue to be a usual course and collaborate with the FDA to make sure that they have all the information they need there. So there's nothing out of the ordinary there in the normal engagement with the FDA. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call to the speakers for any closing remarks. \nKristin Peck: Thank you. Look -- sorry, back to me. Thank you. Look, I really want to thank everyone for joining today. I want to reiterate that this was an outstanding performance this quarter. I really want to thank our colleagues for their commitment. And hopefully, you see our focus on creating shareholder value. I think it's a strong start as we look forward to continued momentum in 2024. \n We are customer obsessed from unrivaled R&D investment to expanded manufacturing capabilities to a world-class, purpose-driven colleagues. Everything that we do at Zoetis is aimed at anticipating and addressing what we believe are the most pressing needs in veterinary care even before they're widely recognized by many others. And our scientific breakthroughs have firmly established us as a trusted and preferred partner to our customers. And we will continue to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the capabilities that will support Zoetis' future growth. \n So we remain committed to the safety and efficacy of our products and of our industry-leading products because our treatments change lives. Based on our track record of performance, I think our customers agree as well. So thanks so much for joining us. We look forward to engaging throughout the quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kristin Peck",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call for 2024. \n Today, we reported outstanding first quarter results, underscored by steady demand for our products, a focused strategy and our purpose-driven colleagues. We delivered 12% operational revenue growth and grew adjusted net income 15% operationally in line with the tenet of our value proposition. \n Driven by the launch of our osteoarthritis pain franchise, the U.S. led the way with 16% growth and 8% operational growth internationally. More specifically, globally, Librela grew 189% operationally, including $40 million in sales in the U.S., in line with our expectations. \n The powerful human animal bond fueled demand for our companion animal portfolio with 20% growth operationally, while livestock declined 1% operationally. \n This quarter's results even amidst global uncertainty are a testament, once again, to the power of our diverse and durable portfolio across markets, species and therapeutic areas. It also highlights the continued rise and resilience of the animal health industry. \n Our purpose and performance are rooted in science, which has always been the great disruptor. And as animal health is increasingly essential for nutrition and companionship, caregivers demand even more high-quality innovation. That means we identify the most prevalent area of unmet veterinary needs and invest in, develop, manufacture and deliver life-changing products that customers have been waiting for. \n Take, for example, Librela and Solensia, our injectable monoclonal antibodies to treat OA pain in dogs and cats, which are helping millions of pets return to play. With more than 18 million doses distributed worldwide, we are providing long-lasting relief to animals, many of whom were previously undiagnosed or untreated due to limitations of NSAIDs. With nearly 40% of all dogs suffering from OA pain globally, we believe just 1/3 of those are being treated. So we're just scratching the surface of care. \n And cats are visiting the clinic more often. In fact, we're helping curb clinic fears with Bonqat, the first FDA-approved product to alleviate anxiety in cat, which means we're expanding care in a historically under-medicalized area of the market. \n We understand that social media is a form for convening, a place for pet owners to connect and to share, but we also have responsibility to empower our customers to make informed decisions grounded in science and data. \n We are unwavering in our commitment to rigorous safety and quality standards, which has earned us the trust and confidence of veterinarians worldwide. Backed by that commitment, Librela and Solensia are safe and effective. They are anchored in 10 years of science and have been used in Europe for more than 3 years. \n In the U.S., 78% of veterinarians who are at the center of care are very satisfied with Librela. This is driven by real-world experience and consistent with the feedback we hear in other markets. And our research indicates that 46% of vet globally will treat OA earlier and 65% will treat more dogs now that Librela is available. \n To accurately reaffirm the safety and efficacy of these therapies, we are doubling down, working directly with veterinarians who need these products, hosting live sessions with our Chief Medical Officer and expanding online education and training while deploying capital to expand our DTC strategy. \n And veterinarians continue to be confident in Librela as evidenced by a recent blind survey of U.S. vets confirming that perception, and intent to prescribe remain unchanged. \n We remain confident that OA pain could be our next $1 billion franchise because we are meeting the needs of an underserved market. We are growing by nearly every metric, including adoption, penetration, reorder rates, patient share and expanded utilization. And looking at our 4-week rolling average in the U.S., we're excited to report that sales steadily increased through April. Our performance speaks to the power of the human animal bond. Discerning pet owners want options, and they will work with their vets to find relief for their best friends. \n Beyond OA pain, Zoetis has been able to lead the market in other key categories because we deeply understand our customers' needs. This allows us to not only compete in existing markets, but again, to create entirely new ones. And science has created something completely unique to our industry, two $1 billion franchises. \n Our parasiticide portfolio expanded the total market based on deep customer insights. Before Simparica and Simparica Trio, we were #5 in this category. These innovations changed how we compete. Today, we are #2 and continue gaining share and growing the market even in the face of competition. \n Similarly, we were first to recognize that new therapies were needed to treat canine itch safely and effectively. That market foresight changed the treatment paradigm and revolutionized pet care. A decade of dermatology has led to 3 products; 20 major life cycle enhancements, including Cytopoint, the first ever animal health monoclonal antibody and the first chewable with Apoquel chew. \n From what was once believed to be just a $100 million market has grown to $1.4 billion because we know what our customers need. Today, more than 18 million dogs are treated for allergic itch and atopic dermatitis and another 13 million remain untreated globally. We built a $1 billion franchise and demonstrated the durability of our portfolio. And we will continue growing this franchise underpinned by strong brand equity, first-mover advantage, life cycle innovations and strong customer relationships. \n We've led in parasiticides, dermatology and now OA pain. And each time our innovations have created new categories in animal health, you've seen the total industry opportunity expand. \n Now moving to livestock. I'm sure you all saw the news this week on the announcement of our agreement with Phibro Animal Health to sell our global medicated feed additives and certain water-soluble product portfolios and related assets for $350 million. This deal is another great example of Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus investments in areas with the greatest growth potential and innovation that are aligned with our key capabilities. \n I'm confident that under Phibro's management, the global reach of these products will continue to expand to meet customer needs worldwide. We remain very committed to livestock and just sharpening our focus and our core innovative livestock growth areas, including preventative antibiotic alternatives and genetics. \n In summary, for more than 70 years, Zoetis has been leading the industry with our commitment to innovation. We've invested over $5 billion in R&D since our IPO, which has brought more than 300 product lines to the market. Science is and always has been the great disruptor and at the core of our success in delivering the innovations that veterinarians, livestock producers and pet owners expect from us. \n Our pursuit of science has led to breakthroughs in dermatology, like Cytopoint and Apoquel chew; in parasiticide with Simparica Trio; and now the latest in OA pain with Librela and Solensia that are revolutionizing animal health. \n Blazing new trails isn't easy. But time and again, our purpose-driven colleagues have proven their ability to expand our industry leadership and forge entirely new markets. \n And we remain committed to delivering strong growth through our innovative franchises and diverse portfolio while continuing to invest for the future. \n Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024, our increased operational guidance reflects the resilience of the animal health market and the execution of our strategic growth priorities. We will continue to be disciplined, yet adaptable in our approach to the opportunities, potential challenges and economic shifts that occurred throughout the year. \n And with that, I will turn it over to Wetteny. Sure, Jon. And I'll take the second part of your question on Librela. I mean, first, I really want to underscore that we have the utmost confidence in the safety and efficacy of Librela. It has been used for over 3 years across the globe in over 14 million dogs and it's approved in over 50 countries. And if you overall look at the rate of reported adverse events, it's about 18% per 10,000 or 0.18% globally. And I think it's important to keep in mind that no single adverse event is classified under the EMEA guidelines as more than rare, which is more than 1 to 10 out of 10,000. \n So we remain very confident in the safety and efficacy of this product. We watch these reported adverse events very carefully. It's an important part of what every pharmaceutical company does to make sure that we understand any trends that we're seeing. We remain very confident in the data. \n I really want to underscore, they've been on the market for 3 years. So we continue to watch the AEs that are coming in. And to be clear, the top adverse events today are, number one, lack of efficacy, so it's not working maybe as well as they wanted; polydipsia, which is frequent drinking; and the third being polyuria, which is frequent urination. So the other ones you're talking about remain a rare side effect. In other words, not more than 1 in 10,000. So hopefully, that answers your question. Sure. I'll let -- Wetteny, why don't you start with Librela performance and the questions you got there and then I can take the livestock question after that. Wetteny? Sure. And Erin, I'll take your second question on livestock. As you and I have talked about many times, livestock generally historically in our industry has grown at around 2% to 4%. I know we grew less for a period of time when we were facing the LOE on DRAXXIN and with some [ large ] disease outbreak across the globe. \n But I think you're seeing is Zoetis over the last year and going into this year is we're turning more to those historic levels. I think as you look at this year, we expect to be above that level. Again, as Wetteny mentioned, Q1 is not a good indication if you look at sort of the comparable that we had there. So we remain very confident again in livestock. We believe we'll end at the higher end of that range. \n As you look at the divestiture of our medicated feed additive and water-soluble portfolio and assets, we've continued to be disciplined around our capital allocation. We divested our Pumpkin Pet care last year. This is something that, as a leadership team, we continue to do. We look at every asset we have. We want to make sure that we're investing in the highest areas of growth. So I think that actually is something that's just a rigorous part of how we manage the company. \n And I think as you look at livestock, obviously, the divestiture of the medicated feed additives portfolio will increase the overall growth of the company and the overall growth of livestock and also help overall on margins. But our real focus of the divestiture really had to do with doubling down and investing in what we see are great potential in the livestock industry and really playing to what are our core strength in preventatives, into antibiotic alternatives, into genetics as we think about vaccines and biologics and new genetic solutions. \n So again, we'll continue to look at our portfolio, as we always have and as we've done every year, but remain confident in livestock and -- especially this year in our ability to grow faster than the market. Sure. Wetteny, do you want to take the first one on Librela and I can take the R&D question? Sure. And Brandon, to your second question on our R&D. Yes, you probably saw the strong growth in R&D in the quarter that is really because we remain very confident in our pipeline in many of the key areas that we mentioned at Investor Day, which was, I guess, a little less than a year ago, really investing behind some of the key therapeutic areas, both our long-lasting monoclonal antibodies, which will be some of the more near-term launches. We are not making any announcements on today's call, obviously, with regards to that. But that's going to be some of the more near-term launches. \n And then as we talked about, very excited as you look at renal, as you look at oncology and cardiovascular and diagnostics to continue to invest in those areas where we see huge potential. As you look at renal, cardiology, in oncology, we always said, as we said last year, those are more in the 4 years-plus range. So there's no near-term updates there. \n But we continue to launch products. As you look at -- as I spoke in my script about on Bonqat, which is around anxiety for cats, that's really important. It may not seem a huge product overall, but it's an unlock for the rest of our portfolio. If we can get cats to the clinic, we can sell more -- a lot of our other products, and more importantly, meet the needs of the cat population, which to date has very under-medicalized. \n So I know we don't give you all the visibility that you're dying for in R&D. But I think as you can see, we've continued to deliver on our pipeline and both in really innovative products, like what you're seeing Librela and Solensia, but also life cycle innovations that will really extend the life of important franchises such as some of our long-acting monoclonal antibodies, which should be more in the near term. Thanks, Steve (sic) [ Chris ]. I'll try to take those, and Wetteny, certainly, if there's anything I missed, you can jump in. Look, we, like all of you, are continuing to watch the outbreak of H5N1. If you look at the portfolio that we have and our capabilities, we stand ready to support both governments and customers across the globe as they look at potential solutions to address H5N1, both on the vaccine side and on the diagnostics side. \n To date, we have not been requested to do that. But I think like many of our peer companies, we stand ready to support government authorities when that's needed. I do want to reassure people, I mean, data has come out that the milk is safe. Data came out from [ FISS ] this morning reassuring people that the meat base is safe. So we have not seen any impact to our business whatsoever with regards to this. \n This is a major issue for our customers. And our real focus is supporting them through this and making sure that we focus on what we can do certainly around biosecurity surveillance and detection, which we're more and more engaged with the U.S. FDA and others, given our diagnostics portfolio as well. So no, we have not seen any impacts to our business to date on that. \n Regards to the U.S. and looking at -- we have not seen a significant U.S. national increase in people bringing their pets back to shelters. I know there's been some isolated here and there, but as the overall U.S., that is not a trend. And those pets that they all adopted during COVID are all aging and continue to be drivers of our growth, not just in the U.S. globally. \n And I know there has been some talk around consumer sentiment and is that really changing. Obviously, we've seen some changes in sort of collars or treats and things like that. But what's really been clear and what we've talked about for a long time is when you think about animal health care, it's essential. They are not skipping on their animal health care. And if you look at the trends in the quarter as you look at increase in [indiscernible] visits, as Wetteny talked about, the reality is when their animal needs care, they are getting that care. And as you look at spend per visit in the U.S., we're seeing spend per visit up 6% in the U.S., which means, again, consumers and pet owners want to take care of their animals and they continue to invest in this. \n You look at the strength of the human-animal bond, this is another reason that we say animal health is a very resilient industry that people will continue to invest in the health of their pets, and that's certainly what we're seeing in the quarter. And as you saw, our expanded operational guidance for the year really being driven by our companion animal portfolio is what we expect for the year as well. Sure. I'll take your first question, Balaji, on Librela. And Wetteny, I expect you can take the second one on quarterly cadence. \n As we think about how we're approaching vets, vets are at the center of care. And our focus has always been around ensuring vets are educated on the product, that they understand it, that they understand how it should be used, when it should be used, et cetera. Certainly, since a lot of the social media, we've been more committed than ever to make sure that vets have better access to a lot of the education we've always been providing. And we've significantly increased our education with vets and their access. \n So things that we've done. We've done over 1,000 webinars. We have daily sessions with our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Richard Goldstein, to make sure they can have interactive sessions. We have an always-on customer support team. \n And I think, really, what you're seeing with regards to the vets and how they feel about the product is the confidence that they have access to the education that they need. And as you look at that, that is why you're seeing such a strongly positive experience, not just from pets, but from vets who really are confident in the product, as Wetteny mentioned, their confidence in prescribing the product more, their confidence in the safety and efficacy of the product. \n As we've talked about, we invest a lot in Zoetis in veterinary education, and we always have, and our vet operations in every market. So I think this is something that's been our strength. Clearly, with the social media, we have doubled down to ensure there's more access to this veterinary education to make sure that any vet who wants to understand more has access to experts, both internally as well as external KOLs, so they can best understand the product. \n And that again underscores our confidence in this product that we've talked about and the fact that we continue to believe this product will be -- this category, not just Librela, but Librela and Solensia, we continue to commit this will be a $1 billion franchise for Zoetis and that is really rooted in the safety and efficacy of this product and in investment we're putting into both vet and pet owners to make sure they understand the product. Sure. I'll start and then, Wetteny, you can certainly build on this one. We remain very confident and it's really based on our historical performance, and I think you can look at that, we invest in the local innovation across our franchises. \n We were #5, let's be clear, guys, in paras when we entered with Simparica and Simparica Trio and we're now #2. We're facing competition from the leader in parasiticide, and we grew our share of 0.7% if you look at Q1 in the U.S. So even with very strong competition, we continue to grow share. So we remain confident we can continue to grow our parasiticides and our dermatology franchises even with competition. \n I mean, paras has always been a very competitive space with most companies operating there. We think our strength, obviously, with the vets, our strength with pet owners, really seeing tremendous growth in our franchises for both Trio and derm in alternative channels, in home delivery and retail. \n And we see great strength there as you look at the autoship. We continue to increase autoship out there, which absolutely increases compliance, which we think is really important. As you look at, for example, the alternative channels, they grew 55%. Now that was a little bit of a weaker comp if you look at last year. But even if you adjust for all that, that's 25%-plus growth in the alternative channel. \n So we really believe that we can continue to grow this franchise based on the strength of our products, the strength of our portfolio, our life cycle innovation if you look at what we're doing with Chewable, as well as leveraging some of these new channels, which have the benefit of increased compliance. \n So back again, it's our confidence not just for '24, but for '25. I don't know, Wetteny, if you want to add anything on that. Sure. Thanks, Chris. I'll let -- you take, Wetteny, the Trio question. I can follow up on Librela. Sure. And on your second question with regards to Librela in the U.S., I mean, what we have seen historically in Europe and in markets that launched first is it is often put into the severe dogs who are desperate for a new therapy initially and moving to the moderate. \n But we've learned that lesson after 3 years in Europe. And so we're making sure as we launch in the U.S. that we get into that moderate. As you think about the early Experience Trial, for example, that we did in the U.S., we made sure there was a balance of mild, moderate and more severe cases so that they have experience and they can see the impact of the product in that. \n As you even look at some of the data that Wetteny spoke about earlier, which is we have more than 50% of -- outside of the U.S. of patients right now in moderate -- mild to moderate cases, which I think is tremendous growth. And what you're seeing when you do that is also an increase in compliance. So compliance is now between 7 and 8 months, up from 6 to 7 months outside the U.S. \n So our goal as we were launching in the U.S. as we designed the early Experience Trial and as we market with vets is to make sure that this is a product that can be a first-line therapy for mild, moderate and severe cases and making sure that we can get that conversion into mild and moderate, similar to where we are in Europe, faster in the U.S. So that is certainly our focus as we think about growing that brand in the U.S. Sure. Thank you. With regards to your first question on the vets we've reached out to, we've reached out to through our tech bulletins with letters directly from our Chief Medical Officer almost every vet in the U.S. -- any vet who's a customer of ours in the U.S. We think that, that's really critical. \n Any of those vets can join, for example, our open office hours with our Chief Medical Officer, Richard Goldstein. We've invited vets to these webinars and really working with our veterinary operations group in every area across the U.S. to make sure they have access not just to internal and external. So thousands of vets have attended these webinars to date. \n Again, this is something we normally do. Obviously, we put it -- it's had more urgency to make sure that we have more ways to engage with them, to make sure that the veterinarian's questions are answered. \n And as I think as you look at the fact that our 4-week trailing sales continue to accelerate, as Wetteny mentioned, is demonstration that vets still are getting the education they need to confidently prescribe this product appropriately there. \n And with regards to the questions with regards to our interactions with the FDA. As you know from covering us, those are regular conversations we have with the FDA all the time. That's a normal course of business for any company as you launch a new brand, as you expand that and sharing the information in the U.S. and having a dialogue around that, sharing the global information with them. So that's a usual course of what we would do as we launch a product, and honestly, even when the product's on the market for years. \n So we continue to be a usual course and collaborate with the FDA to make sure that they have all the information they need there. So there's nothing out of the ordinary there in the normal engagement with the FDA. Thank you. Look -- sorry, back to me. Thank you. Look, I really want to thank everyone for joining today. I want to reiterate that this was an outstanding performance this quarter. I really want to thank our colleagues for their commitment. And hopefully, you see our focus on creating shareholder value. I think it's a strong start as we look forward to continued momentum in 2024. \n We are customer obsessed from unrivaled R&D investment to expanded manufacturing capabilities to a world-class, purpose-driven colleagues. Everything that we do at Zoetis is aimed at anticipating and addressing what we believe are the most pressing needs in veterinary care even before they're widely recognized by many others. And our scientific breakthroughs have firmly established us as a trusted and preferred partner to our customers. And we will continue to invest in the talent, the pipeline and the capabilities that will support Zoetis' future growth. \n So we remain committed to the safety and efficacy of our products and of our industry-leading products because our treatments change lives. Based on our track record of performance, I think our customers agree as well. So thanks so much for joining us. We look forward to engaging throughout the quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Kristin mentioned, we had an outstanding start to the year driven by the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, particularly our innovative products, as well as price growth across all species. \n In the first quarter, we generated revenue of $2.2 billion, growing 10% on a reported basis and 12% on an operational basis. \n Adjusted net income of $634 million grew 4% on a reported basis and 15% on an operational basis. \n Our 12% operational revenue growth was due to the underlying strength of our companion animal portfolio, aided by the impact of a weak comparative quarter in our U.S. companion animal business. However, the majority of this [ probability ] to growth was offset by headwinds related to economic conditions in China, the impact of a tough comparative quarter in livestock due to the timing of supply for certain products last year and inventory destocking related to our U.S. diagnostics sales model change. \n Of the 12% operational revenue growth, 7% is from price with 5% growth in volume. While we saw price growth across our portfolio, price was favorably impacted by hyperinflationary markets, especially Argentina, which contributed 2% to our overall price growth. \n The volume growth was driven primarily by new products, including our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, Librela and Solensia, as well as our key dermatology products and Simparica Trio. \n On a segment basis, the U.S. posted $1.2 billion in revenue, growing 16% on the quarter, while our International segment reported revenue of $1 billion with operational growth of 8% in the quarter. \n Our companion animal portfolio was the main driver of revenue growth in Q1, growing 20% operationally. This growth was partially offset by livestock, which declined 1% on an operational basis. \n We saw double-digit operational companion animal growth in both our U.S. and our International segments again this quarter, driven by the strong performance of our innovative products with contributions from both volume and price. \n Simparica Trio was the primary driver of growth in the quarter, generating $243 million globally, representing operational growth of 61%. We saw strong demand for Trio as well as continued growth in patient share even with competition. \n Our OA pain meds were also a significant contributor to growth, posting $131 million in the quarter. Global growth came from the impact of new launch markets, both in the U.S. and internationally. In our early launch EU markets, recent vet surveys showed an increase in muscle on therapy and expansion into more moderate OA cases. \n Our key dermatology products grew 25% operationally in the quarter with $360 million in global revenue. Growth within dermatology was driven primarily by our Apoquel franchise, where we are seeing solid conversion to Apoquel Chewable, including a modest impact from initial distributor stocking in the U.S. \n Cytopoint growth continues to be driven by vet and pet owner preference for injectable methods of treatment. \n Our global companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 12% operationally with declines in the U.S. driven by our distribution model change. These declines were anticipated as our distribution partners sold off their remaining inventory due to our transition to a direct-only model for our U.S. diagnostics portfolio. U.S. declines were partially offset by growth internationally. \n Our livestock portfolio declined 1% operationally, as expected, driven by a tough comparative quarter in the prior year especially in the U.S. as well as impacts from the ongoing economic conditions in China. This decline was partially offset by price growth in our other International markets. \n Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, growing 16% with companion animal growth of 25% and livestock posting a 7% decline. The companion animal performance in the quarter was driven by Simparica Trio, our key dermatology portfolio, and the impact of the launch of Librela in the U.S. as well as the impact of a weak comparative quarter. \n Our outstanding U.S. companion animal growth came in the quarter where we saw vet clinic visits decrease 1.5%. We continued to see growth in the therapeutic visits while wellness visits drove the decline. \n Sales outgrowth in the retail and home delivery continued to outpace vet clinic fulfillment, which is based on growing pet owner preference for these alternative channels. This dynamic is expected to put continued pressure on total vet clinic visits without impacting our expectations for revenue. \n Despite the visit decline, revenue and spend per visit in the clinic grew 4.5% and 6%, respectively, which reflects continued pet owner willingness to pay. \n Turning to product performance. Simparica Trio posted sales of $205 million in the quarter, growing 61%. We continue to be the market leader in the triple-combination parasiticide space. Our leading footprint across channels has allowed us to continue to drive dosage growth through increased compliance even with declines in wellness visits at the clinic. \n In addition to a weak comparable period in the prior year, we are seeing favorable price realization due to more targeted discount programs to vets as well as channel dynamics. \n The dermatology product sales in the U.S. were $233 million for the quarter, growing 27%. We saw growth in both price and volume and across both Apoquel and Cytopoint. Both also benefited from a weak comparable period in the prior year. \n Market demand for our dermatology products remained high. In the quarter, we saw growth in both our patient share as well as higher periodic visits in the clinic. Additionally, growth of retail autoship programs continued to bolster compliance. At the beginning of April, we made Apoquel Chewable available through our distribution partners. \n Our pain meds, Librela and Solensia, posted a combined $57 million in U.S. sales in Q1. Librela generated $40 million in the quarter with underlying vet demand continuing to build on the momentum from our full launch in Q4 of last year. Excluding the impact of the initial clinic stocking, which we have provided last quarter, we are seeing robust sequential quarter growth in Librela, in line with expectations. \n We continued to see good growth in penetration as well as strong reorder rates, which are approaching 80%, all of which points to positive real-world satisfaction in the clinic and among pet owners. \n We remain confident not just in the safety and efficacy of Librela, but also in our expected performance. As Kristin alluded to, we have seen steady increasing trends in our trailing 4-week sales average in the U.S., even into April, after the increased media attention. \n We continued to see steady progress in Solensia, which had U.S. sales of $17 million in the quarter, more than doubling our prior year Q1 sales. We have indicated the feline market needs significant development, but we are pleased with our progress thus far. \n Solensia is now the market-leading product for feline OA pain in the U.S., and we have seen a significant increase in the medicalized patient pool since launch. \n Our U.S. companion animal diagnostics portfolio declined 21% in the quarter, driven primarily by distributor inventory work-downs following our channel strategy change. This destocking is in line with our expectations and has negligible impact on our underlying clinic demand. \n U.S. livestock declined 7% in the quarter while our underlying business performance in the quarter was as expected. Our results are reflective of a strong comparative period in Q1 of 2023, in which we grew 15% due to the return of supply on several products, primarily in cattle. \n Sales of swine products declined due to decreased sales of vaccines as well as JAKs. \n In poultry, we saw declines as a result of increased generic competition in our medicated feed additive products. \n Moving on to our International segment where revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal grew 14% operationally and livestock grew 2% operationally. Increased sales of our international companion animal products were driven by oral pain meds, key dermatology products, vaccines and small animal parasiticides. This growth was partially offset by impacts in China. \n Our International OA pain meds grew 67% operationally to $74 million in combined revenue in the quarter. International Librela sales were $l59 million, growing 71% operationally. Growth is balanced across new launch markets and our first wave EU markets. \n We continue to see evolution in the European markets, where we have seen expansion in Librela's use in moderate OA cases, which according to the latest vet surveys now represents the majority of the Librela patients in Europe. We remain pleased with the success of our DTC advertising campaigns in increasing pet owner awareness of OA. \n Solensia sales were $15 million internationally in the quarter, growing 54% on an operational basis. Our International key dermatology portfolio grew 23% operationally in the quarter, posting $127 million in sales. We saw double-digit operational growth across most of our major markets, driven by higher compliance and new patients. Growth was also favorably impacted by prepriced increased buy-ups in Japan and certain European markets. \n Our International small animal parasiticides portfolio grew 6% operationally driven by our Simparica franchise with Simparica Trio growing 58% operationally to $38 million in sales. Trio growth benefited from continued uptake in Europe driven by key account penetration and sales force effectiveness as well as contributions from Trio's launch in China. \n Simparica posted $56 million in revenue, growing 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. This growth was partially offset by a 29% operational decline in our Revolution franchise, which generates a high proportion of sales in China. \n International livestock grew 2% operationally in the quarter driven by price increases as in high inflationary markets. Price growth was partially offset by volume declines across all of our species, partially driven by a tough comparative period in the prior year due to the return of supply of certain livestock products. \n The volume declines in livestock were driven by cattle due to a tough comparable period related to supply and worsening market conditions in Australia. Our International swine portfolio saw volume declines driven by China, where we saw lower hog prices as well as a reduction in herd sizes. \n In sheep, we saw declines from herd reductions due to expected weather conditions in Australia and New Zealand as well as supply constraints on a key product. \n As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see economic challenges in China, where low consumer spending and higher urban unemployment have reduced spending. We are also seeing a slowdown in livestock with lower pork prices and smaller herd sizes. The impact on our growth is expected to moderate late in the year, but we expect to continue to see headwinds throughout the year across both companion animal and livestock. \n Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. Adjusted gross margins of 70.7% declined 10 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior year. \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 180 basis points on our reported adjusted gross margins. Excluding FX, we saw higher margins due to price increases, favorable mix and lower freight costs partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, especially in hyperinflationary markets. \n Adjusted operating expenses increased 11% operationally, driven primarily by SG&A growth of 10% operationally, mainly due to higher compensation-related expenses as well as increased advertising and promotion spend on our OA pain meds. \n R&D grew 13% on an operational basis, driven by higher project spend related to both recent acquisitions as well as advancements of our pipeline candidates. \n The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, a decrease of 80 basis points, primarily due to a higher benefit in the U.S. related to foreign-derived intangible income and a more favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. \n And finally, adjusted net income grew 15% operationally despite a $31 million headwind to growth from the nonrecurring benefit of our prior year royalty settlement. \n Adjusted diluted EPS grew 17% operationally for the quarter. \n Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $140 million. \n In the quarter, we repurchased $339 million of Zoetis shares. \n Before moving to guidance, I wanted to comment on our recent announcement to divest our medicated food additive portfolio and certain water-soluble products to Phibro Animal Health. This is a transaction that demonstrates Zoetis' disciplined capital allocation strategy to focus our investments on innovative solutions that advance animal health, productivity and sustainability. This divestiture will allow us to remain focused on other livestock solutions, including vaccine, biologic and genetic programs that are more aligned with our strategic priorities. \n Now moving on to guidance for full year 2024. As we have mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter that highlighted our ability to deliver through multiple sources of growth. Our performance in companion animal, especially in parasiticides and our key dermatology franchises, exceeded our expectations. Additionally, we continue to be pleased with the progress of the U.S. launch of Librela and are confident in our ability to meet expectations. \n We are, therefore, raising our 2024 operational guidance provided during February's earnings call. Note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late April. The updated foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our reported revenue guidance by approximately 2% and our reported adjusted net income guidance by approximately 4% when compared to our initial guidance issued in February. \n For the year, we expect revenue between $9.05 billion and $9.20 billion, representing a range of 8.5% to 10.5% operational growth. Our increase in operational growth is reflective of Argentina's pricing impact as well as due to performance in our companion animal parasiticides and key dermatology products. \n We now expect our full year operational growth for Simparica Trio to be double digit while we expect growth in our key dermatology products to be in the high single-digit range. \n As we stated earlier, we remain pleased with our U.S. launch of Librela. Our expectations for Librela for the year remain unchanged. \n Moving down the P&L. we now expect adjusted net income to be in the range of $2.62 billion to $2.67 billion, representing operational growth of 13% to 15%. \n And finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.71 to $5.81 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44. \n Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are very pleased with our start to the year. While our reported results are reflective of various foreign exchange-related headwinds, operationally, we continued to deliver growth across our key therapeutic areas and across most of our major markets. This growth highlights the diversity and dependability that allows us to continually outpace the animal health market. Additionally, we continue to lead the way, creating new markets and launching new innovation that increases the standard of medical care for animals. \n Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator? I'll be happy to take this, Mike. Look, we're very pleased with an outstanding quarter to start the year, clearly delivering 12% operational growth at revenue; 15% at adjusted net income from an operational perspective. Couldn't be more pleased with this. \n In terms of the guidance, of course, there are puts and takes, as you laid out. The performance in the quarter, when we think about the prior year comps, we think these are largely offsetting puts and takes that go into the performance. And I think that feeds into the later part of your question, which is how do we decide to go into increasing our guidance from an operational perspective. \n But when you look at the puts and takes, clearly the performance from our Trio and key derm, seeing growth as we continue to ramp the launch of Librela not only in the U.S., but across International markets gave us a lot of confidence in terms of underpinning the growth that you saw in the quarter from an operational perspective. \n Yes, there are some easier comps when you look at the companion animal business, particularly in the U.S. We talked about those at length last year with the destocking and the timing of promotional activity, et cetera. But we also had some headwinds where we had strong comps across livestock, in particular, because of the timing of supply last year as well as the China market that we've been talking about we expected, as well in Argentina given the pricing impacts, et cetera, and then Australia and New Zealand. \n So when we take a look at those, we think there's probably 1 to 2 points of tailwind on a net basis is what we would estimate coming into the quarter. But then when you look at the bottom line, 15% operational growth in adjusted net income despite the royalty settlement that we had last year, again, is an offsetting element so we still end up with a sort of an operational growth that's in the same range that we've delivered. \n And so though it's still early in the year, we have confidence in the underlying market and demand that we see across our products. We're seeing increased periodic visits into the clinic for dermatology. Trio, despite head-to-head competition, had a phenomenal quarter, up 61% with $243 million of revenue with the U.S. leading that at 61% as well. \n So when we take all those into consideration -- and we're seeing price realization across the globe, including increased price from a hyperinflationary market like Argentina, so these gave us enough confidence to be able to raise the guidance and still be very confident in delivering the revised guidance that we did today. \n Now in terms of margins, let me just make sure I give you -- cover that. If you look at the headline, right, the gross margins are down about 10 basis points. FX had about nearly 200 basis point headwind in this. I think it's important to remind everyone there was a significant devaluation in Argentina that occurred 2 times last year, right? In December as well as prior to that in August. \n The December devaluation is actually in our first quarter. Keep in mind, our International operations close their books a month earlier. So December is actually Q1. So you're seeing the impact of that Argentina devaluation play out, particularly as you look at inventories and the effects on COGS, cost of goods sold, as well as lower in the P&L. \n And so when you factor those out, we actually had about a 200 basis point expansion operationally in our gross margins, which again aided our way into the expansion of adjusted net income and growing that at 15%. I'll take the Argentina question first and then Kristin will cover Librela. Look, the way I look at it, as we said in the prepared commentary and you quoted here, there's a 200 basis point contribution to the top line from Argentina in the quarter. And so if I were to say, look, we're still early in the year and we'll continue to look to take price in that market. And we'll have to watch how that plays out between price and volume as we go. It's a hyperinflationary market. We're pegging what we're looking at based on the actuals and what we anticipate. But again, it's still early in the year. \n So if you were to take this 200 basis points and you spread them for the year, in effect, you could say there's 50 basis points contribution to the year, if I don't account for any more price from here on, right? And so that's kind of how you look at it. And you'd say, well, the other 100 basis points in the raise is from the rest of the underlying business. The answer is somewhere between there, right? But certainly, contribution from the growth we're seeing, which we said is above our expectations for our derm franchise delivering $360 million, growing 25% on the quarter, as well as Trio, which continues to perform really well for us. \n And so those, I would say, are significant contributors to the top line guide that we gave. So we're increasing the top line by 150 basis points in terms of the range of operational growth. And Argentina is a piece of that, but I would say there is a significant contribution from the underlying business as well. Yes, I'd be happy to. Look, we delivered $100 million of revenue in Q1 on Librela. That's 189% growth over the prior year. Clearly, the U.S. contributing $40 million is a big part of that. But we're very pleased with the performance across our International markets as well for Librela. And we saw a really strong sequential quarter growth across our International markets, and we continue to see the uptake. \n We're very pleased as well, when surveyed, European vet clinics actually indicating that now they're seeing more than 50% of the cases being moderate cases, which is very encouraging, as we continue to progress the product having been out there for 3 years. \n In terms of the progression for the year, clearly, we continue to ramp in the U.S. And as Kristin said and we said in the prepared commentary, as we look at -- on a rolling 4-week basis through the quarter and beyond the quarter into April, we continue to see steadily increasing orders of Librela as well, which again caused us to be able to be confident in our expectations for Librela as we look at the guidance that we gave as well. We're not going to get into very specific quarter-by-quarter. But I would say, if you look at the $40 million in Q1, there's very little to no stocking in that number. \n Now we did speak at length in February about the stocking in the initial launch in the fourth quarter. We had about 2.5 months at the end of the year for the product launch and you have to factor holidays as well into that. And we saw a very fast penetration into the 60-plus percent in clinics very quickly, which means that there's a lot more stocking in that. \n Now we give you a range of somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 of that being stocking, I would say it's likely in the high end of that range. So when you factor that into the $40 million this year, this is a really substantial sequential growth in Librela, and as we said, we continue to see momentum in the product. \n The one thing I would remind everyone is in International, we did have a number of markets that we launched in the second quarter last year. So we'll be lapping those across the international markets. Those included Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan and so we'll be lapping those. But we still continue to expect to see strong meaningful growth for the product as well as sequential growth as we go through the rest of the year is what I would remind you in terms of how we expect progression for Librela. Yes, David. Look, I'll take a stab at this and then Kristin may add some. First of all, when you look at Librela sales in the U.S., keep in mind, Librela is sold direct to clinics and the turnaround is very fast. And so there's no sort of channel dynamics to play out in terms of what we're seeing. What we're seeing from week to week is actually coming directly from what the clinics are ordering. \n And then look, DTC continues to be on track. As we said in our prepared commentary, part of the increase you see in our SG&A spend is really advertising and promotion behind our pain franchise, and clearly, Librela in the U.S. is a big part of that. \n And then when you think about derm, of course, very pleased with our performance here, $360 million, up 25%. Now there is some soft comp in that. But when we neutralize for that, we still see really, really strong underlying growth and strong demand. And we continue to be able to take price across derm. \n Now of course, it's still early in the year. So as we look at, particularly in the back half, we are factoring different scenarios around what's the timing of competition. And while we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our franchises post competition, as we're doing in Trio, there can be some near-term or short-term promotional activity that we are mindful, right? So we do factor those into our thinking in terms of how we land at the high single-digit range, which is up from what we said last time, which was mid- to high single digit. So clearly, our confidence continues to increase there. Yes. I'd be happy to. Look, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Librela, as we said, both the U.S. and International. We did complete a recent survey of vet clinics across European markets. And after 3 years in the market, we are certainly seeing the transition to having a lot more moderate cases. In fact, vets, based on surveys, are saying more than 50% of the cases they're seeing now are moderate and even some mild cases coming into the mix. So that's very encouraging. \n And again, and that also contributed to an increase in months on therapy going somewhere between 7 and 8 months now is what we're estimating based on those surveys with vets. So that progression is what we count on and anticipate, and we're seeing that across International markets. \n We're still very early in the U.S. But that's the sort of progression we would expect. And we'll continue to educate vets on the product, as we've talked about, to continue to drive that as we move forward. Kristin? I'll take the first one, Nathan, just on Argentina. Look, clearly, the devaluation occurred prior to us issuing guidance and we have plans and continue to see our ability to take price fairly significantly in that market perhaps beyond what we factored in. \n And so yes, we won't sit here and forecast what FX is going to do or what's going to happen in Argentina. It is a hyperinflationary market after all, so we'll continue to monitor that. And so we're only through one quarter here and we're all on our way through the second quarter, so we're factoring that into our thinking as well. And we are seeing an ability to continue to do that. But we can't sort of forecast, forecast for the rest of the year what will happen there. So we are a bit measured in how we treat that. \n I would say a portion, again, to what I said earlier, a portion of our increase is certainly coming from that. I would say somewhere between 1/3 to half of the increase we're giving in terms of operational guidance is coming from that because we are getting the operational lift from price there. And the rest of it coming from the rest of the underlying business, as we've talked about, is how I would think about that. \n In terms of derm, I'll start and then see if Kristin wants to add. Look, clearly, we have products in derm with Apoquel and Cytopoint, they've been in the market for over 10 years and 7 years, respectively. And the level of satisfaction on these products is very high among vets and pet owners. We've launched Apoquel Chewable as an important element because, one, there's a preference from pet owners and perhaps vets to have a palatable chewable. And so we see that as, one meeting, a need in the market as well as an important part of a defense strategy. \n And so as we anticipate competition in derm, we believe that competition will more likely be a film-coated tablet. And the conversion to Apoquel Chewable is important to us. We are seeing that conversion occur across international markets. In particular, if you look at Europe, we now have about 40% conversion to chewable after being in the market the last couple of years. So that's very encouraging. \n We just launched in the U.S. at the same time as we launch Librela. And so we want to look to potentially accelerate that transition in that conversion, hence, what went into the thinking here. \n And so it's still relatively early. There's only a little bit of contribution in the quarter here, perhaps out of the 25% growth you saw in key derm, there might be 2 points coming from that. And so we'll see some more of that occur in the second quarter, but it is an important part of our defense strategy. Yes. And Balaji, in terms of quarterly cadence and I'll answer the question specific with respect to Librela. If you mean it for overall, I can certainly recap that conversation. \n But look, clearly, $40 million contribution in the first quarter. And keep in mind, we continue to see really strong growth across our international markets, which moved 71% on the quarter as well. So those will continue to drive growth for us. \n We won't get ultra-specific in terms of the exact contribution as the quarters go, but we would expect to continue to ramp up from that $40 million through the year. And then, of course, the fourth quarter in terms of percentage growth, we'll be lapping the $44 million that we delivered in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of launch. Look, the only thing I would say is two things. One, we are not seeing a weakening consumer. You saw us post high double-digit growth across Trio and our key derm franchise. And even if we normalize for some of the tailwinds from last year, we still have high double-digit growth across each of those. And so that certainly demonstrates continued demand products and our innovation. \n The other one I would say is, look, as we look ahead and we're not going to give guidance specific to 2025 here, but we're confident in our ability to grow in the face of competition. Now there can be some short-term promotional activity that might have some impact. But beyond those, we're confident in our products and we'll see what the labels are that we're going to compete against. Yes, absolutely. Look, the short answer is no. There's no channel dynamics that we're seeing here. As I mentioned just a moment ago, we did have dynamics last year in the quarter where you saw destocking coming from promotional -- timing of promotions in the prior year and more prepriced buy-ups. And so that did provide some tailwind here. \n So we posted 61% growth globally, and that's the same percentage growth in the U.S., $205 million growing 61%. And if you were to say -- there's no precision here, but I would say our internal estimates is that if we factor in the tailwinds from last year, that may account for about half of the growth that we're seeing. \n So still remaining very significant growth on Trio, and there's no channel dynamics in terms of inventories to speak of in the current year."
