I'll be your moderator for MicroStrategy is 2020 Fourth Quarter Earnings Webinar. And before we proceed, I will read the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results were available in our earnings release and presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at www.microstrategy.com.\nMichael Saylor: Hi, this is Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy I'd like to welcome all of you here today to our webinar regarding our 2020 fourth quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to pass the floor to Phong who is going to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Michael. The fourth quarter was a good finish to what was an exciting and transformational year for MicroStrategy. Before I review our fourth quarter results in detail. I want to underscore the key highlights from 2020 for the company. First we had a solid sales year in light of the economic environment. Total revenue for the year was down only modestly and our performance in the second half of the year was notably strong. We also made important progress and our shift towards our cloud offering which drove current subscription billings to $15.5 million as of December 31, 2020 up 41% year-over-year. Second, we embrace the virtual wave to dramatically improve the cost structure and operating efficiency of the business. For the year, we reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 15% or $55.8 million and increased non-GAAP operating income of $68.2 million dollars from $9.2 million in 2019. Third, we deploy the excess capital on our balance sheet to generate substantial shareholder value. We return, a $123 million to shareholders via share repurchases and instituted the unique an innovative treasury reserve policy that made MicroStrategy the first publicly traded company to utilize bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve rights. Over the course of the year, we purchased 70,469 bitcoins for an aggregate price $1.125 billion or an average price $15,964 per bitcoin. As of 4:00 p.m. in January 27 our digital assets had a market value of $2.2 billion. Finally regarding our bitcoin strategy our pioneering decision to make bitcoin our primary study reserve asset has made MicroStrategy a thought leader in crypto currency market in generating great interest in MicroStrategy as a corporation.\nMichael Saylor: Thanks Phong. I'm really excited about 2021 looking forward if we think about the really exciting technology opportunities we have HyperIntelligence is really the cutting edge of MicroStrategy\u2019s business development strategy. HyperNow really represents giving people the power of HyperIntelligence out of the cloud in a multi-tenant environment in less than an hour. I think the HyperNow gives us scalable HyperIntelligence. If we can take all of the human labor out of the mix and all of the software downloads and installations of the mix then it\u2019s possible for a mid-sized company and Singapore on a Saturday afternoon to find our website sign up for HyperNow plug into our SaaS offering, integrate into one of their databases, plug in their enterprise security, build an application and deploy it out to thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of their employees. Customers and partners all not even on a week-day without talking anybody on the phone, without going into the office it's just really compelling. HyperIntelligence is not just compelling because we're going to be deploying it out of the cloud in 2021. It's also exciting because we've made a lot of nice upgrades to HyperIntelligence. For example, we provided HyperVision and you can see an example of HyperVision on our strategy.com website. But the idea is, I look at the documents and I lighted up in 10 different colors based upon the underlying metrics that the HyperIntelligence engine sees and codifies. So wouldn't it be great if I can read a list of one thousand names and see the ones in green that are making me money, the ones in red that are losing money and the ones in the yellow that I need to be focused on my see it in a split-second that's HyperVision. We made it possible to build these HyperVision applications and deploy them rapidly many cases less than half an hour. Our technology strategy is take 20 years of engineering of business intelligence that's industrial strength that was formally deployed on-premises or in single-user instances and to place that into a multi-tenant through SaaS offering take away the friction and make it possible for anyone honor of anytime to build these applications quickly and easily. So Hyper is part of it. The multi-tenant cloud is part of it another really cool part of it is the embedded aspect of our business intelligence offering. Everybody wants to embed intelligence into their apps into their websites with HyperIntelligence you can actually build a HyperCard application. If you're a big retailer, a big exchange and Amazon and eBay, what have you, you can build a HyperCard application. And then you could deploy it into your own website with just a few lines of code that you paste into website using our SDK, and what that means is we view the website with millions of users and you wanted to deploy HyperIntelligence on your website, without any download without any installation of an extension without any special authentication. You could build that app, you could deploy it on your website, you could deploy it out of our cloud subject to your security using our SDK in an hour on a Saturday that's really powerful embedding. We focused upon similar types of embedding technology to allow you to embed very, very deep analytics from MicroStrategy is platform or dossiers from MicroStrategy\u2019s platform. And I think the thing that makes us truly industrial strength in 2021 is the ability to spin up these cloud environments plug them into data and then embed them into applications that already have thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of users. So we're really excited about that. I'm excited about some other cool innovations we're working on. For example, the next version of HyperNow and HyperIntelligence has the ability to tweet and share to Twitter HyperCards. And so I think you're going to start to see more HyperCards floating around the Twitter sphere shortly. As always our business strategy is to innovate on the cutting edge to provide the most modern, the most enterprise grade platform that we can. And to be the industrial strength platform for intelligence for corporations that make their living off of extracting these insights and those corporations need to embed those into their own OEM offerings. We are running the virtual wave as you can see right now. And as I say to people and my own corporation all the time \u2013 in the era of the virtual wave, you can now so many words at speed of light and you can bend time and space. What are you going to do with that power? What it means to us is reach out to more of our customers more frequently more effectively. You're going to see that in full force next week with MicroStrategy World which is going to be our biggest marketing and education event in the history of the company. It's free to all, it used to be that our business was about, collecting 2,000 3,000 or 4,000 customers for a few days at some hotel in Vegas or Orlando or somewhere in Europe. And they had to take three, four, five days of their life to come. I estimate that probably between the expenses of MicroStrategy and the customer expenses it was a $10 million operation to stage a MicroStrategy World. This year we're going to have a MicroStrategy World event, which will be better and be more comfortable for our customers. We\u2019ll have dramatically more attendees. We\u2019ll spend an order of magnitude less money and they will spend almost no money. We are already in excess of 10,000 expected attendees, but that registration is building very, very rapidly as we approach the final date. That MicroStrategy World now we'll have more engaging sessions. We\u2019ll have solutions sessions. We\u2019ll be bringing together our customers that are working on common platforms everywhere in the world. We're doing some innovative things to make this easier for international customers in Europe, and Asia-Pacific to get involved. Of course we'll generate huge amounts of content that will be uploaded as on demand streaming content so that it continues to work for our customers in the coming 12 months. We've had the opportunity with that MicroStrategy World event to add a track call the bitcoin for corporation\u2019s summit. And that's very, very exciting for us as well I\u2019ll say more about that in a second. A few words on our capital allocation strategy as you know, we've been using bitcoin as our treasury reserve asset and we continue to believe that bitcoin serves as the best store of value and its very attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential to holding cash. Going forward, we're going to pursue two corporate strategies. One strategy is to grow our enterprise software business. The other strategy is to acquire more bitcoin, it is a bitcoin strategy that means we're not only holding our bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, but we'll also be seeking to actively acquire additional bitcoin as part of our overall corporate strategy. In the quarter, we did acquire bitcoin on three separate occasion or two separate occasions. We acquired $50 million worth of bitcoin at $19,227 a bitcoin on which we announced around the 4th of December. And around 21st of December, we announced we had acquired another $650 million worth of bitcoin at around $21,925 a bitcoin. And of course as Phong pointed out on the 22nd of January, we acquired more bitcoin $10 million worth of it at $31,808. Our view of bitcoin is, it is the technically superior digital asset in the world. It\u2019s a superior asset for storing value over the long-term. That means we expect capital to flow into this asset from other weaker assets or other assets that don't have the favorable technical characteristics of bitcoin. And in addition to bitcoin being a great digital asset and a great store of value bitcoin is also an open protocol for moving monetary energy. It is in essence the first digital monetary network having an engineered safe haven assets and also having it run on a digital monitoring network makes it an extraordinarily unique opportunity for our company. We intend to continue in our role as an innovator and as a market thought leader in the space. One thing we've done is prepared a bitcoin corporate playbook and we have gathered all of our documents related to governance, to accounting, to security, to technical protocols, to finance that we believe would be interesting to other corporations that wish to integrate bitcoin into their corporate strategy. And we're going to open source these documents and make them freely available to the world. We think it's good for the industry, we think it's good for us. And if you sign up for our bitcoin for corporation\u2019s summit next week, you'll be able to get early access to these documents. We will go beyond this to make other bitcoin education materials available to anyone in the world that's interested in them. We have done that up to now by placing many of these education materials on our hope.com domain. So if you ever want to know more about bitcoin just remember bitcoin is hope and type hope and you will go to our hope domain and you will see not only the ability to sign up for this conference. But also all of the other bitcoin materials we have gathered and curated. I continue to advocate the bitcoin standard and evangelize bitcoin as a solution to many problems that corporations and individual investors around the world face. We've had good success in our outreach. On YouTube I've got videos, some videos that have run 400,000 times certainly 2 million hours or more probably 2 million to 4 million hours of streaming video on YouTube that we've contributed. We believe this is good for bitcoin we believe it's good for MicroStrategy\u2019s brand. We believe that is going to help us to grow our enterprise software business as well as to pursue our bitcoin strategy. And so far we've seen lots of positive benefits from our educational initiatives, very, very good feedback from our employees. We're finding that we're able to attract and recruit employees more easily. We found it's good for employee retention and moral. We found it's also very good for our sales and marketing and outreach to corporations all over the world. When you are an enterprise software company, one of the most important things to do is always established relationships with Senior C-suite executives. And if they know your company and if they've heard your company and there are positive vibes in the marketplace around your brand that makes it easier for all of our executives and sales teams to meet with and engage with the customer. So we feel really good about the synergy between our software strategy and our bitcoin strategy and we'll continue with that. With regard to Bitcoin for corporations next week on the 3rd and 4th of February, we will host I expect it will be about 2,000 or more executives and officers, directors and advisors of corporations who are interested in figuring out how they might integrate bitcoin into their corporate strategy. And it's a hot topic because as the bitcoin monetary network grows, you\u2019ll see lots of examples of successes like Grayscale. Grayscale grew their assets by a factor of 10 in 12 months. You\u2019ll see successes like Square and PayPal, both of which have had extraordinary success by plugging their mobile apps into bitcoin. You\u2019ll see other companies like Genesis and ID who have an extraordinary success acting as prime brokers for bitcoin. You see companies like Fidelity they are having success offering, offering fund and brokerage and custodial services for bitcoin. The industry is really growing rapidly all the companies in the industry that have that have managed to integrate bitcoin into their strategy, either on their balance sheet as a treasury reserve asset or and their P&L are seeing extraordinary enthusiastic response from \u2013 market share gains and they're creating shareholder value. We're going to be sharing everything that we know about how to go about doing this. And in addition to laying out our methodology and sharing our experiences, we've also brought together 10 of the enterprise grade bitcoin vendors in this space. And either I or Phong will be interviewing the CEOs or the heads of institutional services and sales for each of these top 10 vendors in the space. So that if you wanted to come up to speed in a matter of 10 hours and jump start a process that would take you two or three months then you can do it in two days next week. And of course when we finish with our sessions next week, we will go ahead and upload those on demand to make those resources available to the industry going forward for the coming year. So to summarize, we're really enthusiastic about our enterprise software strategy HyperIntelligence. Our multi-tenant cloud and our embedded Intelligence in SDK capabilities give us a differentiated offering in the market we're best-in-class there. And I expect we'll continue to grow that business. We're very enthusiastic about our bitcoin strategy. We have a chance to be a leader in this marketplace and we're going to do our best to execute on that strategy and help other companies follow us in what we have done. And with that I want to thank everybody for your support and shareholders. And I will go ahead and pass the floor to Jeremy for Q&A.\nOperator:\nA - Jeremy Price: Thank you, Michael. We've got some good questions here and we'll start off with Michael. Michael, how do you envision the role of MicroStrategy participation in the bitcoin network evolving in the future and will the company look to build a software business that leverages the growth of bitcoin \u2013 the bitcoin monetary network will you expand the company go beyond being a leader for bitcoin treasury education?\nMichael Saylor: We have a strong team and we're actively studying the bitcoin industry and all the activities in the process in the industry and all the data in the industry to determine the best way for us to add value with our existing business intelligence and HyperIntelligence. Although we don't have anything that we are ready to announce, right now. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring our intelligence to the industry at the right time in the right fashion.\nJeremy Price: All right. Just as a reminder, please use the Q&A feature at the bottom of your zoom screen in order to ask questions. Next question for Phong, how should we think about the growth of license in 2021 given the momentum around cloud in subscription?\nPhong Le: Yes thanks, Jeremy. Obviously we're pretty excited about the ability to transition to the cloud. We are still early in that process. I think as I noted, we saw 21% growth in our cloud revenue on a year-over-year basis and 41% growth on our cloud billings on a year-over-year basis that was off of Q3 where we saw an 80% growth in cloud billings on a year-over-year basis. So, although early on we're starting to see good momentum. Obviously when we see subscription revenue come through it\u2019s recognized on a ratable basis so it ends up depressing slightly our product license revenue. And many people study cloud transition models and have experienced that. So if not for that cloud growth in Q4, we would have seen higher product license revenues. All that said, our revenue is generally speaking were flat from Q4, and flat for the full year. I think as we start to accelerate our growth in 2021 across perpetual licenses and cloud. My goal is to not see a significant change in our product license revenue, not a significant impact from our transition to cloud and see growth in both. And I think with the momentum that we see in our business that is a potential positive outcome its growth across all of our revenue segment.\nJeremy Price: Good, thank you, Phong. Next question and I think there are a couple of people who have asked this or some version of this. Are you planning to do another convertible debt offering or have you considered issuing equity debt or others securities to allow you to purchase more bitcoins?\nMichael Saylor: We're continuing and continuously evaluating our capital position, as well as the market conditions in the capital markets. We have sufficient liquidity to operate our business as it's currently conducted while it's possible to raise additional capital if we think it makes sense to, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any future financial plans.\nJeremy Price: Okay and I think a follow-up question there is, will you purchase additional bitcoins in future periods?\nMichael Saylor: Well bitcoin is an important part of our overall strategy. So going forward, we will continue to plan to hold our bitcoin we will invest additional excess cash flows in bitcoin. And we'll explore various approaches to acquire additional bitcoin as part of our general corporate strategy.\nJeremy Price: All right, thank you Michael. Let's see here. Are you a software company or just a bitcoin investment vehicle?\nMichael Saylor: We\u2019re a global leader enterprise analytics software and services. We continue to operate the software business as we have over the last 30 years. I mean, but at the same time bitcoins an important part of our strategy, we have a bitcoin strategy. In addition to our software strategies so if you just keep in mind that we've got two strategies we're going to pursue them both very enthusiastically. Then I think that's the best way to think about the company. We're going to grow our enterprise software business and we're going to acquire additional bitcoin on the balance sheet.\nJeremy Price: All right. This one is another bitcoin question, does your bitcoin strategy depend on selling high and buying back more bitcoin at lower prices?\nMichael Saylor: No, no, it doesn't. Our belief is that that bitcoin is the first effective digital monetary network and it's going to grow over time. We're early adopters. The early bitcoin holders are adopters. It's the solution to every company's problem and every individual investor\u2019s problem. And so, as more and more corporations adopt the bitcoin\u2019s standard and they use it as a store of value. As more investors and mutual funds and hedge funds use it as a store of value, as more individuals use it as a store of value, the overall amount of monetary energy, the total amount of capital flowing into the network is just going to increase in time. And because there's a fixed amount of Bitcoin, that just means the price is going to go up. And as I've said to many people, if you - the nature in the free market is in a free market capital flows from the weakest assets to the strongest assets. If you were in an economy that had a collapse in currency like Venezuela, and you had dollars and you had Venezuelan Bolivar. Well, the dollar is going to go up in value versus the Bolivar continuously and forever, as long as the one currency is weakening, the other is strengthening. And I think free capital markets were continuously adjusting as the capital flows to the place where you get the highest return. I think because Bitcoin is the technically superior asset, it's thermodynamically sound money, I think that more and more monetary energy or capital will flow into it. I think the price will continue.  And certainly, there's no reason why it shouldn't replace gold as a nonsovereign store of wealth, and gold is a $10 trillion asset class. So we don't try to time the market. We don't think there's any particular point at which you would ever trade out of the market. Bitcoin is a better safe haven asset than gold. If, in the future, God comes down and invent something better than Bitcoin and more money and more people adopted that, and that becomes bigger and stronger and better, and we see that, well, we'll share that with our shareholders. And we may incorporate that into our treasury reserve strategy. But right now, Bitcoin seems to be a dynamically strongest asset and a technically superior asset. So we just intend to progressively acquire more Bitcoin. And we'll probably do it at prices that are going up. I think when we acquired Bitcoin at $11,800, then we did it at $10,000 when it dipped down, and we did it at $19,000, then we did at $21,000, then we did it at $31,000. We're not really attempting to time the market. We're strategic buyers, and we're looking out a decade or longer, which we think is the right way to think about this.\nJeremy Price: All right. Thank you, Michael. I'm going to give a question to Phong here. I think Michael has been working too hard. From the time a CFO or a CEO of a publicly traded company mentally commits to buying Bitcoin for their company, to the time it confirms on the blockchain and is on their balance sheet, what's the average time frame for the whole process?\nPhong Le: Yes, it's a good question and something actually we'll be addressing in our Bitcoin for Corporations Summit next week. There's really no sort of straight answer or one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on how a publicly traded company might decide to invest in Bitcoin. If they decide to invest in a fund, it could be quite a bit faster. There are corporate governance issues and treasury issues that need to be worked through. If they decide to invest directly into Bitcoin on the exchange and through a custom solution, that could take longer as they identify the right platform, the right custodian or custodians, and the associated controls to it. So it literally can be done in a matter of weeks if somebody wanted to invest via a fund, and it could take months, as long as six or nine months depending on the corporate governance structure and how detailed the corporation wants to be in.\nJeremy Price: Thank you, Phong. Next question is, is MicroStrategy using a self-custody cold storage solution for the company Bitcoin holdings or are services of a third-party custodian being utilized?\nMichael Saylor: We can't comment on that for security reasons, unfortunately, but thanks for asking.\nJeremy Price: All right. We've got another cryptocurrency question. Are you interested in acquiring other cryptocurrencies or diversifying beyond Bitcoin?\nMichael Saylor: Is this for me or for Phong?\nPhong Le: I'll let you take that one, Mike.\nJeremy Price: This is for you, Mike.\nMichael Saylor: Yes. Our view is that Bitcoin is an institutional grade treasury reserve asset. It's 95% dominant as a proof of work crypto asset network. That makes it the crypto asset winner if the use case is money or long-term store of value, i.e., digital gold. So what we wanted with our treasury was, in essence, digital gold from the dominant monetary network in the world, the one that was most secure, the one that was most adopted by other institutional grade investors. And that would be Bitcoin. I think the other cryptos are investment theses. They are more like venture capital investments, and they have a different risk reward profile. And so we don't have a portion of our treasury allocated to venture capital, so it wouldn't be appropriate for us.\nJeremy Price: All right. Thank you, Michael. This one will be for Phong. When do you think your subscription revenue will become over 50% of total revenue? And would you agree that it's conservative to assume, based on the current product offering, your total revenue to grow, let's say, 7% to 9% CAGR during the next five years and generate over $500 million of free cash flow?\nPhong Le: Yes. So a lot of interesting questions in there. First, on our split of revenue, subscription revenue versus support revenue, I think it's probably the way you think about it. We're, right now, we have about $280 million in support revenue and $35 million in subscription revenue, so maybe 10% of total subscription. We are looking to aggressively change that mix shift, right, and move customers who are currently on-prem perpetual maintenance paying customers to subscription customers. We think it's a higher quality customer, a better level of engagement, and it's something that the whole organization that is working hard on. That said, not every customer is ready to move to the cloud, and we're not going to force them to move to the cloud. So like in 2019 when we had a big program to upgrade all our customers to our latest version of MicroStrategy, this year and going forward, we'll have a program to move our customers to what we call our enterprise cloud. And then over time, we'll have them move to our SaaS cloud. We think it's an important core part to the business. What is that pacing? I think we'll know a lot better after this year at what pace we can move because we're not forcing our customers and we'll move as fast as can with respect to our customers. As far as our growth levels, we've talked about a long-term plan, call it three to five years, where we think we can achieve 10% revenue growth. We talked about that in our Analyst Day. Now does that translate to 7% to 9% CAGR over the next five years? I don't think we can get quite that specific yet. But we think that range is not unreasonable. And as a result of that, we think we can see some more incremental cash flow generated from the business so that we can reinvest it for corporate purposes or into Bitcoin.\nJeremy Price: Thank you, Phong. And next question is, how are you hedging the volatility in the price of Bitcoin in your financial statements? If Bitcoin is being accounted for as an indefinitely lived intangible asset with annual impairment tests, will there not be a lot of volatility in the financials year-over-year?\nPhong Le: Yes. It's a good accounting question, but it's sort of the, I'll call it, book value of our Bitcoin versus what may be perceived as the market value of our Bitcoin. How we get to, based on the accounting of Bitcoin as an intangible asset, is every single quarter, we take each and every one of our wallets of Bitcoin and we look at the prevailing low price on our current exchange that we look at and we write-down or impair each of those wallets' stock price. And that's what's led to, I'll call it, sort of GAAP changes in our balance sheet that you saw in Q3 and Q4. And there is a - it creates a perceived disconnect between the book value and what one might interpret as the market value of our Bitcoin. What we've done is we provided non-GAAP financials that back out that impact in our financial statements and in our earnings report. And as a result, I think there's transparency into both means, the book value and a potential market value that someone can understand better. And I think the market understands that very well and it's very mature. So we don't really need to do any other, I'll call it, hedging of the volatility of our Bitcoin assets as a result.\nMichael Saylor: And if I could piggyback, Jeremy, we don't hedge the Bitcoin. I don't think it would be a good idea to hedge the Bitcoin. I think that the volatility comes hand-in-hand with the appreciation and the value of the Bitcoin. So it's a mistake to pursue any particular hedging strategy. We would be losing the alpha or the theoretical return on the Bitcoin over time. Our financing time frame is five years. We have five year convertible note. So we certainly don't look at the volatility over the course of a day, a week, a month or even a year. And over five years, we don't really have any financing against the Bitcoin itself marked to the value of the Bitcoin. The financing is just against the business in general. So I would characterize us as being very patient, long-term holders a Bitcoin, not overly concerned with near-term or even midterm volatility for that matter.\nJeremy Price: All right. Thank you both for those answers. And I'd like to thank everyone for submitting questions and participating in the call. I'm going to turn it back over to Michael for some closing remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Okay, Jeremy. I want to thank everybody that joined us today. For our shareholders on the call, thank you for your support. We look forward to speaking with you again in 12 weeks. And until then, all the best.",

            "content": "Hi, this is Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy I'd like to welcome all of you here today to our webinar regarding our 2020 fourth quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to pass the floor to Phong who is going to discuss our operational and financial results for the quarter. Thanks Phong. I'm really excited about 2021 looking forward if we think about the really exciting technology opportunities we have HyperIntelligence is really the cutting edge of MicroStrategy's business development strategy. HyperNow really represents giving people the power of HyperIntelligence out of the cloud in a multi-tenant environment in less than an hour. I think the HyperNow gives us scalable HyperIntelligence.

So we're really excited about that. I'm excited about some other cool innovations we're working on. For example, the next version of HyperNow and HyperIntelligence has the ability to tweet and share to Twitter HyperCards. And so I think you're going to start to see more HyperCards floating around the Twitter sphere shortly. As always our business strategy is to innovate on the cutting edge to provide the most modern, the most enterprise grade platform that we can. And to be the industrial strength platform for intelligence for corporations that make their living off of extracting these insights and those corporations need to embed those into their own OEM offerings. We are running the virtual wave as you can see right now. And as I say to people and my own corporation all the time \u2013 in the era of the virtual wave, you can now so many words at speed of light and you can bend time and space. What are you going to do with that power? What it means to us is reach out to more of our customers more frequently more effectively. You're going to see that in full force next week with MicroStrategy World which is going to be our biggest marketing and education event in the history of the company. It's free to all, it used to be that our business was about, collecting 2,000 3,000 or 4,000 customers for a few days at some hotel in Vegas or Orlando or somewhere in Europe. And they had to take three, four, five days of their life to come. I estimate that probably between the expenses of MicroStrategy and the customer expenses it was a $10 million operation to stage a MicroStrategy World. This year we're going to have a MicroStrategy World event, which will be better and be more comfortable for our customers. We'll have dramatically more attendees. We'll spend an order of magnitude less money and they will spend almost no money. We are already in excess of 10,000 expected attendees, but that registration is building very, very rapidly as we approach the final date. That MicroStrategy World now we'll have more engaging sessions. We'll have solutions sessions. We'll be bringing together our customers that are working on common platforms everywhere in the world. We're doing some innovative things to make this easier for international customers in Europe, and Asia-Pacific to get involved. Of course we'll generate huge amounts of content that will be uploaded as on demand streaming content so that it continues to work for our customers in the coming 12 months. We've had the opportunity with that MicroStrategy World event to add a track call the bitcoin for corporation's summit. And that's very, very exciting for us as well I'll say more about that in a second. A few words on our capital allocation strategy as you know, we've been using bitcoin as our treasury reserve asset and we continue to believe that bitcoin serves as the best store of value and its very attractive investment asset with more long-term appreciation potential to holding cash. Going forward, we're going to pursue two corporate strategies. One strategy is to grow our enterprise software business. The other strategy is to acquire more bitcoin, it is a bitcoin strategy that means we're not only holding our bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, but we'll also be seeking to actively acquire additional bitcoin as part of our overall corporate strategy. In the quarter, we did acquire bitcoin on three separate occasion or two separate occasions. We acquired $50 million worth of bitcoin at $19,227 a bitcoin on which we announced around the 4th of December. And around 21st of December, we announced we had acquired another $650 million worth of bitcoin at around $21,925 a bitcoin. And of course as Phong pointed out on the 22nd of January, we acquired more bitcoin $10 million worth of it at $31,808. Our view of bitcoin is, it is the technically superior digital asset in the world. It's a superior asset for storing value over the long-term. That means we expect capital to flow into this asset from other weaker assets or other assets that don't have the favorable technical characteristics of bitcoin. And in addition to bitcoin being a great digital asset and a great store of value bitcoin is also an open protocol for moving monetary energy. It is in essence the first digital monetary network having an engineered safe haven assets and also having it run on a digital monitoring network makes it an extraordinarily unique opportunity for our company. We intend to continue in our role as an innovator and as a market thought leader in the space. One thing we've done is prepared a bitcoin corporate playbook and we have gathered all of our documents related to governance, to accounting, to security, to technical protocols, to finance that we believe would be interesting to other corporations that wish to integrate bitcoin into their corporate strategy. And we're going to open source these documents and make them freely available to the world. We think it's good for the industry, we think it's good for us. And if you sign up for our bitcoin for corporation's summit next week, you'll be able to get early access to these documents. We will go beyond this to make other bitcoin education materials available to anyone in the world that's interested in them. We have done that up to now by placing many of these education materials on our hope.com domain. So if you ever want to know more about bitcoin just remember bitcoin is hope and type hope and you will go to our hope domain and you will see not only the ability to sign up for this conference. But also all of the other bitcoin materials we have gathered and curated. I continue to advocate the bitcoin standard and evangelize bitcoin as a solution to many problems that corporations and individual investors around the world face. We've had good success in our outreach. On YouTube I've got videos, some videos that have run 400,000 times certainly 2 million hours or more probably 2 million to 4 million hours of streaming video on YouTube that we've contributed. We believe this is good for bitcoin we believe it's good for MicroStrategy's brand. We believe that is going to help us to grow our enterprise software business as well as to pursue our bitcoin strategy. And so far we've seen lots of positive benefits from our educational initiatives, very, very good feedback from our employees. We're finding that we're able to attract and recruit employees more easily. We found it's good for employee retention and moral. We found it's also very good for our sales and marketing and outreach to corporations all over the world. When you are an enterprise software company, one of the most important things to do is always established relationships with Senior C-suite executives. And if they know your company and if they've heard your company and there are positive vibes in the marketplace around your brand that makes it easier for all of our executives and sales teams to meet with and engage with the customer. So we feel really good about the synergy between our software strategy and our bitcoin strategy and we'll continue with that. With regard to Bitcoin for corporations next week on the 3rd and 4th of February, we will host I expect it will be about 2,000 or more executives and officers, directors and advisors of corporations who are interested in figuring out how they might integrate bitcoin into their corporate strategy. And it's a hot topic because as the bitcoin monetary network grows, you'll see lots of examples of successes like Grayscale. Grayscale grew their assets by a factor of 10 in 12 months. You'll see successes like Square and PayPal, both of which have had extraordinary success by plugging their mobile apps into bitcoin. You'll see other companies like Genesis and ID who have an extraordinary success acting as prime brokers for bitcoin. You see companies like Fidelity they are having success offering, offering fund and brokerage and custodial services for bitcoin. The industry is really growing rapidly all the companies in the industry that have that have managed to integrate bitcoin into their strategy, either on their balance sheet as a treasury reserve asset or and their P&L are seeing extraordinary enthusiastic response from \u2013 market share gains and they're creating shareholder value. We're going to be sharing everything that we know about how to go about doing this. And in addition to laying out our methodology and sharing our experiences, we've also brought together 10 of the enterprise grade bitcoin vendors in this space. And either I or Phong will be interviewing the CEOs or the heads of institutional services and sales for each of these top 10 vendors in the space. So that if you wanted to come up to speed in a matter of 10 hours and jump start a process that would take you two or three months then you can do it in two days next week. And of course when we finish with our sessions next week, we will go ahead and upload those on demand to make those resources available to the industry going forward for the coming year. So to summarize, we're really enthusiastic about our enterprise software strategy HyperIntelligence. Our multi-tenant cloud and our embedded Intelligence in SDK capabilities give us a differentiated offering in the market we're best-in-class there. And I expect we'll continue to grow that business. We're very enthusiastic about our bitcoin strategy. We have a chance to be a leader in this marketplace and we're going to do our best to execute on that strategy and help other companies follow us in what we have done. And with that I want to thank everybody for your support and shareholders. And I will go ahead and pass the floor to Jeremy for Q&A. We have a strong team and we're actively studying the bitcoin industry and all the activities in the process in the industry and all the data in the industry to determine the best way for us to add value with our existing business intelligence and HyperIntelligence. Although we don't have anything that we are ready to announce, right now. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring our intelligence to the industry at the right time in the right fashion. We're continuing and continuously evaluating our capital position, as well as the market conditions in the capital markets. We have sufficient liquidity to operate our business as it's currently conducted while it's possible to raise additional capital if we think it makes sense to, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any future financial plans. Well bitcoin is an important part of our overall strategy. So going forward, we will continue to plan to hold our bitcoin we will invest additional excess cash flows in bitcoin. And we'll explore various approaches to acquire additional bitcoin as part of our general corporate strategy. We're a global leader enterprise analytics software and services. We continue to operate the software business as we have over the last 30 years. I mean, but at the same time bitcoins an important part of our strategy, we have a bitcoin strategy. In addition to our software strategies so if you just keep in mind that we've got two strategies we're going to pursue them both very enthusiastically. Then I think that's the best way to think about the company. We're going to grow our enterprise software business and we're going to acquire additional bitcoin on the balance sheet. No, no, it doesn't. Our belief is that that bitcoin is the first effective digital monetary network and it's going to grow over time. We're early adopters. The early bitcoin holders are adopters. It's the solution to every company's problem and every individual investor's problem. And so, as more and more corporations adopt the bitcoin's standard and they use it as a store of value. As more investors and mutual funds and hedge funds use it as a store of value, as more individuals use it as a store of value, the overall amount of monetary energy, the total amount of capital flowing into the network is just going to increase in time. And because there's a fixed amount of Bitcoin, that just means the price is going to go up. And as I've said to many people, if you - the nature in the free market is in a free market capital flows from the weakest assets to the strongest assets. If you were in an economy that had a collapse in currency like Venezuela, and you had dollars and you had Venezuelan Bolivar. Well, the dollar is going to go up in value versus the Bolivar continuously and forever, as long as the one currency is weakening, the other is strengthening. And I think free capital markets were continuously adjusting as the capital flows to the place where you get the highest return. I think because Bitcoin is the technically superior asset, it's thermodynamically sound money, I think that more and more monetary energy or capital will flow into it. I think the price will continue.  And certainly, there's no reason why it shouldn't replace gold as a nonsovereign store of wealth, and gold is a $10 trillion asset class. So we don't try to time the market. We don't think there's any particular point at which you would ever trade out of the market. Bitcoin is a better safe haven asset than gold. If, in the future, God comes down and invent something better than Bitcoin and more money and more people adopted that, and that becomes bigger and stronger and better, and we see that, well, we'll share that with our shareholders. And we may incorporate that into our treasury reserve strategy. But right now, Bitcoin seems to be a dynamically strongest asset and a technically superior asset. So we just intend to progressively acquire more Bitcoin. And we'll probably do it at prices that are going up. I think when we acquired Bitcoin at $11,800, then we did it at $10,000 when it dipped down, and we did it at $19,000, then we did at $21,000, then we did it at $31,000. We're not really attempting to time the market. We're strategic buyers, and we're looking out a decade or longer, which we think is the right way to think about this. We can't comment on that for security reasons, unfortunately, but thanks for asking. Is this for me or for Phong? Yes. Our view is that Bitcoin is an institutional grade treasury reserve asset. It's 95% dominant as a proof of work crypto asset network. That makes it the crypto asset winner if the use case is money or long-term store of value, i.e., digital gold. So what we wanted with our treasury was, in essence, digital gold from the dominant monetary network in the world, the one that was most secure, the one that was most adopted by other institutional grade investors. And that would be Bitcoin. I think the other cryptos are investment theses. They are more like venture capital investments, and they have a different risk reward profile. And so we don't have a portion of our treasury allocated to venture capital, so it wouldn't be appropriate for us. And if I could piggyback, Jeremy, we don't hedge the Bitcoin. I don't think it would be a good idea to hedge the Bitcoin. I think that the volatility comes hand-in-hand with the appreciation and the value of the Bitcoin. So it's a mistake to pursue any particular hedging strategy. We would be losing the alpha or the theoretical return on the Bitcoin over time. Our financing time frame is five years. We have five year convertible note. So we certainly don't look at the volatility over the course of a day, a week, a month or even a year. And over five years, we don't really have any financing against the Bitcoin itself marked to the value of the Bitcoin. The financing is just against the business in general. So I would characterize us as being very patient, long-term holders a Bitcoin, not overly concerned with near-term or even midterm volatility for that matter. Okay, Jeremy. I want to thank everybody that joined us today. For our shareholders on the call, thank you for your support. We look forward to speaking with you again in 12 weeks. And until then, all the best."

            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Michael. The fourth quarter was a good finish to what was an exciting and transformational year for MicroStrategy. Before I review our fourth quarter results in detail. I want to underscore the key highlights from 2020 for the company. First we had a solid sales year in light of the economic environment. Total revenue for the year was down only modestly and our performance in the second half of the year was notably strong. We also made important progress and our shift towards our cloud offering which drove current subscription billings to $15.5 million as of December 31, 2020 up 41% year-over-year. Second, we embrace the virtual wave to dramatically improve the cost structure and operating efficiency of the business. For the year, we reduced non-GAAP operating expenses by 15% or $55.8 million and increased non-GAAP operating income of $68.2 million dollars from $9.2 million in 2019. Third, we deploy the excess capital on our balance sheet to generate substantial shareholder value. We return, a $123 million to shareholders via share repurchases and instituted the unique an innovative treasury reserve policy that made MicroStrategy the first publicly traded company to utilize bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve rights. Over the course of the year, we purchased 70,469 bitcoins for an aggregate price $1.125 billion or an average price $15,964 per bitcoin. As of 4:00 p.m. in January 27 our digital assets had a market value of $2.2 billion. Finally regarding our bitcoin strategy our pioneering decision to make bitcoin our primary study reserve asset has made MicroStrategy a thought leader in crypto currency market in generating great interest in MicroStrategy as a corporation. Yes thanks, Jeremy. Obviously we're pretty excited about the ability to transition to the cloud. We are still early in that process. I think as I noted, we saw 21% growth in our cloud revenue on a year-over-year basis and 41% growth on our cloud billings on a year-over-year basis that was off of Q3 where we saw an 80% growth in cloud billings on a year-over-year basis. So, although early on we're starting to see good momentum. Obviously when we see subscription revenue come through it's recognized on a ratable basis so it ends up depressing slightly our product license revenue. And many people study cloud transition models and have experienced that. So if not for that cloud growth in Q4, we would have seen higher product license revenues. All that said, our revenue is generally speaking were flat from Q4, and flat for the full year. I think as we start to accelerate our growth in 2021 across perpetual licenses and cloud. My goal is to not see a significant change in our product license revenue, not a significant impact from our transition to cloud and see growth in both. And I think with the momentum that we see in our business that is a potential positive outcome its growth across all of our revenue segment. Yes, it's a good question and something actually we'll be addressing in our Bitcoin for Corporations Summit next week. There's really no sort of straight answer or one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on how a publicly traded company might decide to invest in Bitcoin. If they decide to invest in a fund, it could be quite a bit faster. There are corporate governance issues and treasury issues that need to be worked through. If they decide to invest directly into Bitcoin on the exchange and through a custom solution, that could take longer as they identify the right platform, the right custodian or custodians, and the associated controls to it. So it literally can be done in a matter of weeks if somebody wanted to invest via a fund, and it could take months, as long as six or nine months depending on the corporate governance structure and how detailed the corporation wants to be in. I'll let you take that one, Mike. Yes. So a lot of interesting questions in there. First, on our split of revenue, subscription revenue versus support revenue, I think it's probably the way you think about it. We're, right now, we have about $280 million in support revenue and $35 million in subscription revenue, so maybe 10% of total subscription. We are looking to aggressively change that mix shift, right, and move customers who are currently on-prem perpetual maintenance paying customers to subscription customers. We think it's a higher quality customer, a better level of engagement, and it's something that the whole organization that is working hard on. That said, not every customer is ready to move to the cloud, and we're not going to force them to move to the cloud. So like in 2019 when we had a big program to upgrade all our customers to our latest version of MicroStrategy, this year and going forward, we'll have a program to move our customers to what we call our enterprise cloud. And then over time, we'll have them move to our SaaS cloud. We think it's an important core part to the business. What is that pacing? I think we'll know a lot better after this year at what pace we can move because we're not forcing our customers and we'll move as fast as can with respect to our customers. As far as our growth levels, we've talked about a long-term plan, call it three to five years, where we think we can achieve 10% revenue growth. We talked about that in our Analyst Day. Now does that translate to 7% to 9% CAGR over the next five years? I don't think we can get quite that specific yet. But we think that range is not unreasonable. And as a result of that, we think we can see some more incremental cash flow generated from the business so that we can reinvest it for corporate purposes or into Bitcoin. Yes. It's a good accounting question, but it's sort of the, I'll call it, book value of our Bitcoin versus what may be perceived as the market value of our Bitcoin. How we get to, based on the accounting of Bitcoin as an intangible asset, is every single quarter, we take each and every one of our wallets of Bitcoin and we look at the prevailing low price on our current exchange that we look at and we write-down or impair each of those wallets' stock price. And that's what's led to, I'll call it, sort of GAAP changes in our balance sheet that you saw in Q3 and Q4. And there is a - it creates a perceived disconnect between the book value and what one might interpret as the market value of our Bitcoin. What we've done is we provided non-GAAP financials that back out that impact in our financial statements and in our earnings report. And as a result, I think there's transparency into both means, the book value and a potential market value that someone can understand better. And I think the market understands that very well and it's very mature. So we don't really need to do any other, I'll call it, hedging of the volatility of our Bitcoin assets as a result."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Michael Saylor, Chairman and CEO. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nMichael Saylor: Hello. This is Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's conference call regarding our 2020 second quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who's going to read the Safe Harbor statement.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Michael, and good evening, everyone. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and our new presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at www.microstrategy.com. There's a lot to cover on today's call. I'll begin by providing a high level overview of our performance in the second quarter and provide our updated thinking regarding our strategic focus going forward. I'll then close with a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results, before turning the call over to Michael for his comments. Overall, we delivered solid second quarter results given the challenging global economic backdrop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continued to see healthy deal pipeline activity, and the selling dynamics at the end of June were somewhat better than what we experienced in March, at the height of the pandemic. However, there still is a great deal of uncertainty in the market, which has had an impact on our close rates. This impact shows that most notably in our product license revenue, which was down year-over-year, but did show improvement relative to the first quarter. We believe we will see further improvement in this area over time to the extent the macroeconomic environment improves. In the second quarter, we continued to see revenue growth from HyperIntelligence. And we signed a number of HyperIntelligence transactions with new and existing customers, including SEVEN-ELEVEN JAPAN, the Dubai Health Authority, and the International Commerce Bank of China, and several global software and financial services companies. We also saw notable strength in our cloud offering, which helped drive double-digit year-over-year growth in subscription billings. The enhancements we continue to make to our cloud platform coupled with the scalability and ease of deployment of a cloud platform are generating strong interest from customers. The rapid move to work-from-home environment has proven to be a catalyzing event for many organizations that has been reevaluating the pace and scope of their digital transformation initiatives. We believe our cloud platform is well-positioned to benefit more companies as they look to move away from their traditional on-premise IT stacks. One other notable area of strength in the second quarter and a last year has been our OEM business where companies embed the MicroStrategy platform into their end customer solutions. MicroStrategy\u2019s modern, open enterprise grade platform is rated the number one OEM business intelligence solution by several industry analysts. We also made notable improvements in profitability with non-GAAP operating income of $8.6 million, an increase of $10.3 million from our non-GAAP operating loss of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. This reflects the impact of our cost rationalization efforts over the past year, as well as additional steps taken during the quarter. We have reduced year-over-year non-GAAP operating expenses for the past three quarters with total non-GAAP operating expenses down $16.2 million, or 17% year-over-year in the second quarter. We are pleased with the profitability improvements we've generated across the business as a result of shifts in our go-to-market approach, scaling our cloud business and increased focus on G&A expenses. We intent of these initiatives is to run a more lean and efficient organization committed to generating increased cash flow while still focusing on revenue growth. I'll talk more about additional opportunities for improvement in a few moments. From a go-to-market perspective in the second quarter, we made significant progress virtualizing business operations. For example, we\u2019ve been very pleased with the productivity improvements we're generating from the fully virtualized marketing program. As discussed last quarter, virtual events and an increased focus on driving lead flow through our interactive website allows us to reach for much greater number of customers more quickly with greater flexibility and a materially lower costs than the traditional live events and static website, a core part of our historical marketing efforts. We're now fully committed to a virtual demand generation approach and expect this to represent the majority of our marketing strategy even after the pandemic is behind us. We're also making changes to our sales focus. We'll now be leading with our cloud platform in most discussions with prospects and customers. We\u2019re leaning on a cloud-based approach, given the early traction we are seeing with our cloud platform and our view that many organizations are likely to accelerate cloud deployments, post COVID. The benefits of the cloud deployment are becoming more apparent to many customers. And we believe that replatforming of the data warehouse layer, which is a common catalyst for switching to a cloud BI platform has reached a critical mass. To facilitate this trend, we plan to make our cloud pricing more transparent online for prospective customers and make it easier for them to buy our cloud platform and HyperIntelligence in the second half of 2020 and into 2021. By simplifying our pricing and building out our online and digital marketing efforts, we believe we can reach a broader cross-section of potential customers than we have historically. Going forward, we'll also begin instituting incentive programs for existing on-premise customers to begin migrating to our cloud platform. We believe there are significant benefits for customers who are ready to make the transition to a cloud deployment. To be clear, we don't intend to force any customer to move, and we will continue to sell and support our traditional on-premise platform for the foreseeable future. We have deep and trusted relationships with our customers and we are committed to their success. We recognize that there are some customers that operate in a highly-regulated industries or are just at the beginning of their digital transformation strategies that are unlikely to move to the cloud anytime soon. We believe, there's a strong demand for our cloud platform and our expectation is that a cloud first focus will also make it easier to do business in MicroStrategy. We're continuing to evaluate the revenue impact from this transition, which will change the mix of revenue between product license revenues, support revenues and subscription revenues in favor of the latter over time. However, I would note that we expect this transition will likely take a few years to affect. So, the P&L impact is expected to be more modest than many other subscription transitions in the software industry. The transition to cloud will be a priority for us going forward. Shifting license revenue from product licenses to subscriptions may make it more difficult for us to achieve top-line revenue growth in the next year. We also believe we can run the business much more efficiently than we have in the past. As we further operationalize our virtual strategy, which includes changing our marketing programs, as we noted above, as well as making changes to our global facilities footprint and our travel and entertainment expenses, we believe we can achieve additional material reductions in our cost structure. We recently reduced our workforce by 6% in early July. While it\u2019s never easy to let people go, the operational changes we're making to the business mean we can do more with less. The actions we've taken in the second quarter of 2020 and will continue to take the rest of the year should significantly reduce operating expenses going forward compared to second quarter levels. We believe overall non-GAAP operating expenses in 2020 will be 10% to 15% lower than in 2019 and that we can approach and potentially exceed 10% non-GAAP operating margins in 2020. Looking beyond this year, we believe that we can generate $60 million to $90 million of non-GAAP operating income in 2021. Going forward, our goal is to consistently generate profitability at this level or higher. At the same time, our commitment to profitability is not at the expense of top-line growth. We believe, our focus on HyperIntelligence, our transition to cloud, our OEM business and embracing the virtual wave will position us to help increase both, revenue and productivity. With our commitment to generating long-term operating income and free cash flow, we'll also take a more opportunistic approach to our balance sheet. We believe we can manage our day to day business with approximately $50 million of operating cash. This means approximately $500 million of excess cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which we\u2019ll be more active and managing. To-date, we've been utilizing our cash to generate shareholder value through share purchases, including $11.1 million in the second quarter. Overall, we've returned more than $245 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.8 million shares since the fourth quarter of 2018. Our capital allocation strategy going forward is to return a portion of this excess capital to our shareholders and invest a portion in assets with higher return profiles and cash. Accordingly, today, we are announcing a capital allocation strategy under which we plan to return up to $250 million to our shareholders over the next 12 months. In addition, we will seek to invest up to another $250 million over the next 12 months in one or more alternative investments or assets, which may include stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets, such as bitcoin, or other asset types. Both of these strategies will depend on market conditions. Turning to our second quarter 2020 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $110.6 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% on a constant currency basis. Product license revenues were $14.8 million in the second quarter of 2020, a $5.3 million or 26% decrease year-over-year and down 23% on a constant currency basis. We experienced delays in closing certain product license deals in the quarter, due to a general increase in the time it takes to close deals in the current depressed macroeconomic environment. We may continue to experience decreased product license revenues compared to prior year periods, until the effects of the pandemic have subsided. Subscription services revenue in the second quarter of 2020 were $8.0 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. The growth of subscription services revenues reflects the growing portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform. Product support revenues were $70.0 million in the second quarter of 2020, a 4% decrease year-over-year and a decrease of 2% on a constant currency basis. The larger than usual year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of one, a decrease in new product support contracts; two, certain customers converting from perpetual licenses to our subscription services offering; and three, higher than usual Q2 2019 product support revenue, due to several late renewals closing in that quarter. Our renewal rates remained strong in this quarter. Trailing 12-month product support revenues were up slightly year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Finally, services, which largely reflects our consulting services, increased 1% year-over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis. We continued to deliver services remotely to our customers and we're expecting that remote delivery trend to continue. While consulting revenue grew 7% year-over-year, educational revenue decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily as a result of a decrease in the average sales price of our education offerings and free education offered to customers in late first quarter and early second quarter. Total deferred revenue at June 30, 2020 was $173.6 million. This is down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to support contract ended fluctuations and to a lesser extent, migration to subscription services. Foreign currency translations negatively impacted deferred revenue by 1%, particularly in support revenue. As we begin to see more existing customers convert to our managed cloud platform, there is a shift from deferred product support revenue to deferred subscription services revenue. Total GAAP expenses were $104.3 million in the second quarter of 2020, a 15% decrease year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year cost decrease is driven by efficiency in staffing, reductions in corporate travel and a reduction in the number of in-person events, mostly related to marketing. Over the last three months, like many corporations, MicroStrategy has spent significant time evaluating our business and our go-forward strategy. We're excited about the plan we developed and for the future of the Company. We\u2019ll continue to focus on revenue growth in our core business, primarily from HyperIntelligence, our cloud platform and our OEM business. We are simplifying and streamlining our go-to-market approach, including our offerings and pricing. And we'll be offering a cloud for Platform as a Service solution with a greater focus on prospects. We believe these changes will allow us to streamline our cost structure throughout the business, leading to material improvements in operating margins, EBITDA margins, and free cash flow. As a result, we expect we can run our business at approximately $50 million in operating cash, allowing us to utilize our excess cash strategically and transparently, returning a portion to shareholders and making alternative investments in assets with higher return profiles and cash. I will now turn the call over to Michael for additional thoughts.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Phong. I have a few things to add regarding Q2 and our results. I expected our license execution to be choppy due to the degree of uncertainty in the quarter. But, I was pleased to see the support cloud and consulting revenues holding up strong. Given the currency headwinds and the lockdown challenges, I think our team performed well. The Company's doing a good job of managing expenses and transitioning into a more digital firm. We have adopted Zoom as corporate standard, our systems are holding up well as we work remotely, productivity is improving. I often times point out to the executives of the firm and the virtual age. You can now fly anywhere at the speed of light and you can bend time and space. When you Zoom somewhere, what would have been a one day travel trip, becomes a one hour meeting. And when you record the meeting, a meeting with one person might become a video watched 500 times, and of course, the video might be watched 300 times while you're sleeping. And so, shifting into a Zooming environment with streaming video in order to do sales, marketing and services is just one of the profoundly interesting dividends of the year 2020. And it's driving changes in the way we do our sales, the way we do our marketing, the way we think about support, the way we think about all of our internal reviews and our corporate activities. And I am -- I think based upon these new approaches, we'll continue to see improvements to sales, marketing, service and corporate productivity going forward. We're learning new things -- new ways to do things every day. We're getting more efficient. We're getting higher velocity. We're injecting more automation content into our business processes. I'd like to say few words about our technology focus, looking out. As we look forward for the coming year, we're really focused upon delivering our HyperIntelligence and our business intelligence capabilities, and a high-performance low-maintenance, multi-tenant cloud environment. We call that the MicroStrategy Cloud platform, or MicroStrategy Cloud Intelligence, MCI for short sometimes. And the idea of the MCI offering is to combine the license, the cloud environment, the administration, the support, and hosting elements into a single offering that we can sell at the term license, similar to the way that Slack and Zoom sell. If you have 1,000 users and you want HyperIntelligence, we're going to give you HyperIntelligence for 1,000 users for a certain price per user per month on an annual contract. We plan to release HyperIntelligence on this MCI platform in Q3. We refer to it as HyperNow. HyperNow is going to allow you to deploy HyperIntelligence to your entire enterprise in less than one hour. That's the marketing moniker. \"Deploy HyperIntelligence to your enterprise in less than an hour.\" We're just extraordinarily excited about this. It's going to be dramatically easier to buy, dramatically easier to try, dramatically easier to market and sell. And we think that this is a great way for us to spread our intelligence value proposition everywhere. We hope to deliver business intelligence on this MCI platform in Q4. And the marketing moniker will be \u201cDeploy business intelligence to your enterprise in an afternoon.\u201d And that would be our modern data sets federated data, our dossiers, our modern dossier based mobile applications, and traditional dossier, dashboard type applications running on Android and iOS and Mac clients and Window clients and then the web. And we're excited about that. So, I think, we've got an exciting technology plan that builds on the strengths of our platform, but we're productizing it in a way that thousands of customers can find on our website, they can go to our website, they can learn everything they didn\u2019t know about product offering from streaming videos, then they can start their trial, then they can deploy the application, all of that without any human intervention or without a lot of manual labor or friction involved. So, it is a truly virtual version of the MicroStrategy platform. It should be dramatically easier to deploy. So, that's an exciting thing for us. And I think the growth will come from that MicroStrategy Cloud intelligence initiative over time. I would like to say a few words about Phong and his promotion to the role of President. I'm really pleased that Phong assumed role the President of MicroStrategy. In this capacity, he'll be able to integrate sales, marketing, services, corporate, finance and technology operations of the firm more tightly. He's proven himself to be a very adept and agile high-bandwidth leader. We made this decision in order to leverage his skills more fully. The time is fortuitous, since the Company needs to transform and integrate more tightly due to the digital transformation being driven by the virtual wave. Now, having a single hands-on executive holding all of the various pieces together and driving operational efficiency is more important than ever before. So, this transition is partially about and due to Phong and his great capabilities, and it's also a great thing at the right time, because of our virtual transformation. I am going to continue to be engaged full time in corporate strategy and marketing strategy and product strategy, working hands-on, on product design and systems development. And I'll be focusing on our alternative investment strategy and then execution of that strategy. Generally my focus will be on items that are one to three years out, and Phong will be running the day to day operations of the business. A few words about our corporate strategy. During Q2, we gained better clarity regarding the impact of COVID and the transition to the virtual wave and the impact that was going to have on core business. These observations combined with the major developments and the macroeconomic environment that took place during the quarter, have prompted us to adjust our corporate strategy for our business operations and also to adjust our corporate strategy for our treasury policy and how we're going to make use of our balance sheet. Regarding our business operations. Our core value proposition of enterprise intelligence remains strong. Our secondary value proposition of intelligent services and all the things related to our software has transitioned smoothly. We found that there's as much demand as ever for enterprise intelligence, and we're able to provide the consulting and the support in a virtual environment, effectively. Our customer base has weathered the crisis and is holding. Our operations have simplified as we transitioned away from traditional sales and marketing techniques, flying around going to trade shows, meeting face-to-face with customers, and we moved to digital techniques, streaming video, Zoom meetings, et cetera. We're getting the same thing done, but in a quicker, easier and more efficient fashion. That's caused our productivity to improve with the introduction of all these digital techniques. Our key growth opportunity is HyperIntelligence sold to our enterprise customers. And the exciting new thing is going to be HyperNow sold out of our cloud environment. So, our product strategy is to refine and deploy HyperNow. We can deploy HyperIntelligence to your enterprise in less than an hour. So, it's going to be an extraordinary, extraordinary opportunity for us. So, given all of these things, we expect to generate cash flow and to be consistently profitable on an annual basis looking forward. We got opportunities to grow revenue and increase margins as well on a go going forward basis. And, we don't expect our continuing operations or our growth to be capital intensive. Phong has laid out all of these things pretty effectively. I think, our conviction with regard to these considerations became much stronger as the quarter progressed. At the end of March, there's a huge amount of uncertainty in the macro environment and in the business environment, and there is a lot of uncertainty, both with regard to how our customer base would react and also how our business would be impacted. I think that after 12 weeks of experience, we're able to get our bearings. And that made us confident that in fact, we can run an enterprise intelligence business more efficiently and with a higher velocity and generate cash flow from it. And that caused us to start to reassess the balance sheet. And I think, the balance sheet is the second part of our corporate strategy that\u2019s material. We have a large amount of USD on our balance sheet and we have carried that for a while. Over time, the yield on our dollar values has decreased. And at points we had an expectation that we would get higher real yields. And therefore, there was no real urgency to address this issue. But, as of today, we're expecting negative real returns or negative real yields on U.S. dollars. And that's an expectation that has materially changed over the course of the last three months. We expect on a macroeconomic basis more monetary stimulus from the Fed. We expect more fiscal stimulus from politicians, both in the U.S. and Europe and perhaps everywhere else in the world. And we expect a low interest rate environment for quite some time. As Jerome Powell said, we're not thinking about raising interest rates and we're not even thinking about thinking about raising interest rates. And that being the case, if you have large dollar values and you're hoping for any kind of return on them, that\u2019s faded. Gold, silver and bitcoin are showing strength, the dollar the DXY index is weakening. Faith in fiat currency across the market is fading. And we've seen that in rallies and most asset classes during Q2. Accordingly, it wouldn't be prudent to continue to hold a large portion of USD as our treasury strategy. And that's prompted us to rethink this. Our strategy is to return a portion of our capital to the shareholders via buybacks and invest another portion of our capital into assets other than dollars that will yield a positive real rate of return. That will result in us reducing the number of shares outstanding, and that should be accretive to all shareholders. Having said that, we need to maintain a healthy capital base. It's the equivalent of our endowment as an institution. And we need that capital base in order to assure our investors, our employees, our customers, and our partners that we're going to be around through good times and bad times. So, while it's potentially dilutive for us to carry that capital in dollars, that doesn't mean that we don't need capital. Hence, and we look at assets, gold, silver, bitcoin in equities have all been accreting as the dollar has been weakening, it makes sense to shift our treasury assets into some investments that can be inflated away, or are less likely to be inflated away. There's just about nobody we can find in the market today that isn't expecting some form of inflation to come. So, as we pursue alternative investment strategies for our treasury assets, we expect that we will have more volatility, at least as measured in U.S. dollar terms looking forward. But with the consensus of the market that fiat currencies are going to continue to debase, now's the time for us to address this issue and make a change in our policy. We're going to work to execute this two-pronged investment strategy over the next year, taking into account market conditions and the opportunities as they arise. And with that, I would like to go ahead and open the floor for questions from the analysts.\nOperator: For our first question we have Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is now open.\nTyler Radke: Hey. Thanks and good evening, Michael and Phong. Phong, I appreciate all the clarity you've given us on some of the efforts you've put into reducing expenses, both from workforce reductions and sizing down your global footprint. Maybe help us understand some of the assumptions into that $60 million to $90 million op income range next year. Obviously, op income\u2019s a combination of revenue and operating expenses. So, just how should we think about kind of the trajectory of those two items to get us to that $60 million to $90 million range that you put out there?\nPhong Le: Yes. Tyler, good to hear from you, as always. A lot of that range between 60 and 90 is dependent on where we think revenues will go next year. And the dependency on revenue is primarily based on the speed of adoption of cloud. The speed with which we move existing customers, who are paying maintenance to cloud platform could actually be accretive to revenue moving from product support to subscription services. But, the speed which we move customers from the new customers or new product license revenue to subscription services, as you know, could, in the short-term, be dilutive to revenue, but improve our overall balance sheet and deferred revenue. So, that uncertainty is what's going to drive that differential between sort of $60 million to $90 million. And of course, also, in addition to that, just sort of what are our assumptions on revenue growth overall. The parts that we're fairly certain about is where we think we can take our cost structure, right? You've seen in the course of this quarter a roughly 15% year-over-year decrease in our operating expenses. I think, we can continue with that type of a pace on a go forward basis. And, realizing a full year of that could be quite beneficial to our operating income. So those are the two components. I would say the revenue is what creates the range and a cost, we have greater certainty. And as Michael mentioned, we really thought long and hard in the last three months about how we want to run our business. And we think we can do it in a more economic fashion. And I do want to stress, it's not -- this is not sort of harvesting the business for cash. We can be more economic but still be able to grow the business.\nTyler Radke: I appreciate that. And maybe just to help clarify a little bit. So, just to say to get to the $60 million, maybe just talk about the OpEx assumptions for next year. Would you expect another kind of double-digit decline in terms of OpEx growth next year?\nPhong Le: Probably not off of this year, or like -- I don't think we're going to get necessarily that aggressive, although we can, we'll start to look at the business overall. But, I think what we're assuming is what you saw sort of on a year-over-year basis in Q2. We can project that out for a full year and then realize the full year benefits of that. So, there are still other things that we can do, especially as we move more customers to cloud, I think we can get better economies of scale. Mike talked about some of our new product initiatives. To the extent that those take, those will require even lower sort of cost to serve, cost to sell, cost to market. And so, there is still additional things we can do that could create more cost savings that we'll evaluate over time.\nTyler Radke: Got it. And on the product support revenue, obviously that declined a little bit year-over-year. Maybe just help us understand when you think that starts to return to growth. I know, there were some timing issues -- or maybe the answer is with the subscription transition, it doesn't return to growth and you just see growth in subscription. But, maybe just help us understand the differences in growth in the product support versus subscription?\nPhong Le: Yes. I think the objective there is, as you see customers move from paying perpetual maintenance over to cloud that we see an uplift as we move them over. So, product support will decline over time, depending on the speed that we move customers to the cloud. But, they'll pick up and be revenue accretive over on the subscription services side. So, it's hard to project sort of how fast that will happen. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're starting to incent our sales force to move customers from on-prem to the cloud, at the extent, obviously that they increase our ARR. And that's been our observation to date is when we move customers from on-prem to the cloud, we do see an increase in ARR, and it's fairly significant. Right? Anywhere from, I'll call it, 20% to 50%. So, predicting the product support revenue going forward, the primary function of that is how quickly we move that revenue over to subscription services. And then, we see an uplift come out of it. So, overall, it should be accretive to total revenue by moving customers over.\nTyler Radke: And then, last question for me is just, obviously, these cost cuts are very positive in terms of returning to profitability and generating positive free cash flow. But, just how are you thinking about the impact on returning to revenue growth? I mean, I imagine you look at your sales and marketing expenses are down pretty significantly year-over-year. So, just how confident are you that you can return to revenue growth, despite making some pretty big cost reductions in areas that would generally be viewed as revenue generating?\nPhong Le: Yes It's interesting, and Mike talked about this. The world has really changed. Right? So, big primary, like sort of things that have reduced, like in-person marketing events. We've moved it to digital. We haven't seen a substantial decrease in pipeline, as a result. In fact, in some regions of the world, we've seen an increase in pipeline. So, we were spending significantly less money, if not impacting our ability to market to our customers and our prospects. Right? T&E expenses, there is always been a historical point of view that you need to be in front of a customer to -- for that initial meeting for the POC to close the deal. We've seen that hasn't been the case. And we think that we don't need to return to previous levels. Now, are we going to be operating at zero T&E post-COVID? Probably not, but we think that we can be much less than we've ever been in the past, without an impact to revenue again. And those are probably the two big buckets on the marketing side. And then, just in terms of sales productivity, our view is, if people aren't traveling, if they aren't going to these physical events and they're not spending time on an airplane, they're able to take more meetings, meet with more customers, advanced deal cycles. And so, we're able to do more with less over time, and we're seeing this. Generally speaking, in the enterprise software world happen pervasively, we have a good portion of being a pretty agile company. We move quickly. We make fast decisions. So, we think that all these cost changes -- and then, as we move to cloud, like when we are able to attract customers through digital channels, consume -- get them to trial on the web, get them to buy very quickly after a trial, and click wrap agreements, very standard agreements, standard upgrades. Like, a lot of the back office expenses over time will be able to reduce too, and we're seeing some of that. So, it's all sort of this digital transformation that the Company is going through. And so, the reason we're able to start providing guidance about operating income next year is, we have a lot of conviction and the ability to make these changes to the business. And a year from now or two or three years from now, not necessarily have to reintroduce these costs as a means to generate revenue. We think we can generate revenue growth without these costs for the foreseeable future.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Your line is now open.\nHamed Khorsand: Hi. So, first, I want to start off with, have you already implemented your asset investment strategy?\nPhong Le: No, we haven't. We're announcing our strategy today as part of our earnings, and we'll start to implement over the course of the next 12 months.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And then, what do you see in terms of the customer base as far as the adoption is concerned on your cloud products, that gives you conviction over this guidance and the OpEx cut that you're expecting?\nPhong Le: Yes. So, the conviction we have on the guidance and the OpEx cuts is partially related to the implementation of our cloud platform. But, as I mentioned to Tyler, it's also related to things that we're able to do to change our marketing, our productivity, et cetera. On the cloud side, we've definitely seen a wave in the last year or two years of customers, especially leading with cloud data warehouses and Cloud BI of the interest in moving the cloud. And so, conversations that we've had have been pretty pervasive throughout the world, the customers uptick in cloud. You're seeing it initially show up in our subscription services revenue, increasing 13% to 15%, depending on the quarter that you're looking at. So, that sort of initial traction on our cloud subscription services revenue is an indication of where we think we can take this. And remember, this is before we've fully implemented, what I would call, more of a Platform as a Service solution. This is running what we've been running for the last few years now, more of a private cloud. So, we have seen initial indications of interest from our customers. We've seen initial buying activity, customers buying into the cloud, both migrating existing customers and new prospects, and we expect this will accelerate. The other thing I'd mention is sort of post-COVID, a lot of our customers are coming back and asking for -- to move to the cloud in even a more rapid way. So, there is definitely a lot of data points that point to the increased adoption of our Cloud Platform.\nHamed Khorsand: And because of this pandemic, what are you seeing from customers as far as anything from a budget cut standpoint or elongated sales process?\nPhong Le: Yes. And that's the primary reason for our Q1 and Q2 decreases in product license revenue. I think, we're seeing two factors. One, at the end of Q1, what we were seeing was a distraction, customers not willing to have conversations and buying BI software because they're trying to figure out business continuity. In Q2, what we're seeing is either budget freezes or escalation of budget authority to more senior levels. We are starting to see some relaxation on that. But, you know that not long enough that we can predict what will happen in Q3 or Q4. But, we do expect a turnaround once the global pandemic starts to ease and the economic situation becomes more-clear for everyone. But, in the short term, it surfaces itself in longer deal cycles, unexpected escalations of authority required to sign on a deal. And so, we're putting in things in place more precision on our deal side to predict for that.\nHamed Khorsand: And if today was Q3 quarter-end, how much of a benefit or impact would you see from the weaker U.S. dollar?\nPhong Le: You mean on our balance sheet or on our income statement?\nHamed Khorsand: Income statement.\nPhong Le: I don't think we would see a lot of a benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar. I mean, it just really depends on the extent that we have our earnings sort of in the U.S. versus international. And as you probably know, there\u2019s a lot of volatility quarter-to-quarter on our product license revenue, whether it's happening in the U.S. versus international. One quarter, it might be 40% U.S., 60% international; the next quarter, it might be 70% U.S., 30% international. So, that distribution will be what affects sort of U.S. dollar translation of our international income into our income statement. And when we move to cloud, when we move to subscription services, we'll see less volatility in that distribution. But, while a large part of our revenues is coming from product license, there will be a lot of volatility still.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions. Please proceed.\nMichael Saylor: Okay. So, are there no further questions?\nOperator: There are no further questions.\nMichael Saylor: Okay, great. I want to thank everybody for tuning in today to our call and to all of our shareholders on the call. Thank you for your support. We\u2019ll look forward to speaking with you again in 12 weeks. Until then, be safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I'd like to welcome all of you to today's conference call regarding our 2020 second quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who's going to read the Safe Harbor statement. Thank you, Phong. I have a few things to add regarding Q2 and our results.

And that made us confident that in fact, we can run an enterprise intelligence business more efficiently and with a higher velocity and generate cash flow from it. And that caused us to start to reassess the balance sheet. And I think, the balance sheet is the second part of our corporate strategy that's material. We have a large amount of USD on our balance sheet and we have carried that for a while. Over time, the yield on our dollar values has decreased. And at points we had an expectation that we would get higher real yields. And therefore, there was no real urgency to address this issue. But, as of today, we're expecting negative real returns or negative real yields on U.S. dollars. And that's an expectation that has materially changed over the course of the last three months. We expect on a macroeconomic basis more monetary stimulus from the Fed. We expect more fiscal stimulus from politicians, both in the U.S. and Europe and perhaps everywhere else in the world. And we expect a low interest rate environment for quite some time. As Jerome Powell said, we're not thinking about raising interest rates and we're not even thinking about thinking about raising interest rates. And that being the case, if you have large dollar values and you're hoping for any kind of return on them, that's faded. Gold, silver and bitcoin are showing strength, the dollar the DXY index is weakening. Faith in fiat currency across the market is fading. And we've seen that in rallies and most asset classes during Q2. Accordingly, it wouldn't be prudent to continue to hold a large portion of USD as our treasury strategy. And that's prompted us to rethink this. Our strategy is to return a portion of our capital to the shareholders via buybacks and invest another portion of our capital into assets other than dollars that will yield a positive real rate of return. That will result in us reducing the number of shares outstanding, and that should be accretive to all shareholders. Having said that, we need to maintain a healthy capital base. It's the equivalent of our endowment as an institution. And we need that capital base in order to assure our investors, our employees, our customers, and our partners that we're going to be around through good times and bad times. So, while it's potentially dilutive for us to carry that capital in dollars, that doesn't mean that we don't need capital. Hence, and we look at assets, gold, silver, bitcoin in equities have all been accreting as the dollar has been weakening, it makes sense to shift our treasury assets into some investments that can be inflated away, or are less likely to be inflated away. There's just about nobody we can find in the market today that isn't expecting some form of inflation to come. So, as we pursue alternative investment strategies for our treasury assets, we expect that we will have more volatility, at least as measured in U.S. dollar terms looking forward. But with the consensus of the market that fiat currencies are going to continue to debase, now's the time for us to address this issue and make a change in our policy. We're going to work to execute this two-pronged investment strategy over the next year, taking into account market conditions and the opportunities as they arise. And with that, I would like to go ahead and open the floor for questions from the analysts. Okay. So, are there no further questions? Okay, great. I want to thank everybody for tuning in today to our call and to all of our shareholders on the call. Thank you for your support. We'll look forward to speaking with you again in 12 weeks. Until then, be safe."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good evening, everyone. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and our new presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at www.microstrategy.com. There's a lot to cover on today's call. I'll begin by providing a high level overview of our performance in the second quarter and provide our updated thinking regarding our strategic focus going forward. I'll then close with a more detailed review of our second quarter financial results, before turning the call over to Michael for his comments. Overall, we delivered solid second quarter results given the challenging global economic backdrop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continued to see healthy deal pipeline activity, and the selling dynamics at the end of June were somewhat better than what we experienced in March, at the height of the pandemic. However, there still is a great deal of uncertainty in the market, which has had an impact on our close rates. This impact shows that most notably in our product license revenue, which was down year-over-year, but did show improvement relative to the first quarter. We believe we will see further improvement in this area over time to the extent the macroeconomic environment improves. In the second quarter, we continued to see revenue growth from HyperIntelligence. And we signed a number of HyperIntelligence transactions with new and existing customers, including SEVEN-ELEVEN JAPAN, the Dubai Health Authority, and the International Commerce Bank of China, and several global software and financial services companies. We also saw notable strength in our cloud offering, which helped drive double-digit year-over-year growth in subscription billings. The enhancements we continue to make to our cloud platform coupled with the scalability and ease of deployment of a cloud platform are generating strong interest from customers. The rapid move to work-from-home environment has proven to be a catalyzing event for many organizations that has been reevaluating the pace and scope of their digital transformation initiatives. We believe our cloud platform is well-positioned to benefit more companies as they look to move away from their traditional on-premise IT stacks. One other notable area of strength in the second quarter and a last year has been our OEM business where companies embed the MicroStrategy platform into their end customer solutions. MicroStrategy's modern, open enterprise grade platform is rated the number one OEM business intelligence solution by several industry analysts. We also made notable improvements in profitability with non-GAAP operating income of $8.6 million, an increase of $10.3 million from our non-GAAP operating loss of $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2019. This reflects the impact of our cost rationalization efforts over the past year, as well as additional steps taken during the quarter. We have reduced year-over-year non-GAAP operating expenses for the past three quarters with total non-GAAP operating expenses down $16.2 million, or 17% year-over-year in the second quarter. We are pleased with the profitability improvements we've generated across the business as a result of shifts in our go-to-market approach, scaling our cloud business and increased focus on G&A expenses. We intent of these initiatives is to run a more lean and efficient organization committed to generating increased cash flow while still focusing on revenue growth. I'll talk more about additional opportunities for improvement in a few moments. From a go-to-market perspective in the second quarter, we made significant progress virtualizing business operations. For example, we've been very pleased with the productivity improvements we're generating from the fully virtualized marketing program. As discussed last quarter, virtual events and an increased focus on driving lead flow through our interactive website allows us to reach for much greater number of customers more quickly with greater flexibility and a materially lower costs than the traditional live events and static website, a core part of our historical marketing efforts. We're now fully committed to a virtual demand generation approach and expect this to represent the majority of our marketing strategy even after the pandemic is behind us. We're also making changes to our sales focus. We'll now be leading with our cloud platform in most discussions with prospects and customers. We're leaning on a cloud-based approach, given the early traction we are seeing with our cloud platform and our view that many organizations are likely to accelerate cloud deployments, post COVID. The benefits of the cloud deployment are becoming more apparent to many customers. And we believe that replatforming of the data warehouse layer, which is a common catalyst for switching to a cloud BI platform has reached a critical mass. To facilitate this trend, we plan to make our cloud pricing more transparent online for prospective customers and make it easier for them to buy our cloud platform and HyperIntelligence in the second half of 2020 and into 2021. By simplifying our pricing and building out our online and digital marketing efforts, we believe we can reach a broader cross-section of potential customers than we have historically. Going forward, we'll also begin instituting incentive programs for existing on-premise customers to begin migrating to our cloud platform. We believe there are significant benefits for customers who are ready to make the transition to a cloud deployment. To be clear, we don't intend to force any customer to move, and we will continue to sell and support our traditional on-premise platform for the foreseeable future. We have deep and trusted relationships with our customers and we are committed to their success. We recognize that there are some customers that operate in a highly-regulated industries or are just at the beginning of their digital transformation strategies that are unlikely to move to the cloud anytime soon. We believe, there's a strong demand for our cloud platform and our expectation is that a cloud first focus will also make it easier to do business in MicroStrategy. We're continuing to evaluate the revenue impact from this transition, which will change the mix of revenue between product license revenues, support revenues and subscription revenues in favor of the latter over time. However, I would note that we expect this transition will likely take a few years to affect. So, the P&L impact is expected to be more modest than many other subscription transitions in the software industry. The transition to cloud will be a priority for us going forward. Shifting license revenue from product licenses to subscriptions may make it more difficult for us to achieve top-line revenue growth in the next year. We also believe we can run the business much more efficiently than we have in the past. As we further operationalize our virtual strategy, which includes changing our marketing programs, as we noted above, as well as making changes to our global facilities footprint and our travel and entertainment expenses, we believe we can achieve additional material reductions in our cost structure. We recently reduced our workforce by 6% in early July. While it's never easy to let people go, the operational changes we're making to the business mean we can do more with less. The actions we've taken in the second quarter of 2020 and will continue to take the rest of the year should significantly reduce operating expenses going forward compared to second quarter levels. We believe overall non-GAAP operating expenses in 2020 will be 10% to 15% lower than in 2019 and that we can approach and potentially exceed 10% non-GAAP operating margins in 2020. Looking beyond this year, we believe that we can generate $60 million to $90 million of non-GAAP operating income in 2021. Going forward, our goal is to consistently generate profitability at this level or higher. At the same time, our commitment to profitability is not at the expense of top-line growth. We believe, our focus on HyperIntelligence, our transition to cloud, our OEM business and embracing the virtual wave will position us to help increase both, revenue and productivity. With our commitment to generating long-term operating income and free cash flow, we'll also take a more opportunistic approach to our balance sheet. We believe we can manage our day to day business with approximately $50 million of operating cash. This means approximately $500 million of excess cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which we'll be more active and managing. To-date, we've been utilizing our cash to generate shareholder value through share purchases, including $11.1 million in the second quarter. Overall, we've returned more than $245 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.8 million shares since the fourth quarter of 2018. Our capital allocation strategy going forward is to return a portion of this excess capital to our shareholders and invest a portion in assets with higher return profiles and cash. Accordingly, today, we are announcing a capital allocation strategy under which we plan to return up to $250 million to our shareholders over the next 12 months. In addition, we will seek to invest up to another $250 million over the next 12 months in one or more alternative investments or assets, which may include stocks, bonds, commodities such as gold, digital assets, such as bitcoin, or other asset types. Both of these strategies will depend on market conditions. Turning to our second quarter 2020 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $110.6 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% on a constant currency basis. Product license revenues were $14.8 million in the second quarter of 2020, a $5.3 million or 26% decrease year-over-year and down 23% on a constant currency basis. We experienced delays in closing certain product license deals in the quarter, due to a general increase in the time it takes to close deals in the current depressed macroeconomic environment. We may continue to experience decreased product license revenues compared to prior year periods, until the effects of the pandemic have subsided. Subscription services revenue in the second quarter of 2020 were $8.0 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. The growth of subscription services revenues reflects the growing portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform. Product support revenues were $70.0 million in the second quarter of 2020, a 4% decrease year-over-year and a decrease of 2% on a constant currency basis. The larger than usual year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of one, a decrease in new product support contracts; two, certain customers converting from perpetual licenses to our subscription services offering; and three, higher than usual Q2 2019 product support revenue, due to several late renewals closing in that quarter. Our renewal rates remained strong in this quarter. Trailing 12-month product support revenues were up slightly year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Finally, services, which largely reflects our consulting services, increased 1% year-over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis. We continued to deliver services remotely to our customers and we're expecting that remote delivery trend to continue. While consulting revenue grew 7% year-over-year, educational revenue decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily as a result of a decrease in the average sales price of our education offerings and free education offered to customers in late first quarter and early second quarter. Total deferred revenue at June 30, 2020 was $173.6 million. This is down 4% year-over-year, primarily due to support contract ended fluctuations and to a lesser extent, migration to subscription services. Foreign currency translations negatively impacted deferred revenue by 1%, particularly in support revenue. As we begin to see more existing customers convert to our managed cloud platform, there is a shift from deferred product support revenue to deferred subscription services revenue. Total GAAP expenses were $104.3 million in the second quarter of 2020, a 15% decrease year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year cost decrease is driven by efficiency in staffing, reductions in corporate travel and a reduction in the number of in-person events, mostly related to marketing. Over the last three months, like many corporations, MicroStrategy has spent significant time evaluating our business and our go-forward strategy. We're excited about the plan we developed and for the future of the Company. We'll continue to focus on revenue growth in our core business, primarily from HyperIntelligence, our cloud platform and our OEM business. We are simplifying and streamlining our go-to-market approach, including our offerings and pricing. And we'll be offering a cloud for Platform as a Service solution with a greater focus on prospects. We believe these changes will allow us to streamline our cost structure throughout the business, leading to material improvements in operating margins, EBITDA margins, and free cash flow. As a result, we expect we can run our business at approximately $50 million in operating cash, allowing us to utilize our excess cash strategically and transparently, returning a portion to shareholders and making alternative investments in assets with higher return profiles and cash. I will now turn the call over to Michael for additional thoughts. Yes. Tyler, good to hear from you, as always. A lot of that range between 60 and 90 is dependent on where we think revenues will go next year. And the dependency on revenue is primarily based on the speed of adoption of cloud. The speed with which we move existing customers, who are paying maintenance to cloud platform could actually be accretive to revenue moving from product support to subscription services. But, the speed which we move customers from the new customers or new product license revenue to subscription services, as you know, could, in the short-term, be dilutive to revenue, but improve our overall balance sheet and deferred revenue. So, that uncertainty is what's going to drive that differential between sort of $60 million to $90 million. And of course, also, in addition to that, just sort of what are our assumptions on revenue growth overall. The parts that we're fairly certain about is where we think we can take our cost structure, right? You've seen in the course of this quarter a roughly 15% year-over-year decrease in our operating expenses. I think, we can continue with that type of a pace on a go forward basis. And, realizing a full year of that could be quite beneficial to our operating income. So those are the two components. I would say the revenue is what creates the range and a cost, we have greater certainty. And as Michael mentioned, we really thought long and hard in the last three months about how we want to run our business. And we think we can do it in a more economic fashion. And I do want to stress, it's not -- this is not sort of harvesting the business for cash. We can be more economic but still be able to grow the business. Probably not off of this year, or like -- I don't think we're going to get necessarily that aggressive, although we can, we'll start to look at the business overall. But, I think what we're assuming is what you saw sort of on a year-over-year basis in Q2. We can project that out for a full year and then realize the full year benefits of that. So, there are still other things that we can do, especially as we move more customers to cloud, I think we can get better economies of scale. Mike talked about some of our new product initiatives. To the extent that those take, those will require even lower sort of cost to serve, cost to sell, cost to market. And so, there is still additional things we can do that could create more cost savings that we'll evaluate over time. Yes. I think the objective there is, as you see customers move from paying perpetual maintenance over to cloud that we see an uplift as we move them over. So, product support will decline over time, depending on the speed that we move customers to the cloud. But, they'll pick up and be revenue accretive over on the subscription services side. So, it's hard to project sort of how fast that will happen. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're starting to incent our sales force to move customers from on-prem to the cloud, at the extent, obviously that they increase our ARR. And that's been our observation to date is when we move customers from on-prem to the cloud, we do see an increase in ARR, and it's fairly significant. Right? Anywhere from, I'll call it, 20% to 50%. So, predicting the product support revenue going forward, the primary function of that is how quickly we move that revenue over to subscription services. And then, we see an uplift come out of it. So, overall, it should be accretive to total revenue by moving customers over. Yes It's interesting, and Mike talked about this. The world has really changed. Right? So, big primary, like sort of things that have reduced, like in-person marketing events. We've moved it to digital. We haven't seen a substantial decrease in pipeline, as a result. In fact, in some regions of the world, we've seen an increase in pipeline. So, we were spending significantly less money, if not impacting our ability to market to our customers and our prospects. Right? T&E expenses, there is always been a historical point of view that you need to be in front of a customer to -- for that initial meeting for the POC to close the deal. We've seen that hasn't been the case. And we think that we don't need to return to previous levels. Now, are we going to be operating at zero T&E post-COVID? Probably not, but we think that we can be much less than we've ever been in the past, without an impact to revenue again. And those are probably the two big buckets on the marketing side. And then, just in terms of sales productivity, our view is, if people aren't traveling, if they aren't going to these physical events and they're not spending time on an airplane, they're able to take more meetings, meet with more customers, advanced deal cycles. And so, we're able to do more with less over time, and we're seeing this. Generally speaking, in the enterprise software world happen pervasively, we have a good portion of being a pretty agile company. We move quickly. We make fast decisions. So, we think that all these cost changes -- and then, as we move to cloud, like when we are able to attract customers through digital channels, consume -- get them to trial on the web, get them to buy very quickly after a trial, and click wrap agreements, very standard agreements, standard upgrades. Like, a lot of the back office expenses over time will be able to reduce too, and we're seeing some of that. So, it's all sort of this digital transformation that the Company is going through. And so, the reason we're able to start providing guidance about operating income next year is, we have a lot of conviction and the ability to make these changes to the business. And a year from now or two or three years from now, not necessarily have to reintroduce these costs as a means to generate revenue. We think we can generate revenue growth without these costs for the foreseeable future. No, we haven't. We're announcing our strategy today as part of our earnings, and we'll start to implement over the course of the next 12 months. Yes. So, the conviction we have on the guidance and the OpEx cuts is partially related to the implementation of our cloud platform. But, as I mentioned to Tyler, it's also related to things that we're able to do to change our marketing, our productivity, et cetera. On the cloud side, we've definitely seen a wave in the last year or two years of customers, especially leading with cloud data warehouses and Cloud BI of the interest in moving the cloud. And so, conversations that we've had have been pretty pervasive throughout the world, the customers uptick in cloud. You're seeing it initially show up in our subscription services revenue, increasing 13% to 15%, depending on the quarter that you're looking at. So, that sort of initial traction on our cloud subscription services revenue is an indication of where we think we can take this. And remember, this is before we've fully implemented, what I would call, more of a Platform as a Service solution. This is running what we've been running for the last few years now, more of a private cloud. So, we have seen initial indications of interest from our customers. We've seen initial buying activity, customers buying into the cloud, both migrating existing customers and new prospects, and we expect this will accelerate. The other thing I'd mention is sort of post-COVID, a lot of our customers are coming back and asking for -- to move to the cloud in even a more rapid way. So, there is definitely a lot of data points that point to the increased adoption of our Cloud Platform. Yes. And that's the primary reason for our Q1 and Q2 decreases in product license revenue. I think, we're seeing two factors. One, at the end of Q1, what we were seeing was a distraction, customers not willing to have conversations and buying BI software because they're trying to figure out business continuity. In Q2, what we're seeing is either budget freezes or escalation of budget authority to more senior levels. We are starting to see some relaxation on that. But, you know that not long enough that we can predict what will happen in Q3 or Q4. But, we do expect a turnaround once the global pandemic starts to ease and the economic situation becomes more-clear for everyone. But, in the short term, it surfaces itself in longer deal cycles, unexpected escalations of authority required to sign on a deal. And so, we're putting in things in place more precision on our deal side to predict for that. You mean on our balance sheet or on our income statement? I don't think we would see a lot of a benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar. I mean, it just really depends on the extent that we have our earnings sort of in the U.S. versus international. And as you probably know, there's a lot of volatility quarter-to-quarter on our product license revenue, whether it's happening in the U.S. versus international. One quarter, it might be 40% U.S., 60% international; the next quarter, it might be 70% U.S., 30% international. So, that distribution will be what affects sort of U.S. dollar translation of our international income into our income statement. And when we move to cloud, when we move to subscription services, we'll see less volatility in that distribution. But, while a large part of our revenues is coming from product license, there will be a lot of volatility still."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Michael Saylor, Chairman, President and CEO. Please go ahead.\nMichael Saylor: Hello. This is Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman, President and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's conference call regarding our 2020 first quarter financial results. This has been quite an unusual and eventful quarter for the world; and for MicroStrategy, we\u2019re about to share an update. I will start with the change in our leadership team. Lisa Mayr has decided to resign from MicroStrategy to pursue other opportunities. We wish her well. I\u2019m happy to announce that in her place Phong Le has agreed to resume his duties as CFO in addition to continuing his role of COO. He is here with me today and we will start by sharing our Safe Harbor notice.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Michael, and good evening, everyone. Some of the information we provide during today\u2019s call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak only as of today. Also during today's call we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release which was issued today and is available on our website, www.microstrategy.com.I'd like to begin by saying we hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy in this difficult time. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global emergency that\u2019s fundamentally changed our business as being done, at least in the near term. At MicroStrategy we've successfully instituted a work from home initiative for all of our employees. I am pleased that how quickly we're able to make this transition. While working from home is not a perfect substitute for our normal working environment, it does present challenges. I want to thank all MicroStrategy employees for quickly adapting to the situation and their dedication to ensuring our customers' success.Before I review our first quarter results, I want to reiterate a few key points about MicroStrategy\u2019s financial strength that we believe are particularly important in the current environment. As the management team, we will take the steps necessary to work through this economics and public health crisis, while also helping to ensure we're making the investments necessary to capitalize on our market strength.We have a strong balance sheet with more than $500 million of cash and short-term investments and no debt. MicroStrategy is a 30 year old business that has experienced tough economic cycles before. We believe our debt free balance sheet is a strategic asset for the company and provides us with significant flexibility in uncertain economic times. We have over $300 million in annualized subscription term and product support revenue. This is a stable, highly profitable source of recurring revenue for us and one of the key strengths in our financial model. We have high gross margins, a cost structure that's mostly variable or reasonably flexible and low capital investment requirements. This scalable and flexible cost structure enables us to react quickly in an uncertain environment.Today I'll provide a high level overview of our first quarter performance, how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our business, provide an update on our strategic goals for 2020, discussing product updates and finish by discussing Q1 in more detail. We were on track to have strong first quarter license revenues through the middle of March. On an average, we typically close about 50% of our license revenues in the last two weeks of each quarter.In March, we began to see some deals slippage as certain customers pulled back on investments given the high degree of uncertainty in the market as well as their need to focus on operational continuity for their employees and customers. Overall, I\u2019d characterize our Q1 performance as reasonable given the environment at the end of the quarter. We continue to take steps to support our customers during this time and make it easier to do business with MicroStrategy.We're now providing free upgrades to the latest version of our platform MicroStrategy 2020. Over 1,000 customers are in MicroStrategy 2019 are 2020. Our customers appreciate having access to the latest software and the most comprehensive security features in MicroStrategy 2020, which help support their work from home initiatives. Proactive customer engagement is delivering good upgrade activity which we believe will help sustain high renewal rates and drive increased spend from existing customers over time.Similarly, we made our online learning portal free to use through May 15th providing our customers access to hundreds of hours of training courses, certifications, and tutorials. We've seen a tremendous response from customers and partners with nearly -- with over 15,000 unique user registrations since we announced the program. The free upgrades in education demonstrate our commitment to be a long-term partner focused on our customers' success, which we believe will benefit us in the future.Our field sales organization has quickly adapted to engaging with customers virtually. We have strategic and longstanding relationships with many of our customers, which makes it easier to engage virtually. We have also used this opportunity to simplify our sales and sales enablement processes so that we make it easier to sell our products and demonstrate a faster ROI to our customers.All of our marketing events have moved to virtual platforms. We're seeing significant benefits to this approach, including making it easier to organize and schedule customer events and being able to leverage our senior leadership and thought leaders more broadly. For example, we ran a virtual roundtable for our federal business, bringing together our best customers to discuss issues and challenges they're facing. The group was moderated by our Head of Marketing. In the past we've had two of the top three highest attended webcasts in the history of our company. This combination of strong customer interest, greater flexibility and significant cost savings encourage us to focus more on virtual marketing resources and events going forward.We continued our progress of selling our managed cloud platform in Q1 which as a reminder is at full parity to our enterprise grade on-premise product. In today's environment, businesses are looking for fast, secure and economical solutions and that is how we are positioning our product. Our customers understand that by using our managed cloud platform, they can lower total cost of ownership and get data faster and more securely.Before turning to the financials, I'd like to review the highlights from our Annual MicroStrategy World User Conference in Orlando. This is one of the best attended world events we've hosted with around 2,500 attendees. The highlight of the event was the introduction of MicroStrategy 2020, our latest platform release that builds on the tremendous innovation of MicroStrategy 2019. In particular MicroStrategy 2020 includes additional enhancements to hyperIntelligence, making it easier to gain insights from popular websites, applications and devices people use every day including Chrome, Edge and Outlook.Customers can now click on dynamic links within a HyperIntelligence card to take direct action, make it seamless for an insight interaction. We signed transactions with some great new HyperIntelligence customers including Pfizer, the General Services Administration and Nu Skin Enterprises. Customer feedback on our new innovations and product roadmap has been very positive and underscores our position as a leader in the enterprise analytics market.It's not just our customers that are recognizing the strength in the MicroStrategy platform, MicroStrategy received the highest use case scores from Gartner in the Enterprise Analytics Use Case, 4.86 out of 5 and Embedded Analytics Use Case, 4.96 out of 5 in the Gartner 2020 Critical Capabilities for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms report. We're very proud of these scores and believe our breakthrough technology of HyperIntelligence satisfies the new customer use case for speed and agility that hasn't been addressed by traditional analytics and BI tools.Turning to our financial results in more detail, revenues for the quarter were $111.4 million, down 3.4% year-over-year and 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Product license revenues were $12.6 million in Q1 2020, a $5.7 million or 31.2% decrease year-over-year and 28.2% on a constant currency basis. As discussed, we had a number of deals within a few weeks of the first quarter related to -- in the last few weeks of the first quarter related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as of the end of Q1, no major deals were lost due to COVID-19.We may experience decreased product license revenues compared to prior year periods until the effects of the pandemics has subsided. Subscription services revenue of $8 million in Q1 2020 were up 11.5% year-over-year and up 9.9% compared to the three months ending December 31, 2019. The growth of subscription services revenue reflects the growing portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform.Product support revenues were $71.2 million in Q1 2020, a slight decrease year-over-year, but 1.2% increase on a constant currency basis. Our renewal rates remained strong this quarter. Although our product support revenues were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, during Q1 2020, our product support revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods to the extent the customers require extended payment terms or determine not to renew their product support arrangements as part of their efforts to reduce expenses.Finally, you'll note that other services, which is largely our consulting services, increased 6.7% year-over-year, 8.1% on a constant currency basis. We've been delighted in our consulting organization\u2019s ability to continue to effectively deliver services remotely to our customers and we are expecting that remote delivery trend to continue. This is a great example of our operational agility and focused on serving our customers. Although our consulting revenues were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2020, we may experience declines in our consulting revenues in future periods as our customers continue operating in remote work environments and aim to reduce expenses.Total deferred revenue and advance payments at March 31, 2020 were $188.6 million. This was down 3.1% year-over-year, but there are two factors that play here. First, there is a relatively large foreign exchange impact of 1.7%, particularly impacting our product support deferred revenue. Secondly, we had an unusually high rate of renewals in our managed cloud platform business that slipped into early April primarily due to customer administrative delays. These renewals have since closed.One other thing to note within deferred revenue, as we begin to see more existing customers convert to our managed cloud platform, there is a shift for deferred product support revenue to deferred subscription services revenue.Turning to cost, gross margin for the quarter improved slightly to 78% compared to 77.3% in the same period last year, partly due to improved consulting utilization. Total operating expenses were $87.0 million in Q1 2020, a 12.7% decrease year-over-year and down 12.4% quarter over quarter. The year-over-year cost decrease is driven by efficiency in staffing, reductions in corporate travel and a reduction in the number of in-person events, mostly related to marketing.We also had a one-time benefit from the cancellation of our sales employee awards event which was required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Driving efficiencies across the company is a key strategic focus for us and we continue to balance making investments in the business that will enhance our growth opportunities with identifying opportunities to take cost out of the business. We're confident that we can improve both top-line growth and margins over time.Turning toward our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $539 million in cash and short-term investments. You will note that during the quarter we repurchased approximately 355,000 shares of MicroStrategy class A common stock for $50.7 million. We'll continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase activity, which is one component of how we think about long-term capital allocation. As a reminder, our policy is not to discuss our buyback intention in advance.Looking ahead, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the world. Like most companies, we're evaluating the financial impact to our business. From a demand perspective, we're seeing the positive impact from our product and go-to-market investments over the past 18 months and our pipeline for product license and cloud subscription sales.In a normalized environment I would be feeling confident in our ability to generate constant currency revenue growth. However, given the high level of uncertainty in the market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the associated economic disruption and the deal slippage we experienced at the end of March, we expect our ability to convert this pipeline to sign deals would be more challenging. Right now, there is simply a wide range of outcomes for product sales in Q2 and the balance of the year. We also expect to see some modest headwinds to our product support and consulting revenues over the rest of the year. We have a highly diverse customer base and consistently high renewal rates.We do have some customers with extreme challenges in their business that we believe may lead to some payment lapses or delays leading to some pressure on renewal rates. We are expecting some pressure on consulting revenues as some customers look at ways to reduce spending to manage their near term expenses.With regard to expenses, as we discussed last quarter, we believe we have right-sized the organization to allow us to continue to invest in our business. Our prior initiatives, including driving greater productivity in sales are moving some of our R&D and overhead functions to lower cost locations.Now, with the recent changes to our marketing programs and reductions in travel, we believe we have the ability to offset a potential drop in revenues. Our objective is to deliver positive operating margin and positive free cash flow in 2020.Now, I'd like to turn it back to Michael Saylor.\nMichael Saylor: Thanks, Phong. Yes, as Phong said, there are challenging times, but we feel pretty good about the path ahead. We're pretty seasoned company. We\u2019ve been around 30 years. We've lived through a number of other crises. About every 10 years, there's normally a difficult time. I think our balance sheet is a great asset. We're sitting on all cash with no debt and so we\u2019re -- we can calmly think about how we want to move forward.I think we've made the right structural decisions over the last few years to create a very efficient P&L. We're structured to generate cash flow. We've got very stable recurring revenues. We've got flexible cost structure. I'm enthusiastic about the fact that we have a modern open platform. What we're seeing in 2020 is a major digital transformation and certainly one transformation is to work remotely via Zoom. And the other transformation is work out of the cloud. And so we're really looking at, what I'll think of is, as an explosive virtual wave of change.We\u2019re positioned well with it because our platform runs equally well on AWS or Azure, and because we support Windows and Linux, we can move seamlessly between the enterprise and the cloud and we're well positioned to bring online Google support later this year. I believe that we're going to see increasingly companies are going to want to be able to move between AWS, Azure and Google as they become more dependent upon cloud bandwidth.Our Enterprise Intelligent offering is in more demand than ever I think. Our HyperIntelligence, mobile intelligence and web intelligence, all still resonate very, very well with the marketplace. We've got a good remote delivery model. We can deliver our software remotely and have. We\u2019ve learned that we can deliver services remotely. We restructured our education fairly quickly to eliminate all of our classrooms and physical sessions and go to virtual sessions. And then we\u2019ve rebuilt our education offering so that we could offer on demand education.We lifted our limits from 20 users a class to 200 users a class. In some cases, we've been teaching 400 people in the same classroom. So we found that our education could scale nicely. We also were able to switch all of our consulting engagements from on-premises to remote fairly quickly. Probably half of them are already remote going into the COVID crisis, but the other half were able to go remote in a very quick period of time. And we were very, very impressed with the dexterity of the entire consulting team to do that.Our support and our cloud operations are performing smoothly and effectively in a remote mode. And so, as I look forward, our method for monetizing the brand is we ship software and we ship services. And if we can deliver the software, the education, the consulting and the cloud services, all in a remote model, then that puts us in good position regardless of what shape the evolving post-COVID world takes.We also have seen that our agile analytics model works really, really well in this environment. We've moved through a number of very intricate corporate business reviews, and we\u2019re able to do them with a combination of Zoom calls, MicroStrategy dossiers and MicroStrategy HyperCards. And if you just put MicroStrategy dossier onto the screen in the middle of a Zoom call, you can have 12 people in 12 different locations all working at the same information. And by hovering over any particular line item, a HyperCard comes up in a split second and you're able to get the information you need at your fingertips all while zooming around anywhere. It's a really, really elegant model for running a business. It's what we -- it\u2019s a differentiator for us. We think we do it better than anybody. I think that this explosion and a demand for Zoom will end up applying really well to our actual analytics strengths. And we've learned that we can not only operate sophisticated business reviews using Zoom, plus dossiers, plus HyperCards but in many of these cases we can change the dossier construction in the 24 hours before the meeting and we can change the HyperCard within 24 hours before the meeting. So it's easy and it's fast and it's agile.This is really, really a good place to be as we look forward. More and more businesses need to find a way to operate in a virtual environment. And normally that means, how do I create something useful in a matter of hours and deploy it to people all over the world and do it with a sub-second response. And we didn't just put this together in the past few weeks, we've always been working on it for the past five years as part of MicroStrategy 2020 platform. But I think that 2020 passed a lot of operating tests with flying colors over the past month. And so we're really happy about that.Finally, of course, our biggest asset is our customer base. And we have enterprise class customers, and that includes lots of banks, healthcare companies, telcos, governments, technology companies and retailers. Some retailers are right in the thick of this crisis, the major supermarkets shipping food and they're -- essential. Other retailers in the fashion luxury segment that are a bit more hit by this. The good news is that the great majority of our customers are either critical and essential to their various economies, or they have extraordinary balance sheets. And even if they are impacted by COVID, they\u2019ll continue as going concerns and entities. So we can't assume that we won't actually suffer some compression or our customers will suffer some deleterious outcome because of the COVID crisis. But all-in-all, we feel that our customer base is better positioned than most and our business model combined with our balance sheet, combined with our product and service offering is better positioned than most to do well as we move into a virtual environment.And so with that, I think we'd be happy to take questions from analysts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is now open.\nTyler Radke: Maybe you could start with you Phong, appreciate the color on some of the trends that you're seeing out in the field. Maybe if you could just elaborate in terms of, if there's particular verticals or a segment of customers that you're seeing those deal slippages come from, are those the same customers that you perhaps anticipate renewal rates to be pressured. And do you have any sense on when those headwinds could reverse? I am just trying to understand if you anticipate the renewal rates to be worse? Are they turning off MicroStrategy or they\u2019re just going off support? Maybe it would just be helpful to clarify that. Thanks.\nPhong Le: Hey, Tyler. Thanks for the question and I hope you're doing well too. As far as the deal slippage from Q1, as I mentioned, a lot of it happened in the last few weeks of the quarter and it wasn't necessarily any particular industry or segment. A lot of what we heard from customers who are still very interested in our software and incremental purchases was especially, hey, we're just really focused on business continuity right now, so where an IT department was ready to implement increased usage for MicroStrategy. They were now just figuring out how to make sure every one of their employees had locked laptops so they could work offline or work from home. And that isn't particularly in any industry. It was really just a lot of customers would have had to turn and focus on that sort of immediate first couple of weeks. And those cases, we're continuing those discussions now and most of them have gotten through the first two to four weeks of disruption. And I think those deal cycles are looking positive. So that's sort of the first part.On the renewal rates, I think it's early to tell. Certainly there's some impact from customers who are seeing revenues decrease in areas like travel and hospitality and restaurants and those areas. But it's not sort of a predominant case of where our customers are concentrated. Nor is it -- nor are we in a place where we can say we're predicting a trend yet. I think as we're seeing in the world and we're seeing sort of in the macroeconomic sort of environment, I think Q2 will tell us and tell a lot of our customers a lot about sort of where this is all going to go.So as I mentioned in sort of our prepared remarks, it's still early to predict how this will impact our product support revenue streams. But as Mike mentioned, I mentioned, we're well prepared to be reactive and proactive with our customers.\nTyler Radke: And just to follow up on that I guess if I look at the deferred product support revenue, I know you talked about some -- a few different dynamics in terms of invoicing and delays that wasn't sure if that was on the subscription or product support line. But with product support, deferred product support being down roughly 5 million year-over-year. Is that kind of what you're looking at in terms of the concerns of potentially seeing that the headwind itself in reported revenue or is it something in the pipeline that, that gave you the caution on the support rates?\nPhong Le: Yes, I think the only thing that you really point to as far as actual financial impacts is our product license revenue. And as I mentioned, that's because we pick up a lot of that in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. The slight decline in product support revenue was primarily related; one, to FX impact, which we continue to see some headwinds there; and two, some of that revenue moving from product support over to subscription. So nothing immediate. We definitely are having conversations, right, like even in the last few weeks with customers who are asking for delayed payment terms. We're seeing a lot of that, right? Our standard payment terms of 30 days and we have customers asking for 90 days, 180 days. And then we do have a small section of distressed customers who are asking for relief on their maintenance. So nothing sort of in the actual Q1 financials I\u2019d point to, but more conversations we're having with customers through our customer success channels and through our sales channels.\nTyler Radke: Great. And then my last question, I apologize I joined the call a couple of minutes late. But could you just talk about the CFO transition and I think that, that probably caught a lot of folks by surprise given that the short tenure that Lisa Mayr had, but what -- anything that call out there and then are there other plans to hire another full time CFO and what are your just thoughts on that transition?\nPhong Le: Nothing as far as the transition itself. Lisa, sort of resigning and going on to look for other opportunities that I think is worth expansion. I did this job six months ago for four years. I'm actually looking forward to doing it again. So fortunately for her, maybe, unfortunately for all of you, you get to talk to me again and more. And as far as our plans going forward, I don\u2019t-- we're not immediately planning on searching for a CFO. I think the nice part is as I ramped up in the second half of the last year with sales and consulting, I was able to put in a pretty strong leadership team and a deep bench. We've promoted a bunch of people from within, so I feel like the leadership and sales and consulting has really stepped up, which allows me to better split my time between finance and operations. And I'm actually really looking forward to it and hopefully you guys all are too.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Your line is now open.\nHamed Khorsand: So a few questions here. Is there any risk of less usage of customers have employees working from home? Would they need less services in consulting?\nPhong Le: Yes, a good question Hamed and it's maybe two parts. In terms of use of our software, I think the answer is no. If you look, study sort of previous downturns in the economy, we noticed that people using our software for operational purposes, especially, tends to increase, not decrease. As people work from home we'll see more of a move to the cloud. And if supply chains get more complex and I would say more scrutiny, I think our software will increase in usage too. So on a per customer basis, they're still operating. I'm not too worried there. On the consulting side, I do think when people are working from home there is less of an interest in spinning up large consulting engagements and major IT improvements and capital spend associated with consulting. We saw a little bit of that towards the end of the Q1 and we're seeing some of that in Q2. So I do expect for the period of the COVID-19 disruption, a impact on our consulting revenues.\nHamed Khorsand: And then how you\u2019re navigating this environment as far as sales goes and hitting quotas, if quotas exist at this point just given that everyone you would be targeting is working from home?\nPhong Le: It's interesting, if you'd asked me six weeks ago, I would've said we're still figuring it all out. We have fortunately been in an environment where all of our sales people generally speaking, are working remotely anyways. So it's not as if it's a major change to how they operate. The differences instead of meeting a customer in an office, in the middle of Manhattan or London or in the Bay area, they're doing it remotely via Zoom or WebEx and actually it gives them an opportunity to increase productivity so that they're not traveling three, four hours a day and they're able to meet 3 to 4x the number of customers. So we've actually seen some pleasant outcomes there. And the customers are getting used to it too.On the side of quotas, yes, when you're down 30% year-over-year in product license revenue, I think sales people look at Q1 and do worry about their ability to make money. As I sort of mentioned earlier, the pipeline is strong. And so I think people see positive outcomes as we go through the rest of the year. And our hope is that our customers start to transition from a reactionary focus on business continuity mode to a proactive take advantage of the situation and really start to invest in analytics again. And I think that'll be positive for our sales folks. So I think we'll learn a lot as to how our customers and our sales folks will react in Q2.\nHamed Khorsand: And last question, though, any upgrades gets done when companies have employees working remotely? I mean what\u2019s the enticement to do anything?\nPhong Le: That's been -- and Mike talked about it, the pleasant surprise with our business, if you will, is we gave out free education expecting maybe a few thousand customers in our sort of best case scenario to take it in over 15,000 unique customers and partners signed up for education. And what realize is while people are working from home, they actually have more time and they want to brush up on their resume and they want to brush up on their experiences.With upgrade, especially because it's free, it's the perfect substitute for capital investment, either in software or in services. And we found -- we've actually improved our ability to upgrade remotely and we're seeing good positive outcomes and upticks in upgrade activity also. So, those were, I would say, two scenarios where we actually took advantage of the current situation to give something back to our customers. And obviously, customers who get educated on MicroStrategy and upgrade to our latest platform show that they're highly engaged with our software. And when the time is right, they'll buy more education, they'll buy more services, they'll buy more software. So we've been pleased with how we've been able to pivot on that. And I think the customers see it as a very positive sort of thing for us to do in a time of need for them.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Michael Saylor for closing remarks.\nMichael Saylor: I want to thank everybody for your support over the past 12 weeks. I want to wish you all the best to come. I know it's very difficult time. We appreciate you being with us today and all the best. We'll speak with you in 12 more weeks. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Hello. This is Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman, President and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's conference call regarding our 2020 first quarter financial results. This has been quite an unusual and eventful quarter for the world; and for MicroStrategy, we're about to share an update. I will start with the change in our leadership team. Lisa Mayr has decided to resign from MicroStrategy to pursue other opportunities. We wish her well. I'm happy to announce that in her place Phong Le has agreed to resume his duties as CFO in addition to continuing his role of COO. He is here with me today and we will start by sharing our Safe Harbor notice. Thanks, Phong. Yes, as Phong said, there are challenging times, but we feel pretty good about the path ahead.

            "name": "Phong Le",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael, and good evening, everyone. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements which speak only as of today. Also during today's call we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release which was issued today and is available on our website, www.microstrategy.com.I'd like to begin by saying we hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy in this difficult time. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global emergency that's fundamentally changed our business as being done, at least in the near term. At MicroStrategy we've successfully instituted a work from home initiative for all of our employees. I am pleased that how quickly we're able to make this transition. While working from home is not a perfect substitute for our normal working environment, it does present challenges. I want to thank all MicroStrategy employees for quickly adapting to the situation and their dedication to ensuring our customers' success.Before I review our first quarter results, I want to reiterate a few key points about MicroStrategy's financial strength that we believe are particularly important in the current environment. As the management team, we will take the steps necessary to work through this economics and public health crisis, while also helping to ensure we're making the investments necessary to capitalize on our market strength.We have a strong balance sheet with more than $500 million of cash and short-term investments and no debt. MicroStrategy is a 30 year old business that has experienced tough economic cycles before. We believe our debt free balance sheet is a strategic asset for the company and provides us with significant flexibility in uncertain economic times. We have over $300 million in annualized subscription term and product support revenue. This is a stable, highly profitable source of recurring revenue for us and one of the key strengths in our financial model. We have high gross margins, a cost structure that's mostly variable or reasonably flexible and low capital investment requirements. This scalable and flexible cost structure enables us to react quickly in an uncertain environment.Today I'll provide a high level overview of our first quarter performance, how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our business, provide an update on our strategic goals for 2020, discussing product updates and finish by discussing Q1 in more detail. We were on track to have strong first quarter license revenues through the middle of March. On an average, we typically close about 50% of our license revenues in the last two weeks of each quarter.In March, we began to see some deals slippage as certain customers pulled back on investments given the high degree of uncertainty in the market as well as their need to focus on operational continuity for their employees and customers. Overall, I'd characterize our Q1 performance as reasonable given the environment at the end of the quarter. We continue to take steps to support our customers during this time and make it easier to do business with MicroStrategy.We're now providing free upgrades to the latest version of our platform MicroStrategy 2020. Over 1,000 customers are in MicroStrategy 2019 are 2020. Our customers appreciate having access to the latest software and the most comprehensive security features in MicroStrategy 2020, which help support their work from home initiatives. Proactive customer engagement is delivering good upgrade activity which we believe will help sustain high renewal rates and drive increased spend from existing customers over time.Similarly, we made our online learning portal free to use through May 15th providing our customers access to hundreds of hours of training courses, certifications, and tutorials. We've seen a tremendous response from customers and partners with nearly -- with over 15,000 unique user registrations since we announced the program. The free upgrades in education demonstrate our commitment to be a long-term partner focused on our customers' success, which we believe will benefit us in the future.Our field sales organization has quickly adapted to engaging with customers virtually. We have strategic and longstanding relationships with many of our customers, which makes it easier to engage virtually. We have also used this opportunity to simplify our sales and sales enablement processes so that we make it easier to sell our products and demonstrate a faster ROI to our customers.All of our marketing events have moved to virtual platforms. We're seeing significant benefits to this approach, including making it easier to organize and schedule customer events and being able to leverage our senior leadership and thought leaders more broadly. For example, we ran a virtual roundtable for our federal business, bringing together our best customers to discuss issues and challenges they're facing. The group was moderated by our Head of Marketing. In the past we've had two of the top three highest attended webcasts in the history of our company. This combination of strong customer interest, greater flexibility and significant cost savings encourage us to focus more on virtual marketing resources and events going forward.We continued our progress of selling our managed cloud platform in Q1 which as a reminder is at full parity to our enterprise grade on-premise product. In today's environment, businesses are looking for fast, secure and economical solutions and that is how we are positioning our product. Our customers understand that by using our managed cloud platform, they can lower total cost of ownership and get data faster and more securely.Before turning to the financials, I'd like to review the highlights from our Annual MicroStrategy World User Conference in Orlando. This is one of the best attended world events we've hosted with around 2,500 attendees. The highlight of the event was the introduction of MicroStrategy 2020, our latest platform release that builds on the tremendous innovation of MicroStrategy 2019. In particular MicroStrategy 2020 includes additional enhancements to hyperIntelligence, making it easier to gain insights from popular websites, applications and devices people use every day including Chrome, Edge and Outlook.Customers can now click on dynamic links within a HyperIntelligence card to take direct action, make it seamless for an insight interaction. We signed transactions with some great new HyperIntelligence customers including Pfizer, the General Services Administration and Nu Skin Enterprises. Customer feedback on our new innovations and product roadmap has been very positive and underscores our position as a leader in the enterprise analytics market.It's not just our customers that are recognizing the strength in the MicroStrategy platform, MicroStrategy received the highest use case scores from Gartner in the Enterprise Analytics Use Case, 4.86 out of 5 and Embedded Analytics Use Case, 4.96 out of 5 in the Gartner 2020 Critical Capabilities for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms report. We're very proud of these scores and believe our breakthrough technology of HyperIntelligence satisfies the new customer use case for speed and agility that hasn't been addressed by traditional analytics and BI tools.Turning to our financial results in more detail, revenues for the quarter were $111.4 million, down 3.4% year-over-year and 1.7% on a constant currency basis. Product license revenues were $12.6 million in Q1 2020, a $5.7 million or 31.2% decrease year-over-year and 28.2% on a constant currency basis. As discussed, we had a number of deals within a few weeks of the first quarter related to -- in the last few weeks of the first quarter related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as of the end of Q1, no major deals were lost due to COVID-19.We may experience decreased product license revenues compared to prior year periods until the effects of the pandemics has subsided. Subscription services revenue of $8 million in Q1 2020 were up 11.5% year-over-year and up 9.9% compared to the three months ending December 31, 2019. The growth of subscription services revenue reflects the growing portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform.Product support revenues were $71.2 million in Q1 2020, a slight decrease year-over-year, but 1.2% increase on a constant currency basis. Our renewal rates remained strong this quarter. Although our product support revenues were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, during Q1 2020, our product support revenues may be negatively impacted in future periods to the extent the customers require extended payment terms or determine not to renew their product support arrangements as part of their efforts to reduce expenses.Finally, you'll note that other services, which is largely our consulting services, increased 6.7% year-over-year, 8.1% on a constant currency basis. We've been delighted in our consulting organization's ability to continue to effectively deliver services remotely to our customers and we are expecting that remote delivery trend to continue. This is a great example of our operational agility and focused on serving our customers. Although our consulting revenues were not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2020, we may experience declines in our consulting revenues in future periods as our customers continue operating in remote work environments and aim to reduce expenses.Total deferred revenue and advance payments at March 31, 2020 were $188.6 million. This was down 3.1% year-over-year, but there are two factors that play here. First, there is a relatively large foreign exchange impact of 1.7%, particularly impacting our product support deferred revenue. Secondly, we had an unusually high rate of renewals in our managed cloud platform business that slipped into early April primarily due to customer administrative delays. These renewals have since closed.One other thing to note within deferred revenue, as we begin to see more existing customers convert to our managed cloud platform, there is a shift for deferred product support revenue to deferred subscription services revenue.Turning to cost, gross margin for the quarter improved slightly to 78% compared to 77.3% in the same period last year, partly due to improved consulting utilization. Total operating expenses were $87.0 million in Q1 2020, a 12.7% decrease year-over-year and down 12.4% quarter over quarter. The year-over-year cost decrease is driven by efficiency in staffing, reductions in corporate travel and a reduction in the number of in-person events, mostly related to marketing.We also had a one-time benefit from the cancellation of our sales employee awards event which was required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Driving efficiencies across the company is a key strategic focus for us and we continue to balance making investments in the business that will enhance our growth opportunities with identifying opportunities to take cost out of the business. We're confident that we can improve both top-line growth and margins over time.Turning toward our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $539 million in cash and short-term investments. You will note that during the quarter we repurchased approximately 355,000 shares of MicroStrategy class A common stock for $50.7 million. We'll continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase activity, which is one component of how we think about long-term capital allocation. As a reminder, our policy is not to discuss our buyback intention in advance.Looking ahead, the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the world. Like most companies, we're evaluating the financial impact to our business. From a demand perspective, we're seeing the positive impact from our product and go-to-market investments over the past 18 months and our pipeline for product license and cloud subscription sales.In a normalized environment I would be feeling confident in our ability to generate constant currency revenue growth. However, given the high level of uncertainty in the market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the associated economic disruption and the deal slippage we experienced at the end of March, we expect our ability to convert this pipeline to sign deals would be more challenging. Right now, there is simply a wide range of outcomes for product sales in Q2 and the balance of the year. We also expect to see some modest headwinds to our product support and consulting revenues over the rest of the year. We have a highly diverse customer base and consistently high renewal rates.We do have some customers with extreme challenges in their business that we believe may lead to some payment lapses or delays leading to some pressure on renewal rates. We are expecting some pressure on consulting revenues as some customers look at ways to reduce spending to manage their near term expenses.With regard to expenses, as we discussed last quarter, we believe we have right-sized the organization to allow us to continue to invest in our business. Our prior initiatives, including driving greater productivity in sales are moving some of our R&D and overhead functions to lower cost locations.Now, with the recent changes to our marketing programs and reductions in travel, we believe we have the ability to offset a potential drop in revenues. Our objective is to deliver positive operating margin and positive free cash flow in 2020.Now, I'd like to turn it back to Michael Saylor. Hey, Tyler. Thanks for the question and I hope you're doing well too. As far as the deal slippage from Q1, as I mentioned, a lot of it happened in the last few weeks of the quarter and it wasn't necessarily any particular industry or segment. A lot of what we heard from customers who are still very interested in our software and incremental purchases was especially, hey, we're just really focused on business continuity right now, so where an IT department was ready to implement increased usage for MicroStrategy. They were now just figuring out how to make sure every one of their employees had locked laptops so they could work offline or work from home. And that isn't particularly in any industry. It was really just a lot of customers would have had to turn and focus on that sort of immediate first couple of weeks. And those cases, we're continuing those discussions now and most of them have gotten through the first two to four weeks of disruption. And I think those deal cycles are looking positive. So that's sort of the first part.On the renewal rates, I think it's early to tell. Certainly there's some impact from customers who are seeing revenues decrease in areas like travel and hospitality and restaurants and those areas. But it's not sort of a predominant case of where our customers are concentrated. Nor is it -- nor are we in a place where we can say we're predicting a trend yet. I think as we're seeing in the world and we're seeing sort of in the macroeconomic sort of environment, I think Q2 will tell us and tell a lot of our customers a lot about sort of where this is all going to go.So as I mentioned in sort of our prepared remarks, it's still early to predict how this will impact our product support revenue streams. But as Mike mentioned, I mentioned, we're well prepared to be reactive and proactive with our customers. Yes, I think the only thing that you really point to as far as actual financial impacts is our product license revenue. And as I mentioned, that's because we pick up a lot of that in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. The slight decline in product support revenue was primarily related; one, to FX impact, which we continue to see some headwinds there; and two, some of that revenue moving from product support over to subscription. So nothing immediate. We definitely are having conversations, right, like even in the last few weeks with customers who are asking for delayed payment terms. We're seeing a lot of that, right? Our standard payment terms of 30 days and we have customers asking for 90 days, 180 days. And then we do have a small section of distressed customers who are asking for relief on their maintenance. So nothing sort of in the actual Q1 financials I'd point to, but more conversations we're having with customers through our customer success channels and through our sales channels. Nothing as far as the transition itself. Lisa, sort of resigning and going on to look for other opportunities that I think is worth expansion. I did this job six months ago for four years. I'm actually looking forward to doing it again. So fortunately for her, maybe, unfortunately for all of you, you get to talk to me again and more. And as far as our plans going forward, I don't-- we're not immediately planning on searching for a CFO. I think the nice part is as I ramped up in the second half of the last year with sales and consulting, I was able to put in a pretty strong leadership team and a deep bench. We've promoted a bunch of people from within, so I feel like the leadership and sales and consulting has really stepped up, which allows me to better split my time between finance and operations. And I'm actually really looking forward to it and hopefully you guys all are too. Yes, a good question Hamed and it's maybe two parts. In terms of use of our software, I think the answer is no. If you look, study sort of previous downturns in the economy, we noticed that people using our software for operational purposes, especially, tends to increase, not decrease. As people work from home we'll see more of a move to the cloud. And if supply chains get more complex and I would say more scrutiny, I think our software will increase in usage too. So on a per customer basis, they're still operating. I'm not too worried there. On the consulting side, I do think when people are working from home there is less of an interest in spinning up large consulting engagements and major IT improvements and capital spend associated with consulting. We saw a little bit of that towards the end of the Q1 and we're seeing some of that in Q2. So I do expect for the period of the COVID-19 disruption, a impact on our consulting revenues. It's interesting, if you'd asked me six weeks ago, I would've said we're still figuring it all out. We have fortunately been in an environment where all of our sales people generally speaking, are working remotely anyways. So it's not as if it's a major change to how they operate. The differences instead of meeting a customer in an office, in the middle of Manhattan or London or in the Bay area, they're doing it remotely via Zoom or WebEx and actually it gives them an opportunity to increase productivity so that they're not traveling three, four hours a day and they're able to meet 3 to 4x the number of customers. So we've actually seen some pleasant outcomes there. And the customers are getting used to it too.On the side of quotas, yes, when you're down 30% year-over-year in product license revenue, I think sales people look at Q1 and do worry about their ability to make money. As I sort of mentioned earlier, the pipeline is strong. And so I think people see positive outcomes as we go through the rest of the year. And our hope is that our customers start to transition from a reactionary focus on business continuity mode to a proactive take advantage of the situation and really start to invest in analytics again. And I think that'll be positive for our sales folks. So I think we'll learn a lot as to how our customers and our sales folks will react in Q2. That's been -- and Mike talked about it, the pleasant surprise with our business, if you will, is we gave out free education expecting maybe a few thousand customers in our sort of best case scenario to take it in over 15,000 unique customers and partners signed up for education. And what realize is while people are working from home, they actually have more time and they want to brush up on their resume and they want to brush up on their experiences.With upgrade, especially because it's free, it's the perfect substitute for capital investment, either in software or in services. And we found -- we've actually improved our ability to upgrade remotely and we're seeing good positive outcomes and upticks in upgrade activity also. So, those were, I would say, two scenarios where we actually took advantage of the current situation to give something back to our customers. And obviously, customers who get educated on MicroStrategy and upgrade to our latest platform show that they're highly engaged with our software. And when the time is right, they'll buy more education, they'll buy more services, they'll buy more software. So we've been pleased with how we've been able to pivot on that. And I think the customers see it as a very positive sort of thing for us to do in a time of need for them."

I'll be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2021 Fourth Quarter Earnings webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various factors -- important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at www.microstrategy.com.  With that, I will turn the call over to Michael Saylor, Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. Michael?\nMichael Saylor : Thank you, Shirish. I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2021 fourth quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who's going to provide an update on our operations and the financials for the quarter.\nPhong Le : Thank you, Michael. I'd like to start off with an update on our successful day 1 of our MicroStrategy World 2022 event today. We had 2 parallel tracks. The first was the enterprise analytics track featuring discussions with industry leaders, including Nice, Sainsbury's and the Schwarz Group about why the MicroStrategy platform is their tool of choice for the enterprise for cloud-powered analytics and for OEMs. And the second track was Bitcoin for Corporations, featuring Jack Dorsey, CEO, Chairman and Co-Founder of Block as the keynote speaker. This is our second annual Bitcoin for Corporations event, where we present our playbook to other corporates who are looking to explore how Bitcoin can provide an innovative treasury and product strategy. We had an amazing turnout with over 28,000 attendees viewing the event live worldwide. Replays for today's session will be available on our website. As a reminder, MicroStrategy World 2022 is 100% virtual and free of cost. So please feel free to register and tune in to the second and final day of the event tomorrow. Now turning to our results. The fourth quarter was a good finish to what was an exciting and transformational year for MicroStrategy. Before I review our fourth quarter results in detail, I want to underscore the key highlights from 2021 for the company. First, we had a solid sales year, returning to positive year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since 2014. Total revenue for 2021 was $510.8 million, up 6.2% versus 2020. Product license revenues for the year was up 17%, growing for the first time since 2013. And subscription revenue was up 30% versus the full year 2020. The focus on term license sales contributed to the material growth in license revenue and subscription revenue. We also made important progress in our shift towards our cloud offering, which drove annual subscription billings up 39% year-over-year to $55.4 million as of year-end 2021, which is the highest level in our history. Second, on our balance sheet. Our pioneering decision to make Bitcoin our primary treasury reserve asset has made MicroStrategy a thought leader in the cryptocurrency market and generated great interest in MicroStrategy as a corporation. In 2021, we added a total of 53,922 Bitcoins to our balance sheet at an average price of $48,710 per bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. We believe that our brand value has benefited significantly because of our investment in Bitcoin. We believe that such market attention, when captured correctly, has helped to create software pipeline growth and sales growth. Thus, we believe our 2 corporate strategies are synergistic to each other, creating a virtuous flywheel. Our performance in 2021 is indicative of the multiple ways MicroStrategy is able to create meaningful value for our shareholders. Moreover, our strategy has also benefited our employees and increased general pride in our organization. As a result, we have seen improvement in our employee retention rates and ability to attract and retain top talent. Turning to our fourth quarter results. We're pleased with our performance in this quarter across both of our corporate strategies. For the sixth straight quarter, we posted strong financial and operational results for our software business and made incremental investments in Bitcoin. Our Enterprise Analytics business delivered another strong quarter, and we've seen increased adoption of the MicroStrategy platform, especially in the cloud by new and existing customers. We had another active quarter with our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, executing another successful capital raise through our at-the-market offering under our open market sale agreement and expanding our digital asset holdings. Total revenue in the quarter grew 2.4% year-over-year or 4.4% on a constant currency basis to $134.5 million. Product license revenues was up 9% year-over-year or 13% on a constant currency basis. Subscription revenue was up 35% year-over-year, also 35% on a constant currency basis. And current subscription billings grew 53% year-over-year, our seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth to $24.3 million. Before turning to our financial results in greater detail, I'd like to reiterate some of the key takeaways from the Investor Day we held in December. We are as excited as we have ever been about the opportunities that lie ahead for MicroStrategy. We are targeting a multibillion-dollar market opportunity that is at an early stage of moving off of legacy technology and to the cloud. We're well positioned to meet the demands of enterprise customers with our modern analytics platform, and we're targeting 3 key areas of growth. First, enterprise analytics. Our platform is expressly designed to address the needs of large corporations looking for analytics to unlock the power of their data and create value for their internal users and external stakeholders. We're replacing and consolidating legacy and departmental analytics use cases because of our full-scale enterprise capabilities. A great example of enterprise analytics in action is at the Schwarz Group, the fourth largest retailer in the world with worldwide brands, including Lidl and Kaufland. As they discussed at our MicroStrategy World event today, they have tens of thousands of users leveraging MicroStrategy reports on web and mobile in more than 30 countries. They've also adapted dossier for self-service BI, and hundreds of reports have been created by their power users to serve data analytics needs across their business all based on that same single version of the truth they've established with MicroStrategy. These solutions are used by team members in individual stores all the way up to their international Board of Directors. Second, OEM. We're number one in the market in our embedded OEM business. MicroStrategy is well positioned to further benefit from the trend in the embedded analytics and OEM marketplace where enterprises are now buying and not building analytics. We offer streamlined and differentiated developer-focused solutions for OEMs and technology companies. We believe our extensive investment in an open architecture driven by open APIs and SDKs provides OEMs with the best solution in the market. And we believe by targeting this market, we can grow our market share. Nice is the world's leading provider of cloud-native customer experience management and optimization software and a major OEM customer. They embed MicroStrategy into their entire solution suite because they like the scalability and sophistication it provides and they recognize we're a reliable partner. As I shared at World today, such adoption allowed them to get to market faster and to operate at the global scale they need, serving 125,000 organizations over 150 countries. They also discussed why they chose MicroStrategy in a competitive field. We align with their native cloud architecture, their data model, their modern user experience, and we share the same approach to our technology as they do in terms of velocity, openness and innovation. Beyond the technical benefits, they also value our partnership, and they've heard from their customers that the data and analytics visualization achieved within  using MicroStrategy is out of this world. The third focus area is cloud. We offer an innovative enterprise analytics solution in the cloud, combining app-parity capabilities with our leading on-premise solution with strong security and cloud practices, reducing operational complexity and cost for our customers. We expect to grow by migrating on-premise customers, expanding existing cloud customers and defaulting new customers to the cloud. Sainsbury's, one of the largest retail chains in the U.K., replaced various legacy analytics tools with MicroStrategy Cloud as the enterprise standard. Today, they have a suite of over 30 applications, delivering data-driven insights to 12,000-plus users across their organization. In every 1 of their over 1,400 stores, their colleagues leveraged several applications on mobile devices for various functions so that they can maximize the time they spend on the store serving floor customers -- on the store floor serving customers. And that spans across all aspects of their organization right up to the C-suite. This is all built on 3 complementary cloud technologies, AWS, Snowflake and MicroStrategy as the analytics delivery mechanism for their entire business. MicroStrategy Cloud has continued to perform -- to become a growing mix of our business, while our on-prem product has continued to perform well. We had great subscription billings momentum in Q4 2021, and we seek to accelerate this momentum in 2022. We're committed to meeting the needs of our customers regardless of how they would like to deploy MicroStrategy, some of whom operate in highly regulated industries or countries where cloud deployment is not feasible. When you look at the overall growth of our subscription and license business, it is clear that underlying demand for our platform has demonstrated signs of strength. We believe that our pace of innovation is as impressive now as it has been in many years, with the company now producing quarterly and monthly software updates. Our team has rolled out a robust set of product features and enhancements that we believe will expand the value we provide customers and represent future incremental growth opportunities. We recently released our most secure, performant and innovative platform version ever, purpose-built to meet the most challenging and sophisticated needs of our user base. We've delivered low-code/no-code technologies that permit users to fully implement -- to implement fully functional analytics applications with a fantastic UI/UX, lowering the learning curve to deploy compelling interactive analytics solutions across the enterprise. We've also continued to invest in HyperIntelligence, our zero-click analytics product designed to deliver in-context insights to anyone, anywhere. Finally, this year, we rolled out a fully modernized reference architecture based on containers and microservices. This architecture is built to deliver scalable, multi-tenant SaaS solutions across tens of thousands of users and provide developers with a streamlined experience to leverage continuous integration and continuous deployment. Overall, I'm very pleased with the pace of product innovation and the way our analytics business is performing. We have shown consistent growth, and we're confident in our ability to achieve long-term growth targets while maintaining profitability. Turning now to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We had another active and successful quarter. We raised approximately $596 million in capital through the sale of Class A common shares as part of our at-the-market offering during the quarter. We used the net proceeds from this offering to purchase an additional 10,349 Bitcoins at an average price of $57,113 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. This is the fourth successful capital raise we have done in the past year, having raised $2.6 billion of new debt and equity capital that we have deployed in support of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. As of December 31, 2021, we've reached the maximum program amount of $1 billion under our existing ATM facility, which we used in Q3 and Q4 to issue around 1.4 million shares at a weighted average stock price of approximately $707 to purchase a total of 18,863 Bitcoin. As of December 31, 2021, MicroStrategy own 124,391 Bitcoins that we acquired for a total of $3.75 billion or $30,159 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. The market value of our Bitcoin holdings was $5.7 billion at December 31, 2021, reflecting approximately $2 billion of unrealized gains or approximately 50% appreciation when compared to the original cost basis of our Bitcoin at December 31, 2021. The book value of our Bitcoin holdings was roughly $2.9 billion. This morning, we announced that we acquired an additional 660 Bitcoins for $25 million using our excess cash at an average price of approximately $37,865 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. As of yesterday, January 31, 2022, we hold approximately 125,051 Bitcoins. They required an aggregate purchase price of $3.78 billion at an average purchase price of $30,200 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. As of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time yesterday, the market price of 1 Bitcoin in our principal market was $38,450, which equates to a market value roughly $4.8 billion. MicroStrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of an enterprise's treasury policies, generating incremental value to our shareholders and, in doing so, established itself as the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. Currently, our MacroStrategy subsidiary holds over 110,000 Bitcoins that are not pledged as collateral under our senior secured notes. We may consider additional opportunities that utilize this strategic asset to acquire more capital to deploy towards our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. This may include vehicles such as Bitcoin-backed bonds or loaning out our Bitcoin to seek to generate yield. We have not targeted any specific course of action at this point and may ultimately decide not to pursue any of these paths. Turning to our fourth quarter 2021 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $134.5 million, up 2% -- 2.4% year-over-year or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Product license revenues were $32.5 million in the fourth quarter 2021, up 9% year-over-year or 13% on a constant currency basis. Subscription services revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $11.8 million, an increase of 35% year-over-year, also 35% on a constant currency basis. The growth in subscription services revenues reflects the increased portion of our product bookings that were related to our managed cloud platform. The current subscription billings in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $24.3 million, an increase of 53% year-over-year. We are pleased with the performance of our cloud business in the fourth quarter, and we'll look for growth to continue to accelerate. Product support revenues were $69.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of 4% year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by certain existing customers converting from perpetual product licenses to our subscription services or term license offerings. As we see more on-premise conversions to our cloud offering, we would anticipate product support revenue will experience a modest decline over time. Finally, our other services revenue, which largely reflects our consulting services, were $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, staying largely flat with a modest increase of 0.5% year-over-year or 2% on a constant currency basis. We believe that stability of consulting revenues is an indication of continued engagement from our customers to modernize and retain deployment of their MicroStrategy platform. Now I'll elaborate on our recent responses on the SEC comment letter dated December 16, 2021. As required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC undertakes some level of review of each reporting company at least once every 3 years and reviews a significant number of companies more frequently. The SEC staff frequently provides comments where the staff believes the company can enhance its disclosures. As part of our recent review by the SEC, MicroStrategy engaged in a routine exchange of comment and response letters with the SEC -- with the SEC staff. In that exchange, we discussed with them whether to include adjustments related to Bitcoin impairment losses in our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. We agreed with them that on a going-forward basis, any non-GAAP financial measures we may present in future filings should retain the impact from Bitcoin impairment losses. This change in the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures does not impact our strategy, operations or GAAP financial statements or previous SEC filings. As something of a pioneer in the Bitcoin space, we have faced some uncertainty regarding the disclosure requirements and non-GAAP presentation as they relate to Bitcoin. And I appreciate the clarity that engaging in that comment process with the SEC staff has provided us. As a reminder, our Bitcoin holdings are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in their fair value below our book value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we incurred digital asset impairment charges of $147 million. Shifting to our cost, total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expenses, were $259 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP cost of revenues was $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $2.4 million or 12% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 1.4%, driven by increases in cloud customer hosting fees and personnel costs from additional head count. As we continue to accelerate our shift to cloud, we expect increases in infrastructure costs and head count to support additional customers. Over time, our cloud business -- over time, we expect our cloud business to scale, decreasing costs as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $40 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in sales compensation from improved bookings performance. However, as a percentage of product license and subscription revenue, this reflects a decrease of 10%, indicating improved productivity of our sales and marketing teams. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $28 million, an increase of $3.6 million or 15% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 2.3%, driven by head count increases, cost of hiring and wage inflation. The technology sector has experienced significant wage inflation and competition for resources, and we anticipate that trend will continue in 2022 and that we will continue to invest in additional R&D head count and work to retain our talented engineers and continue to provide a best-in-class product. Non-GAAP G&A expense was $22 million, an increase of $3.8 million or 21% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 2.5%, driven primarily by an increase of Bitcoin-related fees, including custody, legal, audit and other consulting fees related to executing our Bitcoin strategy. Overall, we feel comfortable with our cost structure and our ability to generate cash flow sustainably. Total non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $124.3 million, inclusive of an impairment charge related to Bitcoin of $146.6 million. As discussed, going forward, we will no longer adjust for the impairment charges related to Bitcoin in our non-GAAP metrics. We will continue to report the Bitcoin impairment charges separately. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $63 million in cash. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of December 31, 2021, was $2.9 billion, which reflects $901 million in cumulative impairment charges that have also been reflected as losses on our GAAP income statements in the periods occurred. Our noncash Bitcoin impairment charges will remain subject to market volatility of Bitcoin prices. Given the significant drop in the market price of Bitcoin in January 2022, we will recognize significant impairment charges again in the first quarter of 2022. As one of the leading advocates for digital assets, we've been working with peer companies and various policy-setting agencies in the U.S. to try to determine a more appropriate accounting framework for digital assets. In Q3 2021, we wrote to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, that the disconnect between an entity's financial statements and the economic reality of its financial condition and results of operations fails to provide investors, analysts and the general public with the information they need to make an informed assessment of an entity's current and future prospects. Currently, companies that aren't investment companies report Bitcoin as intangible assets. This means Bitcoin gets initially recorded on balance sheets at its historic cost and then is deemed impaired at the market value every dip. However, the carry value can never conversely be revised upward if the price of Bitcoin increases. In Q4, the FASB announced that they have added a project to their research agenda to explore accounting for exchange-traded digital assets. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, we believe we have a responsibility to share what we've learned since embarking on this strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this new asset class. Next, I would like to emphasize the strength of our robust capital structure. From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we are insulated from the near-term volatility of Bitcoin prices since we currently do not have any debt principal maturities coming due until December 2025. Our 0.75% senior convertible notes due 2025 are convertible into our Class A shares at an initial conversion price of $398 per share and mature in December 2025. Our 0% senior convertible notes are convertible into our Class A shares at an initial conversion price of $1,432 per share and mature in February 2027. Our 6.125% senior secured notes currently mature in June 2028, subject to a springing maturity feature. Regarding the interest payments on these instruments, we have comfortable levels of excess cash flows generated through our software business to cover the interest as it becomes accrued and are payable. Additionally, we maintain a certain minimum amount of cash balance to fund our regular working capital needs. Moving to our cash flow trajectory. If we consider non-GAAP free cash flow, which is defined as our GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures related to investing activities, our annual non-GAAP free cash flow has grown over the last 3 years to $91 million in 2021. Correspondingly, our non-GAAP free cash flow margin has also improved over the last 3 years, reaching approximately 18% in 2021. We benefited from improving revenues from ongoing product innovations, improved sales and marketing execution as well as an improved cost structure, benefiting from our early embrace of the virtual wave. Our 2022 outlook remains positive with our continued transition to cloud and our expectation of a sustained increase in subscription billings. Our cloud transition will result in increased cloud billings and subscription billings. With the growth of our subscription billings in Q4 2021, it's possible that our product license revenue and total revenue growth in 2021 will decelerate even as our overall software business expands. This will depend largely on the mix of new sales between cloud and on-premise licenses. This is because of a new cloud contract, which may have a higher total contract value than an on-premise license, still results in lower recognized revenue in the first year. The lower revenue may also cause a short-term decline in profitability due to the revenue J curve, which will more than normalize in the long term. Overall, we feel we're well positioned to achieve our long-term growth sales target of greater than 10% and increased free cash flow targets over time. Finally, in my role as President of MicroStrategy, I've held the Head of Worldwide Sales role for the past 1.5 years and the CFO role for nearly all of the past 6 years. To support our growth and allow me time to focus more on corporate strategy and day-to-day operations, we announced that we're looking to hire a full-time CFO. We're still in the process of that search. In addition, we've also been looking for a dedicated leader of worldwide sales and have found that person. We're excited to announce the recent internal promotion of Kevin Adkisson to our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer position. Kevin joined MicroStrategy in October 2016 as a sales leader in our central business and has been promoted several times since then due to his outstanding sales results as well as his ability to hire, develop and inspire a high-performing team. Kevin is known for his track record of success and is instrumental in our transition to the cloud. I look forward to having more time to focus on my role as President, running the day-to-day business of MicroStrategy as well as strategically planning for our long-term health and growth. I'll now turn over the call to Michael for comments on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy as well as market trends for business intelligence software.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Phong. I will just comment on our business strategy. We have 2, our business intelligence strategy and our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. With regard to business intelligence, our path forward is to continue to improve the product to rotate our revenues from enterprise-software-based to cloud-based. And to general -- to continue to grow our installed base, we had 6% top line growth last year. That was awesome. I expect we'll continue to grow the business either by taking advantage of special marketing opportunities that our brand brings us for sales activity. And then we will continue to refine and automate the processes with which we provide our products and our services to our customers. So that's a mature but balanced, well-understood enterprise software business, and it's generating excellent free cash flows for us, cash flows in excess of what we need to reinvest in order to grow the business. So that leads us to our second strategy, which is Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We're going to continue to reinvest our free cash flows from the core business into Bitcoin. This morning, we announced we'd acquired $25 million worth of additional Bitcoin from free cash flow. I think that's a powerful strategy for us, and it's working well. Obviously, we'll hold the existing Bitcoin. We've crossed 125,000 Bitcoin now. And as Phong had pointed out, much of that Bitcoin is not pledged as collateral. So the company maintains options that we can consider, and we'll consider different options from time to time to put more leverage on that collateral or to generate yield on those assets if we find a compelling opportunity that we feel would be accretive and appropriate to our risk parameters. As Phong has said, we haven't really decided anything and we don't have any particular intent right now. But the option to pursue either leverage or yield or other kinds of strategic partnerships using our billions of dollars of Bitcoin, I think, is very important and it's an important benefit to our shareholders. And it's a way in which we will look to build shareholder value. When you're considering MicroStrategy, clearly, you can look at us as a software company. And I think people are going to evaluate our revenue growth rate. They're going to look at our ability to generate free cash flow, our efficiency. And they're going to also look at our progress in migrating to a cloud-first business model. And right now, we've got a very rapid growth rate to the cloud. So we're very pleased about that. When considering the Bitcoin MicroStrategy side of the business, I think that investors will compare us to ETFs or other sorts of Bitcoin operating companies. And I think investors understand if they invest a certain sum of money in an ETF, which is futures-based, there's a substantial cost each year in excess of 2% and potentially much, much higher to roll over the futures. And so holding a spot ETF would be more desirable than our futures ETF if you're concerned about the carrying cost over the course of a decade or even a year. There is no spot ETF available for Bitcoin right now, which means that current investors can compare us to, say, a gray-scale product, which has a multi-percent yield -- sorry, multi-percent cost, 2% or slightly more than that. If there ever is a Bitcoin spot market ETF, it would be 50 to 100 basis points cost annually for investors. MicroStrategy is in a fortunate situation because we are an operating company that generates free cash flow. And so rather than paying 1% of your Bitcoin per year or a 1% fee to hold it, we're actually acquiring Bitcoin via free cash flow from time to time. And so if you compare us to various spot and futures ETFs, I think we compare very favorably because we are an efficient operating company. If you compare us to other operating companies in the Bitcoin space, we're not a Bitcoin miner. So we don't have the same kind of capital obligations or competitive uncertainties that a Bitcoin miner has. And I think that if you are an investor in Bitcoin miners, then of course, it's reasonable to invest in them. But if you're looking for an operating company that's going to acquire more Bitcoin that isn't subject to the competitive and uncertain dynamics of the mining business, then MicroStrategy is a fairly unique player in the space. So we feel that our Bitcoin strategy is really accretive to our business intelligence strategy. And our business intelligence strategy is very accretive, very beneficial to our Bitcoin strategy. And it's worked together well. I think it's elevated our brand. It's opened up new sales opportunities for us, new marketing opportunities for us. And of course, being able to channel our proceeds from our software business into the Bitcoin strategy, I think, is a great opportunity and we'll pursue that. With regard to the outlook to Bitcoin, I think that in the last 12 months, the asset classes has evolved and matured. I see evidence of a lot more institutional adoption, greater adoption amongst macro and other hedge funds. We've made great progress with corporations. There will be 24 publicly traded Bitcoin miners by the end of the quarter, so lots of publicly traded companies in the Bitcoin space, more and more publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, more and more public investors with Bitcoin exposure, more banks rolling out Bitcoin acquisition and trading and custody services, more regulatory awareness and more clarity as to how the entire crypto industry is going to evolve. I think these are all good things for the asset class and they're positive developments. In the rest of the world, many of the macroeconomic developments have elevated the stature and the awareness of businesses and investors in the rest of the world to Bitcoin. The circumstances and the currency volatility in Turkey, the currency volatility in South America, the currency volatility in Africa, all of these things have elevated institutional awareness of Bitcoin. Of late in the past month, the capital markets volatility, the volatility of equities, the S&P Index, the volatility of NASDAQ, of big tech stocks, all of these things have elevated mainstream investors' awareness to Bitcoin. And there's a growing sentiment that we see across the mainstream that Bitcoin is here to stay. The crypto economy represents a great opportunity for the entire world. And politicians and investors and corporations are working diligently to come to terms on what this means and how they should adjust their practices. I see all these things as very positive steps forward versus where we were a year ago. I'm really hard-pressed to think of any material developments in the past 12 months that are putting us at a disadvantaged situation versus a year ago. I think generally, we've had a passage of positive developments. And we look forward to the next wave of institutional adoption that, I think, should be driven as people get more educated and more aware of what digital property is. And as all of the various vendors in the space, all enhance their product offerings and their service offerings in order to make adoption of digital assets and Bitcoin in specific easier. So with that, I think we're ready to go on to questions and answers, if we have questions from the analysts and investment community, Shirish?\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Okay. Great. Thank you, Michael. We are going to jump right into questions. We have a lot of good questions. First question is for Phong. Could you comment on the strength seen in total billings growth this quarter? Did you see any benefit from early renewals this quarter?\nMichael Saylor: You're on mute.\nPhong Le: The short answer is no. I think we\u2019re seeing an acceleration of our software business. We saw it throughout the course of 2021, benefiting from our most recent product cycle, increased demand in the general market, and also, I think some \u2013 the flywheel effect I talked about from our Bitcoin strategy. So no, we\u2019re not seeing an acceleration of billings from 2022 to 2021. I think we are seeing general growth.\nShirish Jajodia: Okay. Another question for Phong. Non-GAAP operating margin, excluding the Bitcoin impairment, was slightly lower this quarter at 16.6%. What were the areas of investment this quarter? And how do you think about margins going forward we'll continue to see next year?\nPhong Le : Yes, I\u2019d say there are 3 areas where we saw some margin dilution in the fourth quarter. The first is in our cloud business, we are starting to ramp up the team in anticipation, as you saw with our cloud billings of significant growth. So as that cloud business starts to scale, that margin dilution, I think, will reduce. And so that\u2019s area #1. Area #2 is related to R&D. We\u2019ll continue to invest in our technology team, more folks around the world. And as probably as well-known at this point in time, there is a lot of wage inflation and a very competitive marketplace for technology resources. And so to make sure we have the right team in place and we retain folks, we will see some wage increases there. I expect that portion in terms of margin dilution will continue for the near future. And then the third area that we saw some margin dilution is in our G&A costs as it relates to our Bitcoin strategy. So fees, custody fees, some onetime costs related to consulting fees, advisory fees, legal fees, that should reduce its dilution over time, too. So those are the 3 areas. And I do recognize the cost structure went up a little bit in Q4, but I think long term, we still expect our margins to be accretive as a business as we grow.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Phong. Next question is for Michael. Financial services infrastructure on the digital assets industry continues to quickly evolve. How do you view the opportunities to exploit your large Bitcoin balance in 2022 to drive shareholder value beyond spot appreciation this year versus last year and perhaps a new generation or other strategies?\nMichael Saylor: I think that as enthusiasm to trade and hold and bank digital assets and Bitcoin in particular grows, there are going to be \u2013 there\u2019s going to be an increase in the number of creditworthy counterparties that we could do business with and increasing the options that we have. So we have a large amount of assets. So in theory, we could lend them out for yield. 2 years ago, there weren\u2019t that many counterparties and there were no, say, FDIC-insured banks that might want to borrow and give us yield. But I think that as FDIC-insured banks get into the space, and it seems like it\u2019s just a matter of time before they do get into the space and as very large $1 trillion balance sheet entities get in the space, we\u2019ll have a much deeper selection of counterparties that we might work with to either borrow from or generate yield from either of those or \u2013 and/or maybe generate some yield on our own through selling volatility. I think all of these options that we have, they all come with a risk \u2013 a counterparty risk and they come with a theoretical opportunity cost. And then they also come with an execution cost and a whole set of compliance and other sorts of disclosure issues and strategy issues that we consider. So we\u2019ll parse the opportunities carefully as they evolve. But certainly, in a world where, say, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, Bank of America and Citigroup and JPMorgan are interested and involved in the space, then I think the options that will be available to us over time will be greater. And the counterparty risk that we would have to incur will be less \u2013 and I think that \u2013 that\u2019s part of the maturing of the market, which will be good for everybody in it.\nShirish Jajodia: And a follow-up on that, can you quantify how much more balance sheet capacity you have left right now and outside of further equity issuance to acquire more Bitcoin, considering both the core business and the MicroStrategy subsidiary?\nMichael Saylor: I think the most important number to focus on is the amount of Bitcoin that we have that is not pledged as collateral, which I think Phong pointed out. What was it, Phong, 110,000 or so?\nPhong Le: Yes, 110,000, exactly.\nMichael Saylor: So 110,000 Bitcoin would be the asset that is not pledged as collateral that we could potentially consider using either to generate yield or to leverage.\nShirish Jajodia: We'll turn over to Phong now. Congratulations on the strong year. Should we expect any changes to the go-to-market process given the new head of sales?\nPhong Le: Well, thank you. No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to \u2013 we would expect a lot of major changes. Kevin has been with the company 5 years now. He was instrumental to some of the changes that we made in 2020. As we embraced the virtual wave and went more to digital marketing, obviously, less in-person events, less in-person \u2013 fewer in-person meetings and also really moving to the cloud. So I think it\u2019s an acceleration of those elements and better and better sales adoption and customer adoption of those strategies. But I don\u2019t think we have any major fundamental changes planned in the short term.\nShirish Jajodia: Another one for Phong. You have set a long-term target at the Investor Day to grow revenue more than 10% annually. What are some of the levers you can pull to get to this growth rate? And what's the -- and how is the timing impacted by the cloud transition?\nPhong Le: It\u2019s a couple of things. First of all, if you see our product license revenue growth last year, 17% constant currency, subscription billings growth last year, 35% roughly, you combine those 2, those are really the foundational elements of growing the overall business. Product license revenue growth drives support revenue. Subscription revenue growth drives more cloud and more high-quality recurring revenue. So I think if you see those levels of growth, that should lead to greater than 10% revenue growth over time. We have a shift of decrease in support revenue, and it\u2019s a large amount, but the other pieces should outweigh that. And then our consulting business continues to chug along, and it should grow sort of at the level that you see the product piece is growing. I put all of that together. I think 10% is very achievable. There \u2013 it could be slightly depressed this year as we really rapidly accelerate to cloud. But I don\u2019t see that to be a long-term drag on our revenue growth potential.\nShirish Jajodia: Okay. Switching to Michael now. Can you speak about the issuance of additional stock at the market to purchase Bitcoin and if it is accretive? Additionally, can you also talk about the ability to pay the interest on bond offerings from cash flows of current MicroStrategy business intelligence arm?\nMichael Saylor: Yes. So regarding the first question, we wouldn\u2019t choose to issue stock if we didn\u2019t think it was accretive. And whether it\u2019s accretive or not depends on a variety of circumstances and \u2013 facts and circumstances. But we\u2019re certainly not going to issue stock if we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s accretive. Regarding to the second question, we have free cash flow in excess of the debt service and the interest on the debt, and we\u2019re comfortable that we can cover the interest on our debt from our free cash flows.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you. Turning to Phong. Could you talk about how far along in the cloud migration journey we are at currently? And are you seeing larger customers migrate? Or are they still waiting for more enhancements in the cloud product?\nPhong Le: Yes. So we saw for the full year of 2021, 35% growth in our cloud billings. In the fourth quarter, we saw it at 53%. And I think as we get into 2022, that number could further accelerate. And today at least, that is on the back of some medium-sized and sort of a few large customers. I do think we will start to see that trend more and more towards large customers in 2022. I think there is a comfort for large customers to move to the cloud more so in the next year or so, and then it\u2019s just a process, right? It takes longer for a large customer to go through the cloud migration process. But I would say as we enter 2022, we\u2019re sort of right in the meat of really starting to accelerate that cloud migration journey, which is exciting. We\u2019ve done a lot of work on our product and on our processes and our operations to be prepared for that.\nShirish Jajodia: Okay. Let's switch to Michael. Can you elaborate on what are your plans for Bitcoin for Corporations and whether this will have a revenue benefit for MicroStrategy?\nMichael Saylor: Well, this is our second annual Bitcoin for corporations conference. We kicked it off last year. To my knowledge, this has like been the primary, if not one of the fewer or the only Bitcoin-related conference, focused upon corporate adoption of Bitcoin as opposed to institutional investors or retail investors or technology or some other audience. We expect to continue to do the conference annually. We found that annual is good cadence. Our goal is to educate corporations on the benefits of Bitcoin and then the mechanics and the other nuances of integrating Bitcoin into their products or their services or their balance sheet. And there are going to be new developments every year. So I think that we\u2019ll want to do a refresher each year, and we try to curate a set of institutional-grade vendors that can help with things like commercial banking a Bitcoin or investment banking Bitcoin companies or payments on Bitcoin rails or exchange trading Bitcoin or custody of Bitcoin. So we feel like it\u2019s been good for our brand. It\u2019s helped in our \u2013 it\u2019s improved our marketing reach. We don\u2019t see it as a revenue generator per se. We don\u2019t have any intentions to monetize the event now or in the future. We\u2019re primarily providing this as an educational service to the general public because we believe it\u2019s in the best interest of the industry. To the extent of more corporations become comfortable integrating Bitcoin or a facility in their way to integrate Bitcoin to their product or service or they\u2019re facilitated in integrating Bitcoin with their balance sheet, we think that it will be beneficial to Bitcoin, all Bitcoin holders and our shareholders included.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you. So moving to Phong now. Are there any bond covenants that could force MicroStrategy to liquidate Bitcoin holdings?\nPhong Le: No. We don\u2019t have any covenants that will require us to liquidate any Bitcoin holdings. The covenants we have on our convertible notes and \u2013 are secured on or primarily incurrence covenants, which means they may limit our ability to kind of additional debt but nothing that would stop us in our tracks and say we have to do something prior to the bonds maturing. So really, the first maturity \u2013 as you saw, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is December 2025 would be the first time we\u2019d have to adjust any of our bonds.\nShirish Jajodia: Okay. And one more question for Phong -- actually, we'll move to Mike now. And one question is whether do we plan to expand into Bitcoin products to grow our revenue?\nMichael Saylor: Right now, our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin. So we don\u2019t have any plans to offer additional products. Our product focus is business intelligence. Our treasury and our balance sheet focus is acquiring and hold Bitcoin. It\u2019s always theoretically possible that we will find new and interesting opportunities, but if we were to find those things, we would vet them, consider them carefully, evaluate whether they\u2019re likely to be accretive or dilutive and whether they\u2019re a distraction or whether they\u2019re really strategic. And if we deem it to be something material, we would disclose at that time.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. I think -- thank you, Michael and Phong. This brings us to the end of our question-and-answer sessions. Thank you, everyone, for your questions. And now I will turn the call over to Michael again for the closing remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thanks, Shirish. I want to thank all of our shareholders. Thanks for spending the time with us today. Thanks for your support. We couldn't do it without you. And I wish you a good quarter, and we'll see you again in 12 weeks.\nPhong Le: Thanks, everyone.",

            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2021 fourth quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who's going to provide an update on our operations and the financials for the quarter. Thank you, Phong. I will just comment on our business strategy. We have 2, our business intelligence strategy and our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. With regard to business intelligence, our path forward is to continue to improve the product to rotate our revenues from enterprise-software-based to cloud-based. And to general -- to continue to grow our installed base, we had 6% top line growth last year. That was awesome. I expect we'll continue to grow the business either by taking advantage of special marketing opportunities that our brand brings us for sales activity.

So that's a mature but balanced, well-understood enterprise software business, and it's generating excellent free cash flows for us, cash flows in excess of what we need to reinvest in order to grow the business. So that leads us to our second strategy, which is Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We're going to continue to reinvest our free cash flows from the core business into Bitcoin. This morning, we announced we'd acquired $25 million worth of additional Bitcoin from free cash flow. I think that's a powerful strategy for us, and it's working well. Obviously, we'll hold the existing Bitcoin. We've crossed 125,000 Bitcoin now. And as Phong had pointed out, much of that Bitcoin is not pledged as collateral.

If there ever is a Bitcoin spot market ETF, it would be 50 to 100 basis points cost annually for investors. MicroStrategy is in a fortunate situation because we are an operating company that generates free cash flow.

But if you're looking for an operating company that's going to acquire more Bitcoin that isn't subject to the competitive and uncertain dynamics of the mining business, then MicroStrategy is a fairly unique player in the space.

And it's worked together well. I think it's elevated our brand. It's opened up new sales opportunities for us, new marketing opportunities for us. And of course, being able to channel our proceeds from our software business into the Bitcoin strategy, I think, is a great opportunity and we'll pursue that. With regard to the outlook to Bitcoin, I think that in the last 12 months, the asset classes has evolved and matured. I see evidence of a lot more institutional adoption, greater adoption amongst macro and other hedge funds. We've made great progress with corporations. There will be 24 publicly traded Bitcoin miners by the end of the quarter, so lots of publicly traded companies in the Bitcoin space, more and more publicly traded companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, more and more public investors with Bitcoin exposure, more banks rolling out Bitcoin acquisition and trading and custody services, more regulatory awareness and more clarity as to how the entire crypto industry is going to evolve.

And there's a growing sentiment that we see across the mainstream that Bitcoin is here to stay. The crypto economy represents a great opportunity for the entire world. And politicians and investors and corporations are working diligently to come to terms on what this means and how they should adjust their practices. I see all these things as very positive steps forward versus where we were a year ago. I'm really hard-pressed to think of any material developments in the past 12 months that are putting us at a disadvantaged situation versus a year ago. I think generally, we've had a passage of positive developments. And we look forward to the next wave of institutional adoption that, I think, should be driven as people get more educated and more aware of what digital property is. And as all of the various vendors in the space, all enhance their product offerings and their service offerings in order to make adoption of digital assets and Bitcoin in specific easier. So with that, I think we're ready to go on to questions and answers, if we have questions from the analysts and investment community, Shirish? You're on mute. I think that as enthusiasm to trade and hold and bank digital assets and Bitcoin in particular grows, there are going to be \u2013 there's going to be an increase in the number of creditworthy counterparties that we could do business with and increasing the options that we have. So we have a large amount of assets. So in theory, we could lend them out for yield. 2 years ago, there weren't that many counterparties and there were no, say, FDIC-insured banks that might want to borrow and give us yield. But I think that as FDIC-insured banks get into the space, and it seems like it's just a matter of time before they do get into the space and as very large $1 trillion balance sheet entities get in the space, we'll have a much deeper selection of counterparties that we might work with to either borrow from or generate yield from either of those or \u2013 and/or maybe generate some yield on our own through selling volatility. I think all of these options that we have, they all come with a risk \u2013 a counterparty risk and they come with a theoretical opportunity cost. And then they also come with an execution cost and a whole set of compliance and other sorts of disclosure issues and strategy issues that we consider. So we'll parse the opportunities carefully as they evolve. But certainly, in a world where, say, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, Bank of America and Citigroup and JPMorgan are interested and involved in the space, then I think the options that will be available to us over time will be greater. And the counterparty risk that we would have to incur will be less \u2013 and I think that \u2013 that's part of the maturing of the market, which will be good for everybody in it. I think the most important number to focus on is the amount of Bitcoin that we have that is not pledged as collateral, which I think Phong pointed out. What was it, Phong, 110,000 or so? So 110,000 Bitcoin would be the asset that is not pledged as collateral that we could potentially consider using either to generate yield or to leverage. Yes. So regarding the first question, we wouldn't choose to issue stock if we didn't think it was accretive. And whether it's accretive or not depends on a variety of circumstances and \u2013 facts and circumstances. But we're certainly not going to issue stock if we don't believe it's accretive. Regarding to the second question, we have free cash flow in excess of the debt service and the interest on the debt, and we're comfortable that we can cover the interest on our debt from our free cash flows. Well, this is our second annual Bitcoin for corporations conference. We kicked it off last year. To my knowledge, this has like been the primary, if not one of the fewer or the only Bitcoin-related conference, focused upon corporate adoption of Bitcoin as opposed to institutional investors or retail investors or technology or some other audience. We expect to continue to do the conference annually. We found that annual is good cadence. Our goal is to educate corporations on the benefits of Bitcoin and then the mechanics and the other nuances of integrating Bitcoin into their products or their services or their balance sheet. And there are going to be new developments every year. So I think that we'll want to do a refresher each year, and we try to curate a set of institutional-grade vendors that can help with things like commercial banking a Bitcoin or investment banking Bitcoin companies or payments on Bitcoin rails or exchange trading Bitcoin or custody of Bitcoin. So we feel like it's been good for our brand. It's helped in our \u2013 it's improved our marketing reach. We don't see it as a revenue generator per se. We don't have any intentions to monetize the event now or in the future. We're primarily providing this as an educational service to the general public because we believe it's in the best interest of the industry. To the extent of more corporations become comfortable integrating Bitcoin or a facility in their way to integrate Bitcoin to their product or service or they're facilitated in integrating Bitcoin with their balance sheet, we think that it will be beneficial to Bitcoin, all Bitcoin holders and our shareholders included. Right now, our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin. So we don't have any plans to offer additional products. Our product focus is business intelligence. Our treasury and our balance sheet focus is acquiring and hold Bitcoin. It's always theoretically possible that we will find new and interesting opportunities, but if we were to find those things, we would vet them, consider them carefully, evaluate whether they're likely to be accretive or dilutive and whether they're a distraction or whether they're really strategic. And if we deem it to be something material, we would disclose at that time. Thanks, Shirish. I want to thank all of our shareholders. Thanks for spending the time with us today. Thanks for your support. We couldn't do it without you. And I wish you a good quarter, and we'll see you again in 12 weeks."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. I'd like to start off with an update on our successful day 1 of our MicroStrategy World 2022 event today. We had 2 parallel tracks. The first was the enterprise analytics track featuring discussions with industry leaders, including Nice, Sainsbury's and the Schwarz Group about why the MicroStrategy platform is their tool of choice for the enterprise for cloud-powered analytics and for OEMs. And the second track was Bitcoin for Corporations, featuring Jack Dorsey, CEO, Chairman and Co-Founder of Block as the keynote speaker. This is our second annual Bitcoin for Corporations event, where we present our playbook to other corporates who are looking to explore how Bitcoin can provide an innovative treasury and product strategy. We had an amazing turnout with over 28,000 attendees viewing the event live worldwide. Replays for today's session will be available on our website. As a reminder, MicroStrategy World 2022 is 100% virtual and free of cost. So please feel free to register and tune in to the second and final day of the event tomorrow. Now turning to our results. The fourth quarter was a good finish to what was an exciting and transformational year for MicroStrategy. Before I review our fourth quarter results in detail, I want to underscore the key highlights from 2021 for the company. First, we had a solid sales year, returning to positive year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since 2014. Total revenue for 2021 was $510.8 million, up 6.2% versus 2020. Product license revenues for the year was up 17%, growing for the first time since 2013. And subscription revenue was up 30% versus the full year 2020. The focus on term license sales contributed to the material growth in license revenue and subscription revenue. We also made important progress in our shift towards our cloud offering, which drove annual subscription billings up 39% year-over-year to $55.4 million as of year-end 2021, which is the highest level in our history. Second, on our balance sheet. Our pioneering decision to make Bitcoin our primary treasury reserve asset has made MicroStrategy a thought leader in the cryptocurrency market and generated great interest in MicroStrategy as a corporation. In 2021, we added a total of 53,922 Bitcoins to our balance sheet at an average price of $48,710 per bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. We believe that our brand value has benefited significantly because of our investment in Bitcoin. We believe that such market attention, when captured correctly, has helped to create software pipeline growth and sales growth. Thus, we believe our 2 corporate strategies are synergistic to each other, creating a virtuous flywheel. Our performance in 2021 is indicative of the multiple ways MicroStrategy is able to create meaningful value for our shareholders. Moreover, our strategy has also benefited our employees and increased general pride in our organization. As a result, we have seen improvement in our employee retention rates and ability to attract and retain top talent. Turning to our fourth quarter results. We're pleased with our performance in this quarter across both of our corporate strategies. For the sixth straight quarter, we posted strong financial and operational results for our software business and made incremental investments in Bitcoin. Our Enterprise Analytics business delivered another strong quarter, and we've seen increased adoption of the MicroStrategy platform, especially in the cloud by new and existing customers. We had another active quarter with our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, executing another successful capital raise through our at-the-market offering under our open market sale agreement and expanding our digital asset holdings. Total revenue in the quarter grew 2.4% year-over-year or 4.4% on a constant currency basis to $134.5 million. Product license revenues was up 9% year-over-year or 13% on a constant currency basis. Subscription revenue was up 35% year-over-year, also 35% on a constant currency basis. And current subscription billings grew 53% year-over-year, our seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth to $24.3 million. Before turning to our financial results in greater detail, I'd like to reiterate some of the key takeaways from the Investor Day we held in December. We are as excited as we have ever been about the opportunities that lie ahead for MicroStrategy. We are targeting a multibillion-dollar market opportunity that is at an early stage of moving off of legacy technology and to the cloud. We're well positioned to meet the demands of enterprise customers with our modern analytics platform, and we're targeting 3 key areas of growth. First, enterprise analytics. Our platform is expressly designed to address the needs of large corporations looking for analytics to unlock the power of their data and create value for their internal users and external stakeholders. We're replacing and consolidating legacy and departmental analytics use cases because of our full-scale enterprise capabilities. A great example of enterprise analytics in action is at the Schwarz Group, the fourth largest retailer in the world with worldwide brands, including Lidl and Kaufland. As they discussed at our MicroStrategy World event today, they have tens of thousands of users leveraging MicroStrategy reports on web and mobile in more than 30 countries. They've also adapted dossier for self-service BI, and hundreds of reports have been created by their power users to serve data analytics needs across their business all based on that same single version of the truth they've established with MicroStrategy. These solutions are used by team members in individual stores all the way up to their international Board of Directors. Second, OEM. We're number one in the market in our embedded OEM business. MicroStrategy is well positioned to further benefit from the trend in the embedded analytics and OEM marketplace where enterprises are now buying and not building analytics. We offer streamlined and differentiated developer-focused solutions for OEMs and technology companies. We believe our extensive investment in an open architecture driven by open APIs and SDKs provides OEMs with the best solution in the market. And we believe by targeting this market, we can grow our market share. Nice is the world's leading provider of cloud-native customer experience management and optimization software and a major OEM customer. They embed MicroStrategy into their entire solution suite because they like the scalability and sophistication it provides and they recognize we're a reliable partner. As I shared at World today, such adoption allowed them to get to market faster and to operate at the global scale they need, serving 125,000 organizations over 150 countries. They also discussed why they chose MicroStrategy in a competitive field. We align with their native cloud architecture, their data model, their modern user experience, and we share the same approach to our technology as they do in terms of velocity, openness and innovation. Beyond the technical benefits, they also value our partnership, and they've heard from their customers that the data and analytics visualization achieved within  using MicroStrategy is out of this world. The third focus area is cloud. We offer an innovative enterprise analytics solution in the cloud, combining app-parity capabilities with our leading on-premise solution with strong security and cloud practices, reducing operational complexity and cost for our customers. We expect to grow by migrating on-premise customers, expanding existing cloud customers and defaulting new customers to the cloud. Sainsbury's, one of the largest retail chains in the U.K., replaced various legacy analytics tools with MicroStrategy Cloud as the enterprise standard. Today, they have a suite of over 30 applications, delivering data-driven insights to 12,000-plus users across their organization. In every 1 of their over 1,400 stores, their colleagues leveraged several applications on mobile devices for various functions so that they can maximize the time they spend on the store serving floor customers -- on the store floor serving customers. And that spans across all aspects of their organization right up to the C-suite. This is all built on 3 complementary cloud technologies, AWS, Snowflake and MicroStrategy as the analytics delivery mechanism for their entire business. MicroStrategy Cloud has continued to perform -- to become a growing mix of our business, while our on-prem product has continued to perform well. We had great subscription billings momentum in Q4 2021, and we seek to accelerate this momentum in 2022. We're committed to meeting the needs of our customers regardless of how they would like to deploy MicroStrategy, some of whom operate in highly regulated industries or countries where cloud deployment is not feasible. When you look at the overall growth of our subscription and license business, it is clear that underlying demand for our platform has demonstrated signs of strength. We believe that our pace of innovation is as impressive now as it has been in many years, with the company now producing quarterly and monthly software updates. Our team has rolled out a robust set of product features and enhancements that we believe will expand the value we provide customers and represent future incremental growth opportunities. We recently released our most secure, performant and innovative platform version ever, purpose-built to meet the most challenging and sophisticated needs of our user base. We've delivered low-code/no-code technologies that permit users to fully implement -- to implement fully functional analytics applications with a fantastic UI/UX, lowering the learning curve to deploy compelling interactive analytics solutions across the enterprise. We've also continued to invest in HyperIntelligence, our zero-click analytics product designed to deliver in-context insights to anyone, anywhere. Finally, this year, we rolled out a fully modernized reference architecture based on containers and microservices. This architecture is built to deliver scalable, multi-tenant SaaS solutions across tens of thousands of users and provide developers with a streamlined experience to leverage continuous integration and continuous deployment. Overall, I'm very pleased with the pace of product innovation and the way our analytics business is performing. We have shown consistent growth, and we're confident in our ability to achieve long-term growth targets while maintaining profitability. Turning now to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We had another active and successful quarter. We raised approximately $596 million in capital through the sale of Class A common shares as part of our at-the-market offering during the quarter. We used the net proceeds from this offering to purchase an additional 10,349 Bitcoins at an average price of $57,113 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. This is the fourth successful capital raise we have done in the past year, having raised $2.6 billion of new debt and equity capital that we have deployed in support of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. As of December 31, 2021, we've reached the maximum program amount of $1 billion under our existing ATM facility, which we used in Q3 and Q4 to issue around 1.4 million shares at a weighted average stock price of approximately $707 to purchase a total of 18,863 Bitcoin. As of December 31, 2021, MicroStrategy own 124,391 Bitcoins that we acquired for a total of $3.75 billion or $30,159 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. The market value of our Bitcoin holdings was $5.7 billion at December 31, 2021, reflecting approximately $2 billion of unrealized gains or approximately 50% appreciation when compared to the original cost basis of our Bitcoin at December 31, 2021. The book value of our Bitcoin holdings was roughly $2.9 billion. This morning, we announced that we acquired an additional 660 Bitcoins for $25 million using our excess cash at an average price of approximately $37,865 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. As of yesterday, January 31, 2022, we hold approximately 125,051 Bitcoins. They required an aggregate purchase price of $3.78 billion at an average purchase price of $30,200 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. As of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time yesterday, the market price of 1 Bitcoin in our principal market was $38,450, which equates to a market value roughly $4.8 billion. MicroStrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of an enterprise's treasury policies, generating incremental value to our shareholders and, in doing so, established itself as the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. Currently, our MacroStrategy subsidiary holds over 110,000 Bitcoins that are not pledged as collateral under our senior secured notes. We may consider additional opportunities that utilize this strategic asset to acquire more capital to deploy towards our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. This may include vehicles such as Bitcoin-backed bonds or loaning out our Bitcoin to seek to generate yield. We have not targeted any specific course of action at this point and may ultimately decide not to pursue any of these paths. Turning to our fourth quarter 2021 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $134.5 million, up 2% -- 2.4% year-over-year or 4.4% on a constant currency basis. Product license revenues were $32.5 million in the fourth quarter 2021, up 9% year-over-year or 13% on a constant currency basis. Subscription services revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $11.8 million, an increase of 35% year-over-year, also 35% on a constant currency basis. The growth in subscription services revenues reflects the increased portion of our product bookings that were related to our managed cloud platform. The current subscription billings in the fourth quarter of 2021 were $24.3 million, an increase of 53% year-over-year. We are pleased with the performance of our cloud business in the fourth quarter, and we'll look for growth to continue to accelerate. Product support revenues were $69.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of 4% year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by certain existing customers converting from perpetual product licenses to our subscription services or term license offerings. As we see more on-premise conversions to our cloud offering, we would anticipate product support revenue will experience a modest decline over time. Finally, our other services revenue, which largely reflects our consulting services, were $21.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, staying largely flat with a modest increase of 0.5% year-over-year or 2% on a constant currency basis. We believe that stability of consulting revenues is an indication of continued engagement from our customers to modernize and retain deployment of their MicroStrategy platform. Now I'll elaborate on our recent responses on the SEC comment letter dated December 16, 2021. As required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the SEC undertakes some level of review of each reporting company at least once every 3 years and reviews a significant number of companies more frequently. The SEC staff frequently provides comments where the staff believes the company can enhance its disclosures. As part of our recent review by the SEC, MicroStrategy engaged in a routine exchange of comment and response letters with the SEC -- with the SEC staff. In that exchange, we discussed with them whether to include adjustments related to Bitcoin impairment losses in our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures. We agreed with them that on a going-forward basis, any non-GAAP financial measures we may present in future filings should retain the impact from Bitcoin impairment losses. This change in the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures does not impact our strategy, operations or GAAP financial statements or previous SEC filings. As something of a pioneer in the Bitcoin space, we have faced some uncertainty regarding the disclosure requirements and non-GAAP presentation as they relate to Bitcoin. And I appreciate the clarity that engaging in that comment process with the SEC staff has provided us. As a reminder, our Bitcoin holdings are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in their fair value below our book value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we incurred digital asset impairment charges of $147 million. Shifting to our cost, total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude share-based compensation expenses, were $259 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP cost of revenues was $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $2.4 million or 12% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 1.4%, driven by increases in cloud customer hosting fees and personnel costs from additional head count. As we continue to accelerate our shift to cloud, we expect increases in infrastructure costs and head count to support additional customers. Over time, our cloud business -- over time, we expect our cloud business to scale, decreasing costs as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $40 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in sales compensation from improved bookings performance. However, as a percentage of product license and subscription revenue, this reflects a decrease of 10%, indicating improved productivity of our sales and marketing teams. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $28 million, an increase of $3.6 million or 15% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 2.3%, driven by head count increases, cost of hiring and wage inflation. The technology sector has experienced significant wage inflation and competition for resources, and we anticipate that trend will continue in 2022 and that we will continue to invest in additional R&D head count and work to retain our talented engineers and continue to provide a best-in-class product. Non-GAAP G&A expense was $22 million, an increase of $3.8 million or 21% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 2.5%, driven primarily by an increase of Bitcoin-related fees, including custody, legal, audit and other consulting fees related to executing our Bitcoin strategy. Overall, we feel comfortable with our cost structure and our ability to generate cash flow sustainably. Total non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $124.3 million, inclusive of an impairment charge related to Bitcoin of $146.6 million. As discussed, going forward, we will no longer adjust for the impairment charges related to Bitcoin in our non-GAAP metrics. We will continue to report the Bitcoin impairment charges separately. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $63 million in cash. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of December 31, 2021, was $2.9 billion, which reflects $901 million in cumulative impairment charges that have also been reflected as losses on our GAAP income statements in the periods occurred. Our noncash Bitcoin impairment charges will remain subject to market volatility of Bitcoin prices. Given the significant drop in the market price of Bitcoin in January 2022, we will recognize significant impairment charges again in the first quarter of 2022. As one of the leading advocates for digital assets, we've been working with peer companies and various policy-setting agencies in the U.S. to try to determine a more appropriate accounting framework for digital assets. In Q3 2021, we wrote to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, that the disconnect between an entity's financial statements and the economic reality of its financial condition and results of operations fails to provide investors, analysts and the general public with the information they need to make an informed assessment of an entity's current and future prospects. Currently, companies that aren't investment companies report Bitcoin as intangible assets. This means Bitcoin gets initially recorded on balance sheets at its historic cost and then is deemed impaired at the market value every dip. However, the carry value can never conversely be revised upward if the price of Bitcoin increases. In Q4, the FASB announced that they have added a project to their research agenda to explore accounting for exchange-traded digital assets. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, we believe we have a responsibility to share what we've learned since embarking on this strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this new asset class. Next, I would like to emphasize the strength of our robust capital structure. From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we are insulated from the near-term volatility of Bitcoin prices since we currently do not have any debt principal maturities coming due until December 2025. Our 0.75% senior convertible notes due 2025 are convertible into our Class A shares at an initial conversion price of $398 per share and mature in December 2025. Our 0% senior convertible notes are convertible into our Class A shares at an initial conversion price of $1,432 per share and mature in February 2027. Our 6.125% senior secured notes currently mature in June 2028, subject to a springing maturity feature. Regarding the interest payments on these instruments, we have comfortable levels of excess cash flows generated through our software business to cover the interest as it becomes accrued and are payable. Additionally, we maintain a certain minimum amount of cash balance to fund our regular working capital needs. Moving to our cash flow trajectory. If we consider non-GAAP free cash flow, which is defined as our GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures related to investing activities, our annual non-GAAP free cash flow has grown over the last 3 years to $91 million in 2021. Correspondingly, our non-GAAP free cash flow margin has also improved over the last 3 years, reaching approximately 18% in 2021. We benefited from improving revenues from ongoing product innovations, improved sales and marketing execution as well as an improved cost structure, benefiting from our early embrace of the virtual wave. Our 2022 outlook remains positive with our continued transition to cloud and our expectation of a sustained increase in subscription billings. Our cloud transition will result in increased cloud billings and subscription billings. With the growth of our subscription billings in Q4 2021, it's possible that our product license revenue and total revenue growth in 2021 will decelerate even as our overall software business expands. This will depend largely on the mix of new sales between cloud and on-premise licenses. This is because of a new cloud contract, which may have a higher total contract value than an on-premise license, still results in lower recognized revenue in the first year. The lower revenue may also cause a short-term decline in profitability due to the revenue J curve, which will more than normalize in the long term. Overall, we feel we're well positioned to achieve our long-term growth sales target of greater than 10% and increased free cash flow targets over time. Finally, in my role as President of MicroStrategy, I've held the Head of Worldwide Sales role for the past 1.5 years and the CFO role for nearly all of the past 6 years. To support our growth and allow me time to focus more on corporate strategy and day-to-day operations, we announced that we're looking to hire a full-time CFO. We're still in the process of that search. In addition, we've also been looking for a dedicated leader of worldwide sales and have found that person. We're excited to announce the recent internal promotion of Kevin Adkisson to our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer position. Kevin joined MicroStrategy in October 2016 as a sales leader in our central business and has been promoted several times since then due to his outstanding sales results as well as his ability to hire, develop and inspire a high-performing team. Kevin is known for his track record of success and is instrumental in our transition to the cloud. I look forward to having more time to focus on my role as President, running the day-to-day business of MicroStrategy as well as strategically planning for our long-term health and growth. I'll now turn over the call to Michael for comments on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy as well as market trends for business intelligence software. The short answer is no. I think we're seeing an acceleration of our software business. We saw it throughout the course of 2021, benefiting from our most recent product cycle, increased demand in the general market, and also, I think some \u2013 the flywheel effect I talked about from our Bitcoin strategy. So no, we're not seeing an acceleration of billings from 2022 to 2021. I think we are seeing general growth. Yes, I'd say there are 3 areas where we saw some margin dilution in the fourth quarter. The first is in our cloud business, we are starting to ramp up the team in anticipation, as you saw with our cloud billings of significant growth. So as that cloud business starts to scale, that margin dilution, I think, will reduce. And so that's area #1. Area #2 is related to R&D. We'll continue to invest in our technology team, more folks around the world. And as probably as well-known at this point in time, there is a lot of wage inflation and a very competitive marketplace for technology resources. And so to make sure we have the right team in place and we retain folks, we will see some wage increases there. I expect that portion in terms of margin dilution will continue for the near future. And then the third area that we saw some margin dilution is in our G&A costs as it relates to our Bitcoin strategy. So fees, custody fees, some onetime costs related to consulting fees, advisory fees, legal fees, that should reduce its dilution over time, too. So those are the 3 areas. And I do recognize the cost structure went up a little bit in Q4, but I think long term, we still expect our margins to be accretive as a business as we grow. Yes, 110,000, exactly. Well, thank you. No, I don't think you're going to \u2013 we would expect a lot of major changes. Kevin has been with the company 5 years now. He was instrumental to some of the changes that we made in 2020. As we embraced the virtual wave and went more to digital marketing, obviously, less in-person events, less in-person \u2013 fewer in-person meetings and also really moving to the cloud. So I think it's an acceleration of those elements and better and better sales adoption and customer adoption of those strategies. But I don't think we have any major fundamental changes planned in the short term. It's a couple of things. First of all, if you see our product license revenue growth last year, 17% constant currency, subscription billings growth last year, 35% roughly, you combine those 2, those are really the foundational elements of growing the overall business. Product license revenue growth drives support revenue. Subscription revenue growth drives more cloud and more high-quality recurring revenue. So I think if you see those levels of growth, that should lead to greater than 10% revenue growth over time. We have a shift of decrease in support revenue, and it's a large amount, but the other pieces should outweigh that. And then our consulting business continues to chug along, and it should grow sort of at the level that you see the product piece is growing. I put all of that together. I think 10% is very achievable. There \u2013 it could be slightly depressed this year as we really rapidly accelerate to cloud. But I don't see that to be a long-term drag on our revenue growth potential. Yes. So we saw for the full year of 2021, 35% growth in our cloud billings. In the fourth quarter, we saw it at 53%. And I think as we get into 2022, that number could further accelerate. And today at least, that is on the back of some medium-sized and sort of a few large customers. I do think we will start to see that trend more and more towards large customers in 2022. I think there is a comfort for large customers to move to the cloud more so in the next year or so, and then it's just a process, right? It takes longer for a large customer to go through the cloud migration process. But I would say as we enter 2022, we're sort of right in the meat of really starting to accelerate that cloud migration journey, which is exciting. We've done a lot of work on our product and on our processes and our operations to be prepared for that. No. We don't have any covenants that will require us to liquidate any Bitcoin holdings. The covenants we have on our convertible notes and \u2013 are secured on or primarily incurrence covenants, which means they may limit our ability to kind of additional debt but nothing that would stop us in our tracks and say we have to do something prior to the bonds maturing. So really, the first maturity \u2013 as you saw, we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is December 2025 would be the first time we'd have to adjust any of our bonds. Thanks, everyone."

I'll be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2021 third quarter earnings webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the safe harbor statement. Some of the information we provide in this presentation regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also in this presentation we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing the GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and the appendix of this presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at www.microstrategy.com. We would like to welcome you all to today's webinar and let you know that we will be taking questions using the Q&A feature at the bottom of your screen. You can submit questions throughout the webinar, and Michael or Phong will answer your questions at the end of the session. Please be sure to provide you name and your company's name when submitting your questions. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael Saylor, Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Jeremy. I'm Michael Saylor, the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our third quarter 2021 financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who's going to provide an update on our operations and our financials for the quarter.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Michael. We're pleased with the performance in the third quarter across both of our strategic priorities. For the fifth straight quarter we posted strong financial and operational results with our software business and made investments in Bitcoin. Our enterprise analytics business delivered another strong quarter, and we are seeing growing adoption of the MicroStrategy platform, especially in the cloud by new and existing customers. We also had another active and successful quarter with our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, executing on our fourth successful capital raise in the past year and expanding our digital asset holdings. Our results in the third quarter are indicative of the multiple ways microstrategy is able to create meaningful and unique value for our shareholders. Total revenue in the quarter grew slightly year-over-year to $128 million. This is a strong performance against an incredibly difficult comp in the third quarter of 2020. As you might recall, in Q3 2020 we signed several deals that were delayed from the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 and signed a large expansion transaction with a major financial institution. Comparing against 2019, which adjusts for these impacts, total revenue grew 7% versus the third quarter of 2019. We think this is a good proxy for the underlying growth of the business. License revenue was down 13% year-over-year, but up 36% versus the third quarter of 2019. Subscription revenue in the quarter was up 31% compared to Q3 of 2020. Current subscription billings grew 23%, our sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Finally, we had another strong quarter of profitability with a non-GAAP operating income of $27.7 million and margin of 22%. MicroStrategy Cloud continues to become a growing mix of our business, while our on-prem product continues to perform well. We're committed to meeting the needs of our customers, regardless of how they would like to deploy MicroStrategy, some of whom operate in highly regulated industries or countries where a cloud deployment is not feasible. When you look at the overall growth of our subscription and license businesses, it is clear that underlying demand for our platform has demonstrated signs of strength. I'd like to highlight the three emerging trends in the data and analytics industry, acting as tailwinds for MicroStrategy. These trends are converging to create enterprise analytics super cycle, which is likely to widen the gap between organizations that are able to maximize their investments in data analytics and those that cannot. First, the demand for enterprise analytics has grown and has been accelerated due to the structural changes as a result of the pandemic. Enterprises are striving to stay ahead of changes in market trends, customer demand, supply chains and employee availability. The capacity to rapidly develop and deploy business and productivity applications to users at any location is now essential. To get there, the data-driven organizations are rushing to modernize their analytics as well as need data and business apps to the cloud. This market shift is putting pressure on legacy mega vendors who are prioritizing moving their ERP and infrastructure customers to cloud versus investing in their own BI applications. As enterprises now evaluate options to modernize their analytics and BI solutions, MicroStrategy has emerged as a logical vendor of choice because of its full-scale enterprise capabilities. A conclusion is substantiated by an accelerated replacement of legacy and  vendor BI platforms. Examples this quarter, our license deal, we won the largest hotel brands worldwide to replace Cognos for their entire property fleet as well as a big consulting deal with a leading media and entertainment company to migrate their legacy reports from business objects to MicroStrategy. The second trend is that proven solutions are replacing experimental initiatives. And enterprises are turning to trusted partners that deliver concrete results. According to a growing number of industry analysts, there is a notable reduction in organization's willingness to experiment with niche technologies in the times of macroeconomic uncertainty. In the short term, it leads to focus on customers. During this year, enterprises have prioritized the use of a unified platform that can deliver a broad set of use cases and are typically seeing significant cost savings through vendor consolidation. An example is a major win in a large insurance company to replace their suite of point experimental unproven VI solutions. The third trend is that the enterprises are now buying and not building analytics. To meet this demand, a growing number of OEMs as are supporting enterprises by developing solutions which require partnering with an open enterprise scale technology vendor. MicroStrategy is well positioned to benefit from this growing trend in the embedded analytics and OEM marketplace. We are #1 in the market in our embedded OEM business. We have seen an increased interest from new and existing customers that want to leverage our innovative business analytics platform as a core part of their technology solution. We believe our extensive investment in an open architecture driven by open APIs and SDKs provides OEMs with the best solution in the market. We experienced notable growth in both the number and size of OEM opportunities, including a deal with a multinational consumer credit reporting company and a deal with a video analytics company. Continuing with market sentiment. I'm also pleased to share that MicroStrategy was recognized with the Customers' Choice distinction in Gartner's latest Voice to the Customer report, which summarizes customer feedback on their BI platforms. We're now more than a year into our virtual wave strategy, and we have seen this approach can drive faster growth and greater productivity on a sustained basis. We're particularly pleased with our profitability performance with non-GAAP operating margin above 20%. This is the eighth straight quarter with an improvement in our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin. To provide some context around our increase in sales productivity, our sales and marketing and G&A expenses on a trailing 12-month basis are down $34 million or 12% from fiscal year 2019 levels, while our product license revenue has grown 36% since Q3 2019, and subscription services revenue has grown 37% over that time. This translates to an increase in our sales productivity of 31% in the last year and 72% in the last three years. As a result, we repurposed some of those savings into R&D investments in areas like cloud, security, OEM, and new innovations to enhance our value proposition and lay the foundation for long-term durable growth. This is a virtuous cycle that we believe we can continue delivering on going forward. It's important to note that our pace of innovation is as impressive as it has been in many years with the company now produced quarterly and monthly software updates. Our team is working on a robust set of product features and enhancements that we believe will expand the value we provide customers and represent future incremental growth opportunities. To summarize our priorities, our focus going forward remains on moving to Cloud, expanding our OEM market share, modernizing our customer base and using our innovative offerings like HyperIntelligence to expand new prospects. Overall, I'm very pleased with the way our analytics business is performing. We are on the path of consistent growth, and we're confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth and profitability targets. Turning now to our Bitcoin strategy. We had another active and successful quarter. We raised approximately $400 million in capital through the sale of Class A common shares as part of our aftermarket offering during the quarter. We used the proceeds of this offering and excess cash to purchase an additional approximately 8,957 Bitcoins at an average price of $46,876 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. This is the fourth successful capital raise we've done in the past year, having raised $2.6 billion in new debt and equity capital that we deployed in support of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We have approximately $600 million remaining in our existing ATM facility, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in executing against it. Today, MicroStrategy owns approximately 114,042 Bitcoins that we acquired for a total cost of $3.2 billion or $27,713 per Bitcoin. The market value for our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $5 billion at September 30, 2021, reflecting $1.8 billion of unrealized gains or approximately 57% depreciation when compared to the cost basis of our Bitcoin at September 30, 2021. The book value of our BITCOIN holdings is $2.4 billion. As of yesterday, October 27, 2021, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the market price at one bit coin in our principal market was approximately $59,111, which equates to a market value of roughly $6.7 billion of Bitcoin, representing more than 110% depreciation. MicroStrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of enterprise's treasury policies, created billions of dollars of incremental value for our shareholders. And in doing so, established itself as one of the world's largest owners of Bitcoin. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to raise additional capital to execute on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has the potential to offer asymmetric upside to our shareholders. Before I turn to a more detailed review of this quarter's financial results, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the execution of both of our strategic priorities. As a result of our strong financial performance, year-to-date, the company is reaffirming our 2021 estimate of non-GAAP operating income of $80 million to $100 million. We also expect further acceleration of our cloud billings in Q4 2021 and going into 2022. We are excited to provide an update on our strategy later this quarter when we hold our 2021 Investor Day on December 2, 2021. We're looking forward to providing a deep dive, the future path of our enterprise analytics business and digital asset holdings and how it will benefit shareholders over time. Turning to our third quarter 2021 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $128 million, up slightly year-over-year and up 7% from the third quarter of 2019. Product license revenues were $25.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, down 13% year-over-year and up 36% from the third quarter of 2019. As mentioned earlier in the call, comparison with third quarter of 2019 is a good proxy for the underlying growth of the business due to the effects of COVID-19 and a large expansion transaction we signed with a major financial institution in the third quarter of 2020. Subscription services revenue in the third quarter of 2019 were $10.9 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year. The growth in subscription services revenue reflects a growing portion of our product bookings that are related to our cloud -- managed-cloud platform. Our current subscription billings in the third quarter of 2021 were $8 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the performance of our cloud business in the third quarter, and we'll look for growth to continue to accelerate. Product support revenues were $70.4 million in the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by certain existing customers converting from perpetual product licenses to our subscription services or term license offerings. As we see more on-premise conversions to our cloud offering, we would anticipate product support revenue will experience a modest decline over time. Finally, other services revenue, which largely reflects our consulting services for $20.9 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Improvements in consulting revenues is an indication of continued engagement from our customers to modernize and expand deployment of their MicroStrategy platform. Total GAAP expenses were $177.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, which includes the digital asset impairment charge of $65.2 million. Our Bitcoin holdings are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in our fair value below our book value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges. Total non-GAAP expenses were $100.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, a 1% decrease year-over-year. Total GAAP operating loss was $49.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, inclusive of an impairment charge related to Bitcoin of $65.2 million and stock-based compensation expense of $12.2 million. Total non-GAAP operating income was $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, a $1.1 million increase year-over-year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $57 million in cash. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of September 30, 2021, was $2.4 billion, which reflects an approximately $755 million in cumulative impairment charges that has also been reflected as a loss on our GAAP income statement in the period incurred. We exclude the quarterly impact of Bitcoin impairment charges from our non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share calculation. Bitcoin prices experienced relatively less dollar volatility in this quarter compared to the purchase prices, resulting in lower GAAP noncash impairment charge of approximately $65 million versus $425 million last quarter. As one of the leading advocates for digital assets, we've been working with peer companies and various policy setting agencies in the U.S. to try to determine a more appropriate accounting framework for digital assets. We recently wrote to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, that the disconnect between an entity's financial statements and the economic reality of its financial condition and results of operations, sales to provide investors, analysts and the general public with the information they need to make an informed assessment of an entity's current and future prospects. Currently, companies that aren't investment companies, report Bitcoin as intangible assets. This means that coin gets initially reported on balance sheet at its historic cost and then is deemed impaired at the market value ever dips. However, the carrying value can never conversely be revised upwards if the price of Bitcoin increases. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, we believe we have a responsibility to share what we've learned since embarking on this strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this new asset class. Going forward, you should continue to expect that we may purchase additional Bitcoin when our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed current working capital requirements, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, continue to issue debt or equity securities and capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin. Finally, we continue to be actively engaged in our search for the company's next CFO. They have a strong and stable executive team in place, with an average tenure in MicroStrategy of greater than 13 years and believe adding a dedicated CFO will help us in the pursuit of both of our strategies. I look forward to having more time to focus on my role as President, running the day-to-day business of MicroStrategy, as well as strategically planning for our long-term, helping growth. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for comments on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy as well as market trends for business intelligence software and our executive team.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Phong. I'll make a few comments on MicroStrategy and its business intelligence business, our macrostrategy and our Bitcoin acquisition plans. And then on the outlook for Bitcoin in general. So why don't we start with micro strategy. As Phong has pointed out, the business is running very, very well operationally. Every quarter for the last eight quarters we've got operationally more efficient. We're profitable. We're generating a very healthy operating margin. And I'm very pleased with the stability and the maturity of that business. I mean, the three key themes that we would focus on will be the shift to modern analytics from the legacy BI vendors. And we're benefiting by having made large investments to modernize our platform, and we offer an upgrade path that has a future to large enterprises that made their BI decisions back in the 2000 to 2010 time frame. Many of them are running on architectures that have languished for the past 5 to 10 years, and they're looking for something which is fresh and vital and modern. So we do win a lot of business there. And I think that that trend will continue. It probably will be even more of an important trend in the next few years. The shift to enterprise cloud continues. As Phong had pointed out, in some cases companies can't, but we think that there'll be a steady progression of motion from on-premises installations to cloud installations. And as that happens, we're able to add value and improve the overall value proposition of MicroStrategy. And also, that just improves the operational efficiency of our company and it improves the operational efficiency of our customers. So everyone in the world is looking for more operational efficiencies. How do I get newer technology that runs more efficiently within my enterprise. And certainly the shift to enterprise Cloud is consistent with that. The third theme that we continue to see is the increased prevalence of embedded analytics. Our customers looking to OEM or analytics or embed our analytics into their applications that are facing their customers and their constituencies. And microstrategies made huge investments and a broad-based set of investments and initiatives in order to provide powerful SDKs and APIs and embedding capability. And so that's helped us as well. I think that the business will continue to be driven by those three dynamics, and we're very optimistic about where they'll take us. Shifting subjects to our macro strategy to acquire and to hold Bitcoin. Most of you have followed that journey. Following our Dutch auction, which ended in September of last year, we acquired more Bitcoin. And then following our first convert, we were able to acquire more Bitcoin. Then a second convert to acquire more Bitcoin, then a senior secured debt offering to acquire more Bitcoin. And then an at-the-market equity offering to acquire more Bitcoin. And along the way, we used operating cash flows and other free cash flows from the business to acquire more Bitcoin. There is no one answer to how we go about acquiring Bitcoin. We are committed to continue to acquire Bitcoin. We don't have a plan to sell Bitcoin. We're going to keep the Bitcoin. For those of you who follow me on Twitter, I've pointed out that you should not sell you Bitcoin. We believe that Bitcoin represents a great long-term investment for the shareholders. So we're constantly evaluating the Bitcoin market and the market for our equity and the debt markets, both the convertible debt markets and the senior debt markets and other options, just to consider whether there is an opportunity for a capital raise that makes sense. We had a $1 billion ATM, but as many of you will notice, we didn't execute the entire $1 billion in the quarter. We thought that the $400 million that we did execute was accretive to the shareholders. And the timing of it was opportunistic. We felt that it was a wise management decision to sell the equity and to buy Bitcoin at the time we did. There'll be other windows where we'll think something different. At times we thought the most accretive action was a convertible debt issuance. But back in the second quarter we decided that a senior secured note was more accretive. It's impossible for us to know exactly what the right activity is going to be going forward because the markets are continually changing. We keep our options open. And we work to make sure that we can move with alacrity if we need to, in order to seize an opportunity. Looking forward, we're open to partnerships that allow us to acquire more Bitcoin. We're open to credit lines that might allow us to acquire more Bitcoin. We're open to asset-backed financing that might allow us to acquire more Bitcoin. And we will just continually evaluate these things. With regard to Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin is a pretty hot topic right now across the political media, across the financial media, across cyber space. I think that the things that are worth focusing on are the institutional maturity of the asset class has taken place over the past three months. We came into the year with two existential risk, will the Chinese be able to control Bitcoin or will a government ban Bitcoin. And it turns out that the China exodus resulted in the United States, North American Bitcoin miners becoming leaders in the Bitcoin mining business. And so a big question about whether China could control or wanted to control Bitcoin was taken off the table. The second question is, would it be banned? As I've met with institutional investors and all interested figures. The most common question is, well, it seems to be so good in every respect, it's so perfect that surely there's a catch. I guess the government may want to regulate it or ban it. And we got beyond the -- well, what is it technically, and what does it do, and why would you want to own it? It all came down to, well, it just seems to be too good to be true, someone's going to ban it. And I think the last 12 weeks have been really instrumental in putting that fear to rest. First of all, when the Chinese cracked down on Bitcoin mining, they didn't ban the ownership of Bitcoin, and that was an interesting nuance. Second, we had senatorial hearings and congressional hearings where we saw a broad array of senators express support for Bitcoin. And we saw a broad array, a bipartisan array of congressmen and Congress people express support for Bitcoin. And so we can see Congress and Senate are very supportive. We've seen people ask point blank at Treasury, at the SEC, at the CFTC, do you have any intention to ban cryptocurrencies? And the answer is no. And specifically with regard to Bitcoin, I think it's quite clear that within treasury, within the CFTC, within the SEC and with the EU Central Bank, there's no intention to block institutions from owning this asset. It's been referred to as a scarce speculative digital asset or store of value asset. And I think the clarity that's come into the marketplace is that it's not a currency, it is an asset. It's going to be taxed as an asset, which means on sale you would pay a capital gain, short or long-term capital gain of sorts. It's not going to be treated as a medium in exchange or a currency in the western world, most of the world, with just a few exceptions. I think that that's provided clarity for institutional investors. So the commentary from the SEC, the treasury, the Senate, Congress, I think was probably one of the most important things that happened in the quarter. I think that we just saw the chair of the FDIC express interest in working through the necessary guidance to allow banks to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet. And I thought that was very auspicious. I think the fact that FASB is willing to take up this matter, at least asking for comments from the community on Bitcoin accounting is very auspicious. And the hundreds and hundreds of responses from institutional investors, from publicly traded companies from audit firms, from professional firms, from individual investors that were returned to FASB were very auspicious. And there is a general sentiment in the marketplace that this is a very important issue for regulators to take up. So we've moved beyond the will it be banned to the -- it's clearly an innovation, and it's a basis for the 21st century economy, and it's very important to financial innovation and technology leadership of the western world. I think that being the case, that removed a big hurdle for many institutional investors to own Bitcoin. I think another big hurdle has been the lack of an ETF because all of the financial advisers of which there is 220,000, I guess, in the U.S., holding or controlling $100 trillion of assets, those financial advisers couldn't buy Bitcoin with their existing prime brokerage accounts, with their existing accounting systems or be compensated for that Bitcoin. That's a big deal. That's the difference between being able to take 60 seconds and buy $20 million and have it part of your collateral package and borrow against it. Or take six months to go through a whole set of due diligence to try to set up a new set of account and rebuild all your accounting systems and rebuild your vendor relationships and then carve $20 million out of your capital where you could not margin it and you couldn't borrow against it. And as you can imagine, that's -- it's not 10x target, it's probably 100x or 1,000x harder for a financial adviser to acquire Bitcoin without that simple ETF. So I think ETFs are really important to institutional adoption. And we got our first two ETFs in the past week. There's another 40 that are in the application process. I think the writing is on the wall. There will be more ETFs coming at a certain rate. I think that it's another check box that an institutional investor would go through. I think that the lack of FDIC guidance would hold back the development of the asset class. But as I've said on Twitter, when the -- when that guidance is clear, there's a lot more demand to own this asset, and there'll be almost -- there's going to be much less demand to sell the asset because if the banks can hold the asset and collateralize the asset and extend the loan against the asset, right, then what you're going to see is a dramatic lessening of the supply available for sale. So what we see right now is a difficulty with regard to the accounting. It's a challenge. If you're a CFO and you want -- and you're maintaining a pristine P&L and a pristine balance sheet, taking on billions of dollars of Bitcoin. And during the volatility of that would result in operating losses that are just due to the Bitcoin volatility or a markdown of your assets due to Bitcoin volatility, and that would cause you to slow down your acquisition. So I think the FDIC issue, the FASB issue and the ETF issue, they're are all things that slow down the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, but they're also -- they're also items that -- it's pretty clear the writing is on the wall sometime in the coming few years they will be resolved, right? There seems to be a sentiment at FASB, at the FDIC and at the SEC that these issues should be addressed. So knowing that's the case, right? And then looking at Bitcoin in general, we see that Bitcoin is up 300-plus percent in 12 months. What I've said jokingly is you almost wouldn't want the problems to be solved much faster than they've been solved. If we went much faster, I mean, you could imagine a Bitcoin went up 1,000% in a year we might very well rip the wings off the airplane. It just -- it would be too fast. And so I think that there's pretty clear sentiment amongst regulators and amongst Congress and throughout the world that digital assets are here to stay, that crypto economy needs to be addressed, it needs to be brought into standard public policy frameworks. And the Bitcoin itself is property, Satoshi's innovation is real, and this is good for the western world. And so I see those as suspicious. I also think the -- we can see signs of the development in the Bitcoin banking sector. Today I published a press release from NYDIG, where NYDIG is actually offering credit lines against Bitcoin in order to buy cars. And so that's very interesting. If you can actually buy things by pledging Bitcoin as collateral, we're going to see, I think, a change in sentiment that more and more people are going to see Bitcoin as the pristine collateral. And at that point you flip from being a seller so that you can buy your Lamborghini to being a borrower or a buyer so that you can wait for it to appreciate so you can borrow against it to buy your Lamborghini. It's a very subtle change. And I know I'm using a retail example. But I think the same is true with institutions. I think that if you're an institution and you bought $1 billion worth of Apple stock, and it was with your prime brokerage and you could borrow against it at LIBOR or SOFR plus 50 basis points up to 50% loan-to-value, I think you can bargain Apple stock at more like 80% loan-to-value. So you could borrow $800 million at less than 1% interest against Apple stock with your prime brokerage, making that decision in minutes. Now if you had to take the entire $1 billion, pull it out of your prime brokerage and go set up a different account and go through the KYC AML and go through due diligence, and then if I told you it was not going to be collateralizable. Now instead of having $1 billion and being able to draw down another $800 million, you have a 6-month exercise and your $800 million went to 0. You can see that you're discouraged from supporting the asset class or moving into it as we solve this problem as the big institutional Bitcoin exchanges like coin-based and fidelity, build their institutional accounts. That's one way we solved the problem. The second way the problem in solved is the FDIC starts to give guidance or clarity. And if that happens, right, then you would see major banks moving into the custody and other services. And the third way we see the problem getting solved is, is many of the larger banks start to handle trading of digital assets through their trading desks, and we're starting to see that taking place more often. And then the fourth way is the ETFs mature. And as the ETFs mature, they don't give access to the Bitcoin property, but they give access to the security. And the security itself is collateral against the prime brokerage account. And so the securities available dramatically decreased the barriers to entry. And we're seeing a dramatic increase in Bitcoin securities in the past three months for a couple of reasons. One is the spread of the ETFs and ETF-like instruments. And the second is the number of Bitcoin miners that are coming public. And I think it's a consistent theme. We see more miners. We see Hut eight that has been listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. We see Argo getting listed on the NASDAQ or the American stock exchanges. We see other companies that are coming public or have plans to come public, either through SPACs or through direct IPOs. I think that you're going to continue to see more and more companies that are either Bitcoin miners or Bitcoin-linked or bit coined ETFs or the like. Those are on-ramps for institutional investors to get exposure via their prime brokerage arrangements through their conventional accounting systems, with their conventional business models. And in some cases, some cases the funds have charter requirements to hold securities rather than property or they're looking for different types of securities, like they want equities or they need to be a certain capitalization size or they're looking for debt instruments in order to get exposure. So if I were to roll the clock back nine months, very little of what I've just said was in the public domain. So the last nine months have been pretty dramatic. The past three months, extremely dramatic maturing of the asset class because of the successful redeployment of the Bitcoin mining network to North America following the China crackdown and because of many, many constructive developments that have taken place in the regulatory front. I think you could -- you could put your finger on one more thing, which is interesting, which is the Bitcoin integration with technology firms like Square, Twitter, Robinhood. Square has continued to improve the bit corn functionality, allowing people that are interested in acquiring Bitcoin property to quickly buy it on the Square Cash App and also move it quickly and easily via Square Cashtags. And that's pretty important. And there are millions and millions of people that are being touched that way and being served that way. I think that when Twitter integrated Bitcoin tipping into Twitter, I think that was a big development in the ecosystem. It's possible to actually dramatically improve the cybersecurity of Twitter or Facebook or YouTube or Google or Office 365 or any social media or communications network using Bitcoin and Lightning. And I think the tip of the iceberg was Twitter and tips. But we really are at just the tip of the iceberg. I think that there's a profound game-changing dynamics here with big tech and Bitcoin. And you can see it in the demand for functionality with Square. You can see it with the integration of Bitcoin into Twitter. You can see in the comments of many executives. I think the CFO of Twitter referred to the possibilities that an open monitoring network like Bitcoin offer. I think we saw an extraordinary thing take place this quarter in El Salvador, where more than, I think, 3 million people downloaded a Chivo wallet, which is a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. More people now have a Bitcoin bank account via that Lightning wallet and Chivo then got a bank account in 100 years via the conventional banking system. So I think there's a gradual growing awareness that the 20th Century banking system is 1,000x as expensive as the 21st century banking system. The future of banking is I download a mobile app in 60 seconds, I turn it on and I have a bank, and my variable cost is 0. I don't have to buy the phone, I already own the phone. I don't have to pay for the network, I already on the network, right? If your vision is, let's give banks to 2 billion people by building bricks-and-mortar institutions and running everything through the Fed wire and negotiating central bank protocols and going through 20th century methods and regimens, then I think you realize that's just not going to work. If your idea is let's just upload a mobile app and let 20 -- or 2 billion people download it from the Android store or the iPhone store for 0, that will probably work. We know that will work. You can see that's how we spread music and free books and Google and WhatsApp and the like. So we saw that example at a nation-state level this quarter with El Salvador. And not only did they successfully deploy to 3 million people, they also began to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet and they started buying Bitcoin for -- on behalf of their people, and that's an extraordinary example. And I think it has a lot of people thinking right now. I think the other example we can see is with Robinhood where Robinhood lets their users trade cryptocurrency, and there was a massive demand to integrate Bitcoin withdrawal capability into the Robinhood app. And I think they have more than 1 million people on the waiting list for that functionality now. So I think that the writing is on the wall. And the writing is if you want to be a competitive big tech provider of payments or big tech provider of financial services or banking services or investment services or trading services, you're going to have to support Bitcoin. You're probably going to need to support Lightning wallets. So Bitcoin wallets, Lightning wallets and then open up the network and you can see extraordinary enthusiasm for those companies that are doing it and extraordinary pressure on those that either don't do it or do it in an incomplete fashion. So what's the summary of all of this? I think the summary is what we see is the emergence of the digital gold asset class. When we first bought Bitcoin in our first press release we said we bought Bitcoin because we view it as digital gold. It's harder, smarter, faster and stronger than gold. And a lot of people scratched their head and they weren't sure about it. But if we fast forward a year, Bitcoin is up more than 300%, gold is down 3% or 4%. In a year of political unrest and monetary inflation, gold is neither a hedge against political unrest, nor is it a hedged against inflation. Bitcoin is doing the job 10x better than the S&P index or the NASDAQ index is doing the job. And at this point, you have all of the Indicia that you would need in order to conclude Bitcoin is digital gold. The regulators are treating it as an asset. It's not going to be banned. It is being brought into the regulatory and public policy framework and recognized as an institutional-grade asset. There are institutional ETFs for that asset. We see examples of why it's better than gold, the fact that we can move it faster. We saw 3 million people able to access Bitcoin via Lightning in a matter of weeks. So we see the speed, we see that it is faster. We see that it is smarter. I can deliver it via the iOS and Android apps. We see that it is stronger. We can do -- there's no way you could have actually given $30 worth of gold to everybody in El Salvador in three weeks. You probably couldn't do it all. If you gave it $30 of gold, the transaction costs would have been like a markup of like 37%, right. So you just can't do it. And so what we see here is Bitcoin is meeting that requirement, how do we give a store value asset to millions and millions of people on a mobile phone. And how do we make it harder than gold. Well, I think 130% a year improvement for a decade is one indicator, but 350% improvement in a year is even a better indicator. So what we see is a new asset class forming. And a year ago, I think it would be reasonable to say, I'm not sure if institutions will embrace this. But I think right now, if you look at the public results that have been published by Coinbase in an 8,000 or 9,000 institutional accounts they have and if you look at the actions of the SEC and improving ETFs and if you look at the words of our regulators in front of Congress in congressional testimony and if you look at the words of our senators and if you listen to the words and read the testimony of our central bankers, I think it's very, very clear. This is a -- it's a scarce digital store of value asset. Yes, it may be viewed as speculative, and that's okay. And it is volatile, and that's okay. But my view here is it's volatile because it's integrated into the entire crypto economy, and there's a lot of ambiguity and a lot of leverage in the crypto economy that is yet to be worked out. And as regulatory clarity comes to the crypto economy and as we normalize many of these assets, and we resolve the question of the handling of stable coins and the handling of other tokens, as these things get worked out and as we resolve the question of how much leverage can you use to trade this and where, all of those things are going to lessen the volatility. And until that time, the volatility is probably an asset, it's probably helping with the adoption. The volatility is attracting the best and the brightest minds of the entire generation to Bitcoin. If you're a 20-something with a little bit of capital trading in Singapore, right, you're not going to trade gold versus silver. You're not going to trade commodities. You're not going to trade equities. You're going to trade in the crypto market because there's opportunity there. And the volatility itself is an opportunity to arbitrage. And as this complexity gets worked out, the entire asset class strengthens. So I guess you could summarize that as we feel like everything is evolving according to plan as well as it could evolve. And everything that's happened is pretty much as expected, you have an emerging asset class that the world needs. And the world is struggling to figure out how to bring it into its public policy frameworks so that we can all use it in order to build the 21st entry cyber economy, where it's pretty clear we need a digital asset like Bitcoin because it is smarter, it is faster, it is stronger, it is harder. I can program it into any computer. I can deliver it to billions of phones. I can move it at the speed of light. I can't do that with any other bearer asset. And I can't do that in the conventional 20th century banking system. So Bitcoin is the future. And everything that happened in the past quarter, I think, is bullish for the asset class and makes us even more optimistic about our business strategy here. So with that, I think we're ready for questions.\nA - Jeremy Price: All right. Thank you, Michael. We do have a lot of good questions. So we're going to try and get through as many as we can. And with no further ado, here we go. For Phong, \"Non-GAAP operating margin in Q3 came in above expectations for -- of 18% to 19%. Could you walk us through the main drivers of the margin outperformance? Thank you and congratulations.\"\nPhong Le: Thank you, Jeremy. I would say it's one major outperformance driver. We had a tough compare going into this quarter. So I think folks thought that our revenues were going to be down a little bit. In fact, our total revenues were up. Our software revenues were up substantially versus 2019. We had good consulting results. So if I was to net it out, revenue growth is good. Software business is going well. There is incremental customer demand for the MicroStrategy platform. And it all creates a good momentum for us as a business. And of course, we've been able to keep our costs an order as much as we can to. So that's what's driving the margin outperformance right now.\nJeremy Price: All right. Thanks, Phong Le. Michael, \"Some Bitcoin miners are getting interest from asset managers who are evaluating financing their own mining operation inside larger miners with capacity. They believe that the returns on self-mining of the five years might be greater than buying . What are your views here?\"\nMichael Saylor: So, ask the question again. I want to -- like my views of what versus what?\nJeremy Price: Bitcoin miners are getting interest from asset managers who are evaluating financing their own mining operations inside of larger miners with capacity. They think that the returns on self-mining over five years might be greater than buying spot or\"\nMichael Saylor: So the question is, is it better to buy Bitcoin or buy a Bitcoin miner, is that what that means?\nJeremy Price: Yes.\nMichael Saylor: I mean -- but I wouldn't say -- what I would say is I think the Bitcoin miners are in a great industry. It's a good business. There's a natural limit on how much hash power can be delivered because one constrain is, is the supply of short  miners. And the second constrain is, the time it takes to build out an engineered mining facility. And so if you are lucky -- if you wanted to go and create a Bitcoin miner today, you might have to wait 12 to 24 months to get the mining rigs. And then you might have to struggle for 12 to 24 months to build out your facility. And so it's going to take time for that hash power to come online. And in that time, that means if you have a mining operation with good hash power, right, you're in a great position. And of course their business was made better by the China exodus as well, which limited the hash power. I think that mining is a good business, but I can't tell you how to allocate your investment capital. I pointed out before, I think there are some investors that couldn't buy the property if they wanted to. I think there are other investors that have an agenda to buy companies. And so they need to buy miners. I think there are some investors that have an agenda to buy securities in general and/or they need to. So I think that right, there's demand for all these things. I think there's a demand for minor equity. I think there's a demand for minor debt. Like I think the miners can issue debt, and there's a market for that. And I think there's a market for Bitcoin. And I think that all of those markets will grow and those options are going to increase in the coming few quarters.\nJeremy Price: Thanks, Michael. Phong, \"Can you provide\" -- sorry, \"Nice to see the sustained strong R&D spend. Can you provide more detail on where you're focusing these investments? And how should we expect MicroStrategy's platform to evolve in the coming years? Is there any of your R&D spend being invested in Bitcoin and blockchain related research?\nPhong Le: Yes. So first of all, we're going to continue to grow R&D spend. It's the right place to invest. We'll find synergies and be able to reduce costs in other areas like sales and marketing and G&A, invest that in R&D and grow our margins. If you look at the last year versus this year, we've tripled the amount of money we spent in R&D and cloud. So building out a full multi-tenant containerized cloud platform. We've done that. Now extending that to multi-cloud and extending that to all of our customers is a big focus of ours, and we're seeing good momentum there. Improving or investing more in security. We're the most secure enterprise-grade BI platform in the world. A lot is changing in that area. And so we're going to continue to invest there. We've tripled our investments in security last year. Continue to build out OEM capabilities, so that you can embed our software and any other piece of software and any client application and making sure that our software is open. That's a big area of investment. We've doubled our investment in that area in the last year. And of course, probably the biggest area of investment we continue to work on is making our software intuitive, improving the client user experience. So innovations like Hyperintelligence and more extensions beyond that augmented capabilities. So we're the number one enterprise-grade BI platform in the world, and we expect to continue to do so through R&D investments.\nJeremy Price: Thanks, Phong. Let's do one more. We've had quite a few questions about this. So let's start with Mike, and I'm sure Phong you have something to say. \"How should we think about the underlying value of Bitcoin versus the market cap of the company? And what appears to be a shrinking premium over the quarter?\"\nMichael Saylor: I think that clearly the stock price will fluctuate and the market determines that. Our view is we're going to grow the enterprise software business using intelligent investments and making intelligent investments in the product line. And we're going to grow the Bitcoin business by acquiring more Bitcoin via accretive method, so via intelligent financings from time to time. And the marketplace will react to those things and it will react to other things in the market that are out of our control.\nPhong Le: And the only thing I might add to that is the stock price, I agree it is what it is, but we offer something that's differentiated and unique. We have a business intelligence company that's growing, that's the best enterprise platform in the world and produces material and growing cash flow, we can invest that in Bitcoin. We can take our Bitcoin strategy and invest additional capital through raising debt, raising equity. And our Bitcoin strategy makes us more known in the marketplace, increases our pipeline grows, our popularity and in turn makes our enterprise software company stronger. So it's a virtuous cycle, and I think that's something that's quite unique compared to just buying spot Bitcoin or investing in a stand-alone software company.\nJeremy Price: Thanks, Phong. I thank everyone for their questions. I'm going to turn it back over to Michael for our closing remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Okay. Well, thank you. I want to thank everybody for being with us today. And we appreciate your support for our shareholders in the audience. We couldn't do this without you. We're really as enthusiastic as ever about both our enterprise software strategy and our Bitcoin strategy. We'll continue to execute on both of those in the coming quarter. And we'll look forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks when we report back how things went. Until then have a good year and a good holiday season.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. I'm Michael Saylor, the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our third quarter 2021 financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who's going to provide an update on our operations and our financials for the quarter. Thank you, Phong. I'll make a few comments on MicroStrategy and its business intelligence business, our macrostrategy and our Bitcoin acquisition plans. And then on the outlook for Bitcoin in general. So why don't we start with micro strategy. As Phong has pointed out, the business is running very, very well operationally. Every quarter for the last eight quarters we've got operationally more efficient. We're profitable. We're generating a very healthy operating margin. And I'm very pleased with the stability and the maturity of that business. I mean, the three key themes that we would focus on will be the shift to modern analytics from the legacy BI vendors. And we're benefiting by having made large investments to modernize our platform, and we offer an upgrade path that has a future to large enterprises that made their BI decisions back in the 2000 to 2010 time frame. Many of them are running on architectures that have languished for the past 5 to 10 years, and they're looking for something which is fresh and vital and modern. So we do win a lot of business there. And I think that that trend will continue. It probably will be even more of an important trend in the next few years. The shift to enterprise cloud continues. As Phong had pointed out, in some cases companies can't, but we think that there'll be a steady progression of motion from on-premises installations to cloud installations. And as that happens, we're able to add value and improve the overall value proposition of MicroStrategy. And also, that just improves the operational efficiency of our company and it improves the operational efficiency of our customers. So everyone in the world is looking for more operational efficiencies. How do I get newer technology that runs more efficiently within my enterprise. And certainly the shift to enterprise Cloud is consistent with that. The third theme that we continue to see is the increased prevalence of embedded analytics. Our customers looking to OEM or analytics or embed our analytics into their applications that are facing their customers and their constituencies. And microstrategies made huge investments and a broad-based set of investments and initiatives in order to provide powerful SDKs and APIs and embedding capability. And so that's helped us as well. I think that the business will continue to be driven by those three dynamics, and we're very optimistic about where they'll take us. Shifting subjects to our macro strategy to acquire and to hold Bitcoin. Most of you have followed that journey. Following our Dutch auction, which ended in September of last year, we acquired more Bitcoin. And then following our first convert, we were able to acquire more Bitcoin. Then a second convert to acquire more Bitcoin, then a senior secured debt offering to acquire more Bitcoin. And then an at-the-market equity offering to acquire more Bitcoin. And along the way, we used operating cash flows and other free cash flows from the business to acquire more Bitcoin. There is no one answer to how we go about acquiring Bitcoin. We are committed to continue to acquire Bitcoin. We don't have a plan to sell Bitcoin. We're going to keep the Bitcoin. For those of you who follow me on Twitter, I've pointed out that you should not sell you Bitcoin. We believe that Bitcoin represents a great long-term investment for the shareholders. So we're constantly evaluating the Bitcoin market and the market for our equity and the debt markets, both the convertible debt markets and the senior debt markets and other options, just to consider whether there is an opportunity for a capital raise that makes sense. We had a $1 billion ATM, but as many of you will notice, we didn't execute the entire $1 billion in the quarter. We thought that the $400 million that we did execute was accretive to the shareholders. And the timing of it was opportunistic. We felt that it was a wise management decision to sell the equity and to buy Bitcoin at the time we did. There'll be other windows where we'll think something different. At times we thought the most accretive action was a convertible debt issuance. But back in the second quarter we decided that a senior secured note was more accretive. It's impossible for us to know exactly what the right activity is going to be going forward because the markets are continually changing. We keep our options open. And we work to make sure that we can move with alacrity if we need to, in order to seize an opportunity. Looking forward, we're open to partnerships that allow us to acquire more Bitcoin. We're open to credit lines that might allow us to acquire more Bitcoin. We're open to asset-backed financing that might allow us to acquire more Bitcoin. And we will just continually evaluate these things. With regard to Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin is a pretty hot topic right now across the political media, across the financial media, across cyber space. I think that the things that are worth focusing on are the institutional maturity of the asset class has taken place over the past three months. We came into the year with two existential risk, will the Chinese be able to control Bitcoin or will a government ban Bitcoin. And it turns out that the China exodus resulted in the United States, North American Bitcoin miners becoming leaders in the Bitcoin mining business. And so a big question about whether China could control or wanted to control Bitcoin was taken off the table. The second question is, would it be banned? As I've met with institutional investors and all interested figures. The most common question is, well, it seems to be so good in every respect, it's so perfect that surely there's a catch. I guess the government may want to regulate it or ban it. And we got beyond the -- well, what is it technically, and what does it do, and why would you want to own it? It all came down to, well, it just seems to be too good to be true, someone's going to ban it. And I think the last 12 weeks have been really instrumental in putting that fear to rest. First of all, when the Chinese cracked down on Bitcoin mining, they didn't ban the ownership of Bitcoin, and that was an interesting nuance. Second, we had senatorial hearings and congressional hearings where we saw a broad array of senators express support for Bitcoin. And we saw a broad array, a bipartisan array of congressmen and Congress people express support for Bitcoin. And so we can see Congress and Senate are very supportive. We've seen people ask point blank at Treasury, at the SEC, at the CFTC, do you have any intention to ban cryptocurrencies? And the answer is no. And specifically with regard to Bitcoin, I think it's quite clear that within treasury, within the CFTC, within the SEC and with the EU Central Bank, there's no intention to block institutions from owning this asset. It's been referred to as a scarce speculative digital asset or store of value asset. And I think the clarity that's come into the marketplace is that it's not a currency, it is an asset. It's going to be taxed as an asset, which means on sale you would pay a capital gain, short or long-term capital gain of sorts. It's not going to be treated as a medium in exchange or a currency in the western world, most of the world, with just a few exceptions. I think that that's provided clarity for institutional investors. So the commentary from the SEC, the treasury, the Senate, Congress, I think was probably one of the most important things that happened in the quarter. I think that we just saw the chair of the FDIC express interest in working through the necessary guidance to allow banks to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet. And I thought that was very auspicious. I think the fact that FASB is willing to take up this matter, at least asking for comments from the community on Bitcoin accounting is very auspicious. And the hundreds and hundreds of responses from institutional investors, from publicly traded companies from audit firms, from professional firms, from individual investors that were returned to FASB were very auspicious. And there is a general sentiment in the marketplace that this is a very important issue for regulators to take up. So we've moved beyond the will it be banned to the -- it's clearly an innovation, and it's a basis for the 21st century economy, and it's very important to financial innovation and technology leadership of the western world. I think that being the case, that removed a big hurdle for many institutional investors to own Bitcoin. I think another big hurdle has been the lack of an ETF because all of the financial advisers of which there is 220,000, I guess, in the U.S., holding or controlling $100 trillion of assets, those financial advisers couldn't buy Bitcoin with their existing prime brokerage accounts, with their existing accounting systems or be compensated for that Bitcoin. That's a big deal. That's the difference between being able to take 60 seconds and buy $20 million and have it part of your collateral package and borrow against it. Or take six months to go through a whole set of due diligence to try to set up a new set of account and rebuild all your accounting systems and rebuild your vendor relationships and then carve $20 million out of your capital where you could not margin it and you couldn't borrow against it. And as you can imagine, that's -- it's not 10x target, it's probably 100x or 1,000x harder for a financial adviser to acquire Bitcoin without that simple ETF. So I think ETFs are really important to institutional adoption. And we got our first two ETFs in the past week. There's another 40 that are in the application process. I think the writing is on the wall. There will be more ETFs coming at a certain rate. I think that it's another check box that an institutional investor would go through. I think that the lack of FDIC guidance would hold back the development of the asset class. But as I've said on Twitter, when the -- when that guidance is clear, there's a lot more demand to own this asset, and there'll be almost -- there's going to be much less demand to sell the asset because if the banks can hold the asset and collateralize the asset and extend the loan against the asset, right, then what you're going to see is a dramatic lessening of the supply available for sale. So what we see right now is a difficulty with regard to the accounting. It's a challenge. If you're a CFO and you want -- and you're maintaining a pristine P&L and a pristine balance sheet, taking on billions of dollars of Bitcoin. And during the volatility of that would result in operating losses that are just due to the Bitcoin volatility or a markdown of your assets due to Bitcoin volatility, and that would cause you to slow down your acquisition. So I think the FDIC issue, the FASB issue and the ETF issue, they're are all things that slow down the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, but they're also -- they're also items that -- it's pretty clear the writing is on the wall sometime in the coming few years they will be resolved, right? There seems to be a sentiment at FASB, at the FDIC and at the SEC that these issues should be addressed. So knowing that's the case, right? And then looking at Bitcoin in general, we see that Bitcoin is up 300-plus percent in 12 months. What I've said jokingly is you almost wouldn't want the problems to be solved much faster than they've been solved. If we went much faster, I mean, you could imagine a Bitcoin went up 1,000% in a year we might very well rip the wings off the airplane. It just -- it would be too fast. And so I think that there's pretty clear sentiment amongst regulators and amongst Congress and throughout the world that digital assets are here to stay, that crypto economy needs to be addressed, it needs to be brought into standard public policy frameworks. And the Bitcoin itself is property, Satoshi's innovation is real, and this is good for the western world. And so I see those as suspicious. I also think the -- we can see signs of the development in the Bitcoin banking sector. Today I published a press release from NYDIG, where NYDIG is actually offering credit lines against Bitcoin in order to buy cars. And so that's very interesting. If you can actually buy things by pledging Bitcoin as collateral, we're going to see, I think, a change in sentiment that more and more people are going to see Bitcoin as the pristine collateral. And at that point you flip from being a seller so that you can buy your Lamborghini to being a borrower or a buyer so that you can wait for it to appreciate so you can borrow against it to buy your Lamborghini. It's a very subtle change. And I know I'm using a retail example. But I think the same is true with institutions. I think that if you're an institution and you bought $1 billion worth of Apple stock, and it was with your prime brokerage and you could borrow against it at LIBOR or SOFR plus 50 basis points up to 50% loan-to-value, I think you can bargain Apple stock at more like 80% loan-to-value. So you could borrow $800 million at less than 1% interest against Apple stock with your prime brokerage, making that decision in minutes. Now if you had to take the entire $1 billion, pull it out of your prime brokerage and go set up a different account and go through the KYC AML and go through due diligence, and then if I told you it was not going to be collateralizable. Now instead of having $1 billion and being able to draw down another $800 million, you have a 6-month exercise and your $800 million went to 0. You can see that you're discouraged from supporting the asset class or moving into it as we solve this problem as the big institutional Bitcoin exchanges like coin-based and fidelity, build their institutional accounts. That's one way we solved the problem. The second way the problem in solved is the FDIC starts to give guidance or clarity. And if that happens, right, then you would see major banks moving into the custody and other services. And the third way we see the problem getting solved is, is many of the larger banks start to handle trading of digital assets through their trading desks, and we're starting to see that taking place more often. And then the fourth way is the ETFs mature. And as the ETFs mature, they don't give access to the Bitcoin property, but they give access to the security. And the security itself is collateral against the prime brokerage account. And so the securities available dramatically decreased the barriers to entry. And we're seeing a dramatic increase in Bitcoin securities in the past three months for a couple of reasons. One is the spread of the ETFs and ETF-like instruments. And the second is the number of Bitcoin miners that are coming public. And I think it's a consistent theme. We see more miners. We see Hut eight that has been listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. We see Argo getting listed on the NASDAQ or the American stock exchanges. We see other companies that are coming public or have plans to come public, either through SPACs or through direct IPOs. I think that you're going to continue to see more and more companies that are either Bitcoin miners or Bitcoin-linked or bit coined ETFs or the like. Those are on-ramps for institutional investors to get exposure via their prime brokerage arrangements through their conventional accounting systems, with their conventional business models. And in some cases, some cases the funds have charter requirements to hold securities rather than property or they're looking for different types of securities, like they want equities or they need to be a certain capitalization size or they're looking for debt instruments in order to get exposure. So if I were to roll the clock back nine months, very little of what I've just said was in the public domain. So the last nine months have been pretty dramatic. The past three months, extremely dramatic maturing of the asset class because of the successful redeployment of the Bitcoin mining network to North America following the China crackdown and because of many, many constructive developments that have taken place in the regulatory front. I think you could -- you could put your finger on one more thing, which is interesting, which is the Bitcoin integration with technology firms like Square, Twitter, Robinhood. Square has continued to improve the bit corn functionality, allowing people that are interested in acquiring Bitcoin property to quickly buy it on the Square Cash App and also move it quickly and easily via Square Cashtags. And that's pretty important. And there are millions and millions of people that are being touched that way and being served that way. I think that when Twitter integrated Bitcoin tipping into Twitter, I think that was a big development in the ecosystem. It's possible to actually dramatically improve the cybersecurity of Twitter or Facebook or YouTube or Google or Office 365 or any social media or communications network using Bitcoin and Lightning. And I think the tip of the iceberg was Twitter and tips. But we really are at just the tip of the iceberg. I think that there's a profound game-changing dynamics here with big tech and Bitcoin. And you can see it in the demand for functionality with Square. You can see it with the integration of Bitcoin into Twitter. You can see in the comments of many executives. I think the CFO of Twitter referred to the possibilities that an open monitoring network like Bitcoin offer. I think we saw an extraordinary thing take place this quarter in El Salvador, where more than, I think, 3 million people downloaded a Chivo wallet, which is a Bitcoin Lightning wallet. More people now have a Bitcoin bank account via that Lightning wallet and Chivo then got a bank account in 100 years via the conventional banking system. So I think there's a gradual growing awareness that the 20th Century banking system is 1,000x as expensive as the 21st century banking system. The future of banking is I download a mobile app in 60 seconds, I turn it on and I have a bank, and my variable cost is 0. I don't have to buy the phone, I already own the phone. I don't have to pay for the network, I already on the network, right? If your vision is, let's give banks to 2 billion people by building bricks-and-mortar institutions and running everything through the Fed wire and negotiating central bank protocols and going through 20th century methods and regimens, then I think you realize that's just not going to work. If your idea is let's just upload a mobile app and let 20 -- or 2 billion people download it from the Android store or the iPhone store for 0, that will probably work. We know that will work. You can see that's how we spread music and free books and Google and WhatsApp and the like. So we saw that example at a nation-state level this quarter with El Salvador. And not only did they successfully deploy to 3 million people, they also began to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet and they started buying Bitcoin for -- on behalf of their people, and that's an extraordinary example. And I think it has a lot of people thinking right now. I think the other example we can see is with Robinhood where Robinhood lets their users trade cryptocurrency, and there was a massive demand to integrate Bitcoin withdrawal capability into the Robinhood app. And I think they have more than 1 million people on the waiting list for that functionality now. So I think that the writing is on the wall. And the writing is if you want to be a competitive big tech provider of payments or big tech provider of financial services or banking services or investment services or trading services, you're going to have to support Bitcoin. You're probably going to need to support Lightning wallets. So Bitcoin wallets, Lightning wallets and then open up the network and you can see extraordinary enthusiasm for those companies that are doing it and extraordinary pressure on those that either don't do it or do it in an incomplete fashion. So what's the summary of all of this? I think the summary is what we see is the emergence of the digital gold asset class. When we first bought Bitcoin in our first press release we said we bought Bitcoin because we view it as digital gold. It's harder, smarter, faster and stronger than gold. And a lot of people scratched their head and they weren't sure about it. But if we fast forward a year, Bitcoin is up more than 300%, gold is down 3% or 4%. In a year of political unrest and monetary inflation, gold is neither a hedge against political unrest, nor is it a hedged against inflation. Bitcoin is doing the job 10x better than the S&P index or the NASDAQ index is doing the job. And at this point, you have all of the Indicia that you would need in order to conclude Bitcoin is digital gold. The regulators are treating it as an asset. It's not going to be banned. It is being brought into the regulatory and public policy framework and recognized as an institutional-grade asset. There are institutional ETFs for that asset. We see examples of why it's better than gold, the fact that we can move it faster. We saw 3 million people able to access Bitcoin via Lightning in a matter of weeks. So we see the speed, we see that it is faster. We see that it is smarter. I can deliver it via the iOS and Android apps. We see that it is stronger. We can do -- there's no way you could have actually given $30 worth of gold to everybody in El Salvador in three weeks. You probably couldn't do it all. If you gave it $30 of gold, the transaction costs would have been like a markup of like 37%, right. So you just can't do it. And so what we see here is Bitcoin is meeting that requirement, how do we give a store value asset to millions and millions of people on a mobile phone. And how do we make it harder than gold. Well, I think 130% a year improvement for a decade is one indicator, but 350% improvement in a year is even a better indicator. So what we see is a new asset class forming. And a year ago, I think it would be reasonable to say, I'm not sure if institutions will embrace this. But I think right now, if you look at the public results that have been published by Coinbase in an 8,000 or 9,000 institutional accounts they have and if you look at the actions of the SEC and improving ETFs and if you look at the words of our regulators in front of Congress in congressional testimony and if you look at the words of our senators and if you listen to the words and read the testimony of our central bankers, I think it's very, very clear. This is a -- it's a scarce digital store of value asset. Yes, it may be viewed as speculative, and that's okay. And it is volatile, and that's okay. But my view here is it's volatile because it's integrated into the entire crypto economy, and there's a lot of ambiguity and a lot of leverage in the crypto economy that is yet to be worked out. And as regulatory clarity comes to the crypto economy and as we normalize many of these assets, and we resolve the question of the handling of stable coins and the handling of other tokens, as these things get worked out and as we resolve the question of how much leverage can you use to trade this and where, all of those things are going to lessen the volatility. And until that time, the volatility is probably an asset, it's probably helping with the adoption. The volatility is attracting the best and the brightest minds of the entire generation to Bitcoin. If you're a 20-something with a little bit of capital trading in Singapore, right, you're not going to trade gold versus silver. You're not going to trade commodities. You're not going to trade equities. You're going to trade in the crypto market because there's opportunity there. And the volatility itself is an opportunity to arbitrage. And as this complexity gets worked out, the entire asset class strengthens. So I guess you could summarize that as we feel like everything is evolving according to plan as well as it could evolve. And everything that's happened is pretty much as expected, you have an emerging asset class that the world needs. And the world is struggling to figure out how to bring it into its public policy frameworks so that we can all use it in order to build the 21st entry cyber economy, where it's pretty clear we need a digital asset like Bitcoin because it is smarter, it is faster, it is stronger, it is harder. I can program it into any computer. I can deliver it to billions of phones. I can move it at the speed of light. I can't do that with any other bearer asset. And I can't do that in the conventional 20th century banking system. So Bitcoin is the future. And everything that happened in the past quarter, I think, is bullish for the asset class and makes us even more optimistic about our business strategy here. So with that, I think we're ready for questions. So, ask the question again. I want to -- like my views of what versus what? So the question is, is it better to buy Bitcoin or buy a Bitcoin miner, is that what that means? I mean -- but I wouldn't say -- what I would say is I think the Bitcoin miners are in a great industry. It's a good business. There's a natural limit on how much hash power can be delivered because one constrain is, is the supply of short  miners. And the second constrain is, the time it takes to build out an engineered mining facility. And so if you are lucky -- if you wanted to go and create a Bitcoin miner today, you might have to wait 12 to 24 months to get the mining rigs. And then you might have to struggle for 12 to 24 months to build out your facility. And so it's going to take time for that hash power to come online. And in that time, that means if you have a mining operation with good hash power, right, you're in a great position. And of course their business was made better by the China exodus as well, which limited the hash power. I think that mining is a good business, but I can't tell you how to allocate your investment capital. I pointed out before, I think there are some investors that couldn't buy the property if they wanted to. I think there are other investors that have an agenda to buy companies. And so they need to buy miners. I think there are some investors that have an agenda to buy securities in general and/or they need to. So I think that right, there's demand for all these things. I think there's a demand for minor equity. I think there's a demand for minor debt. Like I think the miners can issue debt, and there's a market for that. And I think there's a market for Bitcoin. And I think that all of those markets will grow and those options are going to increase in the coming few quarters. I think that clearly the stock price will fluctuate and the market determines that. Our view is we're going to grow the enterprise software business using intelligent investments and making intelligent investments in the product line. And we're going to grow the Bitcoin business by acquiring more Bitcoin via accretive method, so via intelligent financings from time to time. And the marketplace will react to those things and it will react to other things in the market that are out of our control. Okay. Well, thank you. I want to thank everybody for being with us today. And we appreciate your support for our shareholders in the audience. We couldn't do this without you. We're really as enthusiastic as ever about both our enterprise software strategy and our Bitcoin strategy. We'll continue to execute on both of those in the coming quarter. And we'll look forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks when we report back how things went. Until then have a good year and a good holiday season."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. We're pleased with the performance in the third quarter across both of our strategic priorities. For the fifth straight quarter we posted strong financial and operational results with our software business and made investments in Bitcoin. Our enterprise analytics business delivered another strong quarter, and we are seeing growing adoption of the MicroStrategy platform, especially in the cloud by new and existing customers. We also had another active and successful quarter with our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, executing on our fourth successful capital raise in the past year and expanding our digital asset holdings. Our results in the third quarter are indicative of the multiple ways microstrategy is able to create meaningful and unique value for our shareholders. Total revenue in the quarter grew slightly year-over-year to $128 million. This is a strong performance against an incredibly difficult comp in the third quarter of 2020. As you might recall, in Q3 2020 we signed several deals that were delayed from the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 and signed a large expansion transaction with a major financial institution. Comparing against 2019, which adjusts for these impacts, total revenue grew 7% versus the third quarter of 2019. We think this is a good proxy for the underlying growth of the business. License revenue was down 13% year-over-year, but up 36% versus the third quarter of 2019. Subscription revenue in the quarter was up 31% compared to Q3 of 2020. Current subscription billings grew 23%, our sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Finally, we had another strong quarter of profitability with a non-GAAP operating income of $27.7 million and margin of 22%. MicroStrategy Cloud continues to become a growing mix of our business, while our on-prem product continues to perform well. We're committed to meeting the needs of our customers, regardless of how they would like to deploy MicroStrategy, some of whom operate in highly regulated industries or countries where a cloud deployment is not feasible. When you look at the overall growth of our subscription and license businesses, it is clear that underlying demand for our platform has demonstrated signs of strength. I'd like to highlight the three emerging trends in the data and analytics industry, acting as tailwinds for MicroStrategy. These trends are converging to create enterprise analytics super cycle, which is likely to widen the gap between organizations that are able to maximize their investments in data analytics and those that cannot. First, the demand for enterprise analytics has grown and has been accelerated due to the structural changes as a result of the pandemic. Enterprises are striving to stay ahead of changes in market trends, customer demand, supply chains and employee availability. The capacity to rapidly develop and deploy business and productivity applications to users at any location is now essential. To get there, the data-driven organizations are rushing to modernize their analytics as well as need data and business apps to the cloud. This market shift is putting pressure on legacy mega vendors who are prioritizing moving their ERP and infrastructure customers to cloud versus investing in their own BI applications. As enterprises now evaluate options to modernize their analytics and BI solutions, MicroStrategy has emerged as a logical vendor of choice because of its full-scale enterprise capabilities. A conclusion is substantiated by an accelerated replacement of legacy and  vendor BI platforms. Examples this quarter, our license deal, we won the largest hotel brands worldwide to replace Cognos for their entire property fleet as well as a big consulting deal with a leading media and entertainment company to migrate their legacy reports from business objects to MicroStrategy. The second trend is that proven solutions are replacing experimental initiatives. And enterprises are turning to trusted partners that deliver concrete results. According to a growing number of industry analysts, there is a notable reduction in organization's willingness to experiment with niche technologies in the times of macroeconomic uncertainty. In the short term, it leads to focus on customers. During this year, enterprises have prioritized the use of a unified platform that can deliver a broad set of use cases and are typically seeing significant cost savings through vendor consolidation. An example is a major win in a large insurance company to replace their suite of point experimental unproven VI solutions. The third trend is that the enterprises are now buying and not building analytics. To meet this demand, a growing number of OEMs as are supporting enterprises by developing solutions which require partnering with an open enterprise scale technology vendor. MicroStrategy is well positioned to benefit from this growing trend in the embedded analytics and OEM marketplace. We are #1 in the market in our embedded OEM business. We have seen an increased interest from new and existing customers that want to leverage our innovative business analytics platform as a core part of their technology solution. We believe our extensive investment in an open architecture driven by open APIs and SDKs provides OEMs with the best solution in the market. We experienced notable growth in both the number and size of OEM opportunities, including a deal with a multinational consumer credit reporting company and a deal with a video analytics company. Continuing with market sentiment. I'm also pleased to share that MicroStrategy was recognized with the Customers' Choice distinction in Gartner's latest Voice to the Customer report, which summarizes customer feedback on their BI platforms. We're now more than a year into our virtual wave strategy, and we have seen this approach can drive faster growth and greater productivity on a sustained basis. We're particularly pleased with our profitability performance with non-GAAP operating margin above 20%. This is the eighth straight quarter with an improvement in our year-over-year non-GAAP operating margin. To provide some context around our increase in sales productivity, our sales and marketing and G&A expenses on a trailing 12-month basis are down $34 million or 12% from fiscal year 2019 levels, while our product license revenue has grown 36% since Q3 2019, and subscription services revenue has grown 37% over that time. This translates to an increase in our sales productivity of 31% in the last year and 72% in the last three years. As a result, we repurposed some of those savings into R&D investments in areas like cloud, security, OEM, and new innovations to enhance our value proposition and lay the foundation for long-term durable growth. This is a virtuous cycle that we believe we can continue delivering on going forward. It's important to note that our pace of innovation is as impressive as it has been in many years with the company now produced quarterly and monthly software updates. Our team is working on a robust set of product features and enhancements that we believe will expand the value we provide customers and represent future incremental growth opportunities. To summarize our priorities, our focus going forward remains on moving to Cloud, expanding our OEM market share, modernizing our customer base and using our innovative offerings like HyperIntelligence to expand new prospects. Overall, I'm very pleased with the way our analytics business is performing. We are on the path of consistent growth, and we're confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth and profitability targets. Turning now to our Bitcoin strategy. We had another active and successful quarter. We raised approximately $400 million in capital through the sale of Class A common shares as part of our aftermarket offering during the quarter. We used the proceeds of this offering and excess cash to purchase an additional approximately 8,957 Bitcoins at an average price of $46,876 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. This is the fourth successful capital raise we've done in the past year, having raised $2.6 billion in new debt and equity capital that we deployed in support of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We have approximately $600 million remaining in our existing ATM facility, and we'll continue to be opportunistic in executing against it. Today, MicroStrategy owns approximately 114,042 Bitcoins that we acquired for a total cost of $3.2 billion or $27,713 per Bitcoin. The market value for our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $5 billion at September 30, 2021, reflecting $1.8 billion of unrealized gains or approximately 57% depreciation when compared to the cost basis of our Bitcoin at September 30, 2021. The book value of our BITCOIN holdings is $2.4 billion. As of yesterday, October 27, 2021, at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, the market price at one bit coin in our principal market was approximately $59,111, which equates to a market value of roughly $6.7 billion of Bitcoin, representing more than 110% depreciation. MicroStrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of enterprise's treasury policies, created billions of dollars of incremental value for our shareholders. And in doing so, established itself as one of the world's largest owners of Bitcoin. We will continue to evaluate opportunities to raise additional capital to execute on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has the potential to offer asymmetric upside to our shareholders. Before I turn to a more detailed review of this quarter's financial results, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the execution of both of our strategic priorities. As a result of our strong financial performance, year-to-date, the company is reaffirming our 2021 estimate of non-GAAP operating income of $80 million to $100 million. We also expect further acceleration of our cloud billings in Q4 2021 and going into 2022. We are excited to provide an update on our strategy later this quarter when we hold our 2021 Investor Day on December 2, 2021. We're looking forward to providing a deep dive, the future path of our enterprise analytics business and digital asset holdings and how it will benefit shareholders over time. Turning to our third quarter 2021 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $128 million, up slightly year-over-year and up 7% from the third quarter of 2019. Product license revenues were $25.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, down 13% year-over-year and up 36% from the third quarter of 2019. As mentioned earlier in the call, comparison with third quarter of 2019 is a good proxy for the underlying growth of the business due to the effects of COVID-19 and a large expansion transaction we signed with a major financial institution in the third quarter of 2020. Subscription services revenue in the third quarter of 2019 were $10.9 million, an increase of 31% year-over-year. The growth in subscription services revenue reflects a growing portion of our product bookings that are related to our cloud -- managed-cloud platform. Our current subscription billings in the third quarter of 2021 were $8 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the performance of our cloud business in the third quarter, and we'll look for growth to continue to accelerate. Product support revenues were $70.4 million in the third quarter of 2021, a decrease of 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by certain existing customers converting from perpetual product licenses to our subscription services or term license offerings. As we see more on-premise conversions to our cloud offering, we would anticipate product support revenue will experience a modest decline over time. Finally, other services revenue, which largely reflects our consulting services for $20.9 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 15% year-over-year. Improvements in consulting revenues is an indication of continued engagement from our customers to modernize and expand deployment of their MicroStrategy platform. Total GAAP expenses were $177.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, which includes the digital asset impairment charge of $65.2 million. Our Bitcoin holdings are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in our fair value below our book value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges. Total non-GAAP expenses were $100.3 million in the third quarter of 2021, a 1% decrease year-over-year. Total GAAP operating loss was $49.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, inclusive of an impairment charge related to Bitcoin of $65.2 million and stock-based compensation expense of $12.2 million. Total non-GAAP operating income was $27.7 million in the third quarter of 2021, a $1.1 million increase year-over-year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $57 million in cash. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of September 30, 2021, was $2.4 billion, which reflects an approximately $755 million in cumulative impairment charges that has also been reflected as a loss on our GAAP income statement in the period incurred. We exclude the quarterly impact of Bitcoin impairment charges from our non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share calculation. Bitcoin prices experienced relatively less dollar volatility in this quarter compared to the purchase prices, resulting in lower GAAP noncash impairment charge of approximately $65 million versus $425 million last quarter. As one of the leading advocates for digital assets, we've been working with peer companies and various policy setting agencies in the U.S. to try to determine a more appropriate accounting framework for digital assets. We recently wrote to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, FASB, that the disconnect between an entity's financial statements and the economic reality of its financial condition and results of operations, sales to provide investors, analysts and the general public with the information they need to make an informed assessment of an entity's current and future prospects. Currently, companies that aren't investment companies, report Bitcoin as intangible assets. This means that coin gets initially reported on balance sheet at its historic cost and then is deemed impaired at the market value ever dips. However, the carrying value can never conversely be revised upwards if the price of Bitcoin increases. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, we believe we have a responsibility to share what we've learned since embarking on this strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this new asset class. Going forward, you should continue to expect that we may purchase additional Bitcoin when our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed current working capital requirements, and we may from time to time, subject to market conditions, continue to issue debt or equity securities and capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin. Finally, we continue to be actively engaged in our search for the company's next CFO. They have a strong and stable executive team in place, with an average tenure in MicroStrategy of greater than 13 years and believe adding a dedicated CFO will help us in the pursuit of both of our strategies. I look forward to having more time to focus on my role as President, running the day-to-day business of MicroStrategy, as well as strategically planning for our long-term, helping growth. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for comments on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy as well as market trends for business intelligence software and our executive team. Thank you, Jeremy. I would say it's one major outperformance driver. We had a tough compare going into this quarter. So I think folks thought that our revenues were going to be down a little bit. In fact, our total revenues were up. Our software revenues were up substantially versus 2019. We had good consulting results. So if I was to net it out, revenue growth is good. Software business is going well. There is incremental customer demand for the MicroStrategy platform. And it all creates a good momentum for us as a business. And of course, we've been able to keep our costs an order as much as we can to. So that's what's driving the margin outperformance right now. Yes. So first of all, we're going to continue to grow R&D spend. It's the right place to invest. We'll find synergies and be able to reduce costs in other areas like sales and marketing and G&A, invest that in R&D and grow our margins. If you look at the last year versus this year, we've tripled the amount of money we spent in R&D and cloud. So building out a full multi-tenant containerized cloud platform. We've done that. Now extending that to multi-cloud and extending that to all of our customers is a big focus of ours, and we're seeing good momentum there. Improving or investing more in security. We're the most secure enterprise-grade BI platform in the world. A lot is changing in that area. And so we're going to continue to invest there. We've tripled our investments in security last year. Continue to build out OEM capabilities, so that you can embed our software and any other piece of software and any client application and making sure that our software is open. That's a big area of investment. We've doubled our investment in that area in the last year. And of course, probably the biggest area of investment we continue to work on is making our software intuitive, improving the client user experience. So innovations like Hyperintelligence and more extensions beyond that augmented capabilities. So we're the number one enterprise-grade BI platform in the world, and we expect to continue to do so through R&D investments. And the only thing I might add to that is the stock price, I agree it is what it is, but we offer something that's differentiated and unique. We have a business intelligence company that's growing, that's the best enterprise platform in the world and produces material and growing cash flow, we can invest that in Bitcoin. We can take our Bitcoin strategy and invest additional capital through raising debt, raising equity. And our Bitcoin strategy makes us more known in the marketplace, increases our pipeline grows, our popularity and in turn makes our enterprise software company stronger. So it's a virtuous cycle, and I think that's something that's quite unique compared to just buying spot Bitcoin or investing in a stand-alone software company."

I'll be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2021 Second Quarter Earnings Webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the safe harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Jeremy. I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2021 second quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who is going to provide an update on our operations and finance for the quarter.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Michael. I'll start with some highlights from our second quarter performance. MicroStrategy performed well across the Board, demonstrating continued momentum in our business analytics software business, while also completing another successful capital raise that expanded our digital asset holdings. We built upon our strong first quarter performance and now delivered to the strongest quarters of operational performance in years. We are pleased with the strength and consistency of our execution as we continue to benefit from the numerous product introductions we've made since 2019 and the operational changes we undertook in the first half of 2020. Total revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year or 10% on a constant currency basis and it was up 6% versus Q2 2019, which is our strongest Q2 quarterly performance in six years. Our cloud offerings continue to gain traction for both new and existing customers. While we once again, got some benefit from our favorable comparison against the COVID-19 impacts during Q2 2020, our performance shows clear momentum across our entire business. License revenue grew 50% year-over-year, but more impressively grew 10% versus the second quarter of 2019. Subscription revenue in the quarter was up 29% compared to Q2 2020. Current subscription billings grew 13%, our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Our Q2 subscription billings were impacted by a decrease in short-term deferred subscription revenue as we no longer include contract values that are invoiced in the future. Without this decrease, Q2 subscription billings would have grown 42%.\nMichael Saylor: Thanks, Phong. Well, I'd just like to start by reiterating the company has two strategies. The MicroStrategy software mission is to make every enterprise the more intelligent enterprise via our business intelligence software platform. And our strategy with regard to \u2013 and plan with regard to that is make all of our functionality available on demand via the cloud, make it easier for all of our customers to upgrade to the cloud and then make our business intelligence software faster, better, smarter, stronger. And we were well positioned to do that because that's our singular operational focus. With the exception of just a few people in legal and finance, the entire company is focused upon enterprise business intelligence. That is our MicroStrategy. Where the second strategy, as you know, a MacroStrategy, and our MacroStrategy is to acquire and to hold Bitcoin. Our plan with regard to that, of course, is to continue to acquire Bitcoin, continue to hold Bitcoin. It's a very straightforward strategy. Along the way, we'll be educating the world with regard to the benefits of digital property. We'll advocate Bitcoin and the benefits of the technology to corporations like ourselves to institutional investors will help explain Bitcoin to regulators, to the public, to the media and that will keep us busy, I believe. So MicroStrategy, MacroStrategy. Pursuant to our MacroStrategy, this quarter, we did complete that $500 million senior secured debt offering. That was a big deal. We are very excited about it because it was a seven-year senior note. It's bearing interest at 6% and 18% interest. We thought that was a very favorable interest rate for a very favorable timeframe. We were able to purchase 13,005 Bitcoin using the proceeds of that debt offering and we did that around $37,617 Bitcoin. We thought that was a good price. And the reason that we did that deal was we thought that that was a deal that would be accretive to the other classes of our security holders and it presented itself at that particular time. As Phong noted, in the entire quarter, we were able to acquire more than that \u2013 more than 13,005 Bitcoin. We acquired 13,759 Bitcoin at slightly higher average price, 38,467. We are very comfortable with that acquisition. I was very pleased to see us making such good progress and ending the quarter with 105,085 Bitcoin. At this point, we've now invested $2.741 billion in Bitcoin. For those of you who have followed me that I believe Bitcoin is digital property, and it's the equivalent of digital gold on a big tech network, but \u2013 and calling it digital gold, really understates it, digital property is a bit better. The ability to convey billions of dollars of value at the speed of light and to program it, and the fact that that digital property has an open protocol that any company can write to makes it a very special thing, a very disruptive technology for this decade. We think that acquiring Bitcoin at this time is going to be a wise strategic move. There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin. And we feel like there's a land grab right now to acquire as much as you can because Bitcoin represents a macroeconomic solution to those that want a non-sovereign store of value, but it also represents a technology solution. It's a technical solution to mobile companies, like an Apple or a Google or a Facebook because they could implement digital property right into their mobile apps. PayPal and Square have been extraordinarily successful by doing this. It's also a technical solution to energy companies because if you have a stranded geothermal or stranded renewable, or if you have a nuclear power, or if you have any kind of generator, stranded natural gas or any kind of energy capability, that's running at less than 100% utilization, you can monetize that stranded energy, or you can recycle that wasted energy using Bitcoin mining. So Bitcoin is a compelling technical solution for the energy industry. It's a compelling technical solution for big tech. It's a compelling macroeconomic solution. And because it's so decentralized, you have millions and millions of people thinking about how they can add value to Bitcoin and how they can use Bitcoin to add value to their own businesses. A few general views on the Bitcoin industry right now. The China Exodus dominated the news in Q2. I think the China Exodus was a really good thing for Bitcoin. The result was a decentralization of Bitcoin mining throughout the world. Bitcoin mining is really the Bitcoin security network. So the decentralization of the Bitcoin security network everywhere in the world made Bitcoin more secure and made Bitcoin more decentralized. The China Exodus was also a good thing because it decentralized Bitcoin holdings. And you saw a general shift of the nexus of Bitcoin holdings and Bitcoin mining from the east to the west and diffuse throughout the entire rest of the world. I think that long-term the westernization of Bitcoin is going to be good for Bitcoin. I think it's good for the U.S. dollar. I think it's good for U.S. technology. It's good for western technology. And generally what we're seeing is that Bitcoin is now aligning with the big tech networks from Amazon, from Apple, from Google, from Facebook, right. These are very, very powerful, dominant digital networks, and whereas they have grown to dominance by offering digital music and digital retail and digital books and digital communications. Now we have something new, digital property that is aligning on the Bitcoin network with all of these other western networks. And it's a good thing. Capital is flowing into Bitcoin in the second quarter. We saw this in the form of Bitcoin miners coming public. There are lots of Bitcoin miners that are either public or coming public, and that's going to be our continual trend in the coming six months. And it's an exciting trend because a network of a dozen to two dozen publicly traded companies that are securing the Bitcoin network are going to be beneficial to the asset class. They are bringing financial capital to Bitcoin. They are bringing political capital to Bitcoin. They are bringing technical capital to Bitcoin. They are bringing human capital to Bitcoin, and they are bringing a lot of credibility to the entire digital property network that is Bitcoin. We saw many constructive developments with Bitcoin investors in the second quarter. More large banks in the western world are supporting Bitcoin. Large exchanges are supporting Bitcoin. We see an expansion in the on-ramps. We see more institutional investors supporting Bitcoin, Bitcoin funds. Bitcoin ETFs being applied for more adoption of and more acceptance of Bitcoin through our mainstream finance and also mainstream media.  I think, if we look at Bitcoin adoption at the individual level, probably one of the most exciting pieces of news that I've seen is the result of the crypto.com survey that just came out today. And that showed there to be 114 million individual holders of Bitcoin as of I think the end of June, maybe the end of May, May or June in that range. And we are adding about 2 million more Bitcoin holders per week. So if you think about adding 2 million a week and breaking through 114 million, these are just incredible numbers. I pointed out \u2013 that makes Bitcoin the most widely held financial asset in the world \u2013 in the history of the world, growing at the fastest rate. And that's just an extraordinary thing, right? You can't point to 114 million holders of any stock, any bond, any particular type of instrument in the same way that you see this with Bitcoin. I think that we are going to see this trend continue. And so all of these things are good for Bitcoin. If we add the last observation, which is, I think it's becoming clear that Bitcoin is here to stay based upon mainstream media coverage and more and more regulators are taking an interest in Bitcoin, I interpreted this as a positive, I think. I think there is an enthusiasm and an awareness that we need to support crypto and Bitcoin and the regulatory frameworks throughout the western world. And I think that that's going to drive a lot of constructive activity and constructive dialogue, which is going to institutionalize this asset class even further. And as we make more progress with regard to all of these developments, I think that institutional investors get more comfortable holding Bitcoin and as they get more comfortable holding Bitcoin, I think it's only good for the asset. So with that, I'd like to switch my conversation to software industry trends. The big software industry, the big players in software that we have traditionally competed against, they're starting to shift their focus to creating cloud platform so they can use to offer open cloud services that might compete with AWS and Azure. I think that has reduced their focus upon their business intelligence divisions. I think in general, they're under pressure to grow through the macroeconomic environment, and because the big full-stack software vendors were under that kind of pressure to grow, they'd have to look at making huge investments in new areas that are risky or they have to look at dilutive acquisitions or expensive acquisitions in order to grow their topline. They don't have the strategy we have of holding Bitcoin to cure that on their balance sheet. So because we have Bitcoin, we don't need to engage in a series of acquisitions to keep the topline growing more than 20% or 25% a year. And we can focus upon our core business. And I think that that's really good. It's very important. I think you see that our results and our growth this quarter is because we are focused upon the core business intelligence business and we are able to become a best-of-breed business intelligence company. I'm really excited by our results in Q2. Topline growth 13%, bottom line growth 153%, for our non-GAAP operating income year-over-year 17%, non-GAAP operating margin is very healthy, our subscription revenues up 29%, this is a really strong number. Our non-GAAP EPS $1.72 a share versus analyst estimates that were about $0.98 a share, so substantial beat on the bottom line and that's $1.72 a share versus $0.60 a share last year. So needless to say, we are pleased with the non-GAAP EPS results. As Phong pointed out, it's our best second quarter in six years. During that quarter, the CXO team worked like a well-oiled machine. I don't really think the senior management teams ever worked better. The gears are all humming. We have decided to pursue a CFO search, and we are doing that to allow Phong to focus more on the Presidential role. Obviously, we've got a lot of ambition on our plate. We are excited about continuing to grow the enterprise software business aggressively. We are also very excited about our Bitcoin strategy and by adding this one more role to the management team and allow us to maximize that opportunity. And so with that, I guess I'll go ahead and open up the floor to questions from the analysts and the investors. Jeremy?\nQ - :\nA - Jeremy Price: Thank you, Michael. We're going to jump right into questions. And so the first question is for Phong. First, congratulations on the great quarter. Have you seen any changes in the competitive landscape and what impact do you expect the consolidation of BI and visualization tools will have on your business in the coming years? You are on mute, Phong.\nPhong Le: Sorry. Rookie Move, I was on mute there. Thanks Jeremy. It's a good question. So thanks, we did have a really good quarter, we\u2019re excited about it. And I do think the changes in the competitive landscape are part of what's impacting the quarter. I mentioned a few of them, Mike mentioned a few others, some are the really large legacy BI vendors, SAP's BusinessObjects, IBM's Cognos, Oracle's OBIEE. We all know those companies are really focused on transitioning their own businesses to the cloud, competing with Google and competing with AWS and Azure, and they've de-invested in their BI platforms. So we're seeing an increasing pace of the inquiry and execution and migration off of those legacy BI platforms. And in the case the companies are looking to do that, especially large enterprises were the logical answer because they're looking for a full scale enterprise platform. That's what those Cognos, SAP BusinessObjects are. And so that bodes well for us. The other thing that we're seeing on the lower end is, is some of the newer entrance into BI in the last five years that have very niche solutions, and we're not well-capitalized, starting to get weaker in the last three years and especially with COVID and pressures on capital structure, we saw them get even weaker and either get bought, or start to wither. And in that case, we weren't competing with them directly. But we were competing with their mining share, right? And so with fewer players and with more consolidation, it tends to be a good thing for us. We saw this cycle in 2008 and we came out of that very strong and growing. And I think we're seeing something similar now. So as long as we stay focused on our customer and focus on our product, I think we can continue to grow based on some of those trends that we're seeing. And over the next few years if the trends continue, that\u2019s good for MicroStrategy.\nJeremy Price: Thanks, Phong. All right. The next couple of questions, we'll turn to Michael. The digital asset environment continues to evolve rapidly. So couple of questions. First, wondering if you have a thought about diversifying across other digital assets just as Ethereum instead of staying focused on Bitcoin?\nMichael Saylor: Our strategy is to focus upon Bitcoin. We think the Bitcoin is digital property and digital property in our opinion is the most compelling technical opportunity of the decade. Digital property means that 8 billion people with a mobile phone can carry their property around in a mobile phone. Digital property is a trillion dollar opportunity for Apple, for Google, for Facebook, right, for Amazon. Digital property is the solution to the cybersecurity problem and the trust problem across billions and billions of people. Digital property is going to allow 100 million companies to trade with each other on an open protocol at the speed of light. And so Bitcoin is that is a compelling solution if not the compelling solution. The other crypto assets and digital assets have their own places. After digital property, you've got digital currency, but digital currencies aren't really an investment strategy. They're really just a medium of exchange in the crypto universe. So holding digital currency is just like holding U.S. dollars, it\u2019s not a strategy for investment. Then you have digital platforms like Ethereum and you have digital applications like the decentralized exchange Uniswap something on top of Ethereum. Those are different businesses. But they are in essence businesses that have to compete in a market and you have to consider. The digital currencies are competing against existing currencies. The platforms \u2013 the decentralized platforms are competing against centralized platforms. The decentralized applications are competing against centralized applications. When I look at all those, I think there's competitive risk, there's technical risk, there's regulatory risk. There's a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of moving parts and they're completely different businesses. So just because one is involved in Bitcoin doesn't mean that it makes sense to consider the other crypto assets. So we don't have any intention to get involved with other digital assets or other crypto assets. We're going to stay focused. I guess I'll make one more point here. There are two ways to see the world. If you look at the evolution of the Crypto Economy and if you ask what's the crypto opportunity. One way to see the world is I take Bitcoin, I create digital property and I plug it into Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, I plug it into every insurance offering, I plug it into every mutual fund, into Fidelity, into BlackRock, into PIMCO, I plug it into every product, every device, every service, every operating system, I plug it into iOS and I plug it into Android and I plug it into Windows, I plug it into the Cloud, I plug it into AWS, I plug it into Azure. You see, I can plug the Bitcoin digital property into the entire traditional economy, all of it. And it makes everything better. In theory, if you're a big tech company and you plug into Bitcoin, you could generate a $1 trillion of value just by plugging into Bitcoin. So that vision of the world is Bitcoin fixes everything. Bitcoin is a benefit to every governor, every mayor, every CEO, every product, every service, everything can be improved by building Bitcoin into it, right? That's one view of the world that happens to be our view of the world. By plugging this open protocol, digital property into every corporation, every product, every service, and every government and every agency in the world, you're going to make them better. If you believe that, and you don't own a country, or you don't own a government, you don't own a product, you don't own Apple, you don't own Google, you don't own Facebook, you don't own everything, but you have some assets to buy Bitcoin. You buy Bitcoin so that when Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google build Bitcoin into their product, then you're the beneficiary because you can't afford to buy Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, all of them. That's one view of the world. The other view of the world is, is the innovation is going to come by creating other crypto asset networks, all these other cryptos and by innovating in that decentralized area. We don't happen to believe that, right? Our belief is that the extraordinary value creation activity or opportunity comes simply by plugging Bitcoin into your balance sheet. If the city of New York raises a $1 billion and buys Bitcoin and fixes the balance sheet of the city of New York, and it happens overnight, and it happens not with any more technical innovation, it happens through financial integration. So that's why we pursue this strategy. We pursue. It's a property strategy. If there are compelling platforms and applications in the crypto universe that managed to build on top of Bitcoin, then they will benefit and Bitcoin will benefit. And if there are compelling applications in the traditional CFI world, traditional banks, traditional governments, and then big tech companies, then Bitcoin will still benefit. We don't wish to express a general opinion or take an investment risk with regard to which platform, which application and which use case of Bitcoin will be most successful. We think that the least risky, most diversified investment strategy is to simply hold Bitcoin. And I know that sounds complicated. People think you should diversify to decrease risk. Well, we believe we are diversified because as long as we hold the Bitcoin, any of 100,000 other corporations or 100,000 other technologies that use the Bitcoin will benefit our investment strategy. And so that's why we do what we do.\nJeremy Price: Thanks Mike. And one quick follow-up on that one. Clearly with the financing in Q2, we're exploring the inherent value of Bitcoin on the balance sheet, but this person is wondering if you have any updates on how further to use the balance sheet to drive either core business \u2013 the core business, or help drive the strategy to build our digital asset balance?\nMichael Saylor: Yes. Well, our view with regard to future balance sheet decisions is we'll take into account market considerations and then we'll look for accretive opportunities that are in the interest of our shareholders. And from time-to-time, we'll find those opportunities.\nJeremy Price: Thank you, Michael. And Phong, next question is for you. Why didn't the company issue the 1 billion in equity and buy more Bitcoin?\nPhong Le: Yes. So as I think we're referring to here, we issued \u2013 put-out-of-shelf to be able to issue $1 billion in equity. And we put that out in September 14, which is right the day before quiet period begins, which is September 15. And during that period, until our next open period, we're not able to issue shares in the market.\nJeremy Price: And then one more for you Phong. Subscription revenue growth seems rather modest especially with continued higher mix in SaaS solutions. How do you feel this is trending against your expectations and around the dozen or so new hyper customers that are net new or expansion from current customers?\nPhong Le: Yes. So subscription revenues grew 29% year-over-year, which we were pretty pleased with. I think maybe what you're referring to here is subscription billings, which grew 13%, that\u2019s five straight quarters of double-digit growth, but it is a decline versus previous quarters. The primary reason for that is in Q2, we no longer include contract values that are invoiced in the future where we had done that in the past. If we had done the same thing we had in previous quarters, we would have seen subscription billings growth of 42%. And it's a bit of a toss up there, different ways to do that. We thought this would be more conservative on a go-forward basis. So if you sort of normalize it, the 42% subscription billings growth was quite strong and going forward, I think we'll see that level of subscription billings growth. We still see quite a bit of growth in the cloud business overall.\nJeremy Price: Thank you, Phong. Michael, back to you. Can you walk through some of the factors you consider when determining future debt or equity raises to purchase Bitcoin? And how much room does the business have to raise additional debt or equity to fund Bitcoin purchases? And will MicroStrategy evaluate lending Bitcoin for yield?\nMichael Saylor: We look at a lot of different factors. We look at the market in Bitcoin. We look at the price of Bitcoin. We look at the trading patterns. We look at the history. We look at the outlook. We look at the debt markets. We consider fixed income debt markets and both the liquidity available in those markets and also the outlook for those markets and general interest rates and spreads. We look at the convert markets and the trading and the convert markets and the outlook of those markets. We look at our own equity markets and the general software equity markets and the way that our own stock is traded. And we look at the futures and the options market for our stock. We look at the futures markets and the derivatives markets for Bitcoin. We consider all of the history. We try to compile all of the information at our disposal. We think about the outlook for our core business. We look at the technology trends with regard to Bitcoin and how it's being integrated. We look at the macroeconomic trends. What's going on with the macro economy? What's going on in the general market? We look at institutional adoption of Bitcoin and institutional views. We look at the status of the Bitcoin mining industry, and also the degree of maturity of Bitcoin mining. And as Bitcoin miners come public, they're getting better capitalized. And as billions of dollars flow into the Bitcoin mining network, then that capital is going to change the stock to flow ratio a Bitcoin is also \u2013 every single dollar that a Bitcoin miner raises may in fact be a dollar that flows into huddling Bitcoin. So we try to assess that and the overall regulatory environment, and then the FUD that's in our rear view mirror and the FUD that we may think will be in our forward mirror. And after we consider all of those things, we asked the question, is there an accretive activity that we can take. And sometimes the accretive activity would be to buy stock. In August of last year, we announced that we\u2019re going to buy our stock back to buy Bitcoin. That was a Dutch auction. And sometimes the accretive activity is to convert existing treasury cash. And sometimes the accretive activity is to sell convertible debt. We'd done that twice. Sometimes the accretive activity is to sell senior secured debt. And from time to time, the accretive activity maybe to sell equity, and that really just depends. So those are all \u2013 that's a subset of the factors we consider. So you can be sure that we're thinking about it all the time in order to make sure that we act appropriately.\nJeremy Price: Thank you, Michael. Phong, next question for you. Can you explain the rationale behind creating a separate entity to huddle your Bitcoin?\nPhong Le: Yes. So we created MacroStrategy LLC, and other than it being a cool name and we wanted to make sure we had ownership of that. The primary reason was when we issued our secured notes, it was secured against our BI business. So we did not need to use our 92,079 Bitcoin that we had at that point in time to secure the debt. And so we created a separate entity for those 92,079 Bitcoin as separate to our BI business. So that was the primary reason we set it up.\nJeremy Price: And Mike, looking out over the next one to two years, do you expect institutional adoption to be largely led by founder-led tech savvy companies? Or do you expect companies and other industries with a more diverse set of owners to begin adopting cryptocurrency? And what do you think are the next catalyst to drive that broader adoption?\nMichael Saylor: I see institutional adoption coming from macro hedge funds that actually would have bought gold or whatever invested in hard assets or commodities. Now that a Bitcoin is getting on their radar as digital property and the Apex digital commodity and now they've got like a multi-year track record of Bitcoin outperforming gold. I think that there's a lot of money that's going to flow from gold funds and investment funds into digital gold that is Bitcoin. I think that you're seeing a lot of family offices, high net worth individuals that are private having private money, they're starting to see Bitcoin as an interesting investment because it's a generational wealth preservation strategy. If I'm investing to give money to my grandchildren, then I need a very long duration asset. They're operating out of the public eye, but I hear through my back channels, a lot of that activity going on. I think Goldman Sachs did a survey that was published about a week ago, where they indicated there was a lot of interest in Bitcoin from family offices. I think that in terms of public companies, the public companies that you will see embracing Bitcoin most enthusiastically will certainly be the founder-led technology companies because they have charismatic founders that are risk takers that understand technical nuance. The companies that disrupted digital music, digital video, digital movies, digital books, digital maps, digital retail, they had to think differently. And if you think different, then once you start thinking different about property and it clicks in your mind, a Bitcoin is digital property, then you go from not understanding it to understanding it. And then there's oh crap moment, where you realize that not only do you understand it, but if you don't embrace it and your competitor embraces it, then you're going to be in a massive disadvantage. You wouldn't want to be the last big tech network to integrate digital property into the protocol because Bitcoin turns your billion user digital communications company into a billion customer bank in cyberspace. And so I do think that you will see founder-led tech companies start to embrace Bitcoin. They will do it sooner than other publicly traded companies because they get it and because they need to figure it out for competitive reasons. I mean, the example, right \u2013 the big example right now you can see in front of all of us is Square cash. Square\u2019s had extraordinary success implementing Bitcoin into their mobile application and that is forced to response from PayPal. And I think in time, anybody with a mobile application is going to want to use Bitcoin either to turn themselves into a bank and cyberspace, or there's another aspect of Bitcoin, which is an international digital value network, that allows you to establish trust in cyberspace. So if you are Google or Facebook or Amazon or Apple, and you have people posting online, you've got a cybersecurity issue. The way that you actually can deploy cybersecurity is plug them into a network like Bitcoin that allows for the rapid interchange of value on an open protocol. If you can implement open protocol monitoring network like Bitcoin, then you can use that to fight denial-of-service attacks, DDoS attacks. You can use it to fight and to ameliorate or attenuate spam. You can use it to shutdown hostility and create new degrees of cybersecurity. So I think Bitcoin is really the \u2013 it's the secret to cybersecurity going forward and this is really important issue for all of these technology companies. And it's also a bank in cyberspace. And so it's the future of financial security and the future of cybersecurity. And those companies can't really afford to ignore that, they would ignore that at the wrong peril. I think you\u2019ll see more with regard to that as time goes on. And then I think the last area of adoption with regard to public companies that will be visible. And I think give it six months, you'll see a lot of it. You're just going to see an avalanche of publicly traded Bitcoin miners. Every month or every few weeks, there's a new Bitcoin miner that's announcing that they're coming public. They're either merging with a SPAC, or they're going to do an IPO, or they are public, or they're a public company that's moving from a foreign exchange, like the Toronto Exchange to the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. If you roll the clock back 12 months, it's hard to find any company, any publicly traded company with a $1 million of Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Right now, there's a dozen or more with billions and billions of dollars of Bitcoin on their balance sheet. But what happens when there's two dozen or three dozen companies and they've all got material Bitcoin exposure because they have to, I think that that's going to catalyze a lot of maturity of the asset class.\nJeremy Price: Thanks, Michael. We are out of time, so I'm going to turn it back to you for closing remarks. Michael, closing remarks from you.\nMichael Saylor: Yes. Okay. I want to thank everybody for being with us for our Q2 2021 financial results webinar. We appreciate your support. To all of our shareholders, we couldn't do without you. And I will look forward to speaking with all of you again in three months. So until then take care.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2021 second quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who is going to provide an update on our operations and finance for the quarter. Thanks, Phong. Well, I'd just like to start by reiterating the company has two strategies. The MicroStrategy software mission is to make every enterprise the more intelligent enterprise via our business intelligence software platform. And our strategy with regard to \u2013 and plan with regard to that is make all of our functionality available on demand via the cloud, make it easier for all of our customers to upgrade to the cloud and then make our business intelligence software faster, better, smarter, stronger. And we were well positioned to do that because that's our singular operational focus. With the exception of just a few people in legal and finance, the entire company is focused upon enterprise business intelligence. That is our MicroStrategy. Where the second strategy, as you know, a MacroStrategy, and our MacroStrategy is to acquire and to hold Bitcoin. Our plan with regard to that, of course, is to continue to acquire Bitcoin, continue to hold Bitcoin. It's a very straightforward strategy. Along the way, we'll be educating the world with regard to the benefits of digital property. We'll advocate Bitcoin and the benefits of the technology to corporations like ourselves to institutional investors will help explain Bitcoin to regulators, to the public, to the media and that will keep us busy, I believe. So MicroStrategy, MacroStrategy. Pursuant to our MacroStrategy, this quarter, we did complete that $500 million senior secured debt offering. That was a big deal. We are very excited about it because it was a seven-year senior note. It's bearing interest at 6% and 18% interest. We thought that was a very favorable interest rate for a very favorable timeframe. We were able to purchase 13,005 Bitcoin using the proceeds of that debt offering and we did that around $37,617 Bitcoin. We thought that was a good price. And the reason that we did that deal was we thought that that was a deal that would be accretive to the other classes of our security holders and it presented itself at that particular time. As Phong noted, in the entire quarter, we were able to acquire more than that \u2013 more than 13,005 Bitcoin. We acquired 13,759 Bitcoin at slightly higher average price, 38,467. We are very comfortable with that acquisition. I was very pleased to see us making such good progress and ending the quarter with 105,085 Bitcoin. At this point, we've now invested $2.741 billion in Bitcoin. For those of you who have followed me that I believe Bitcoin is digital property, and it's the equivalent of digital gold on a big tech network, but \u2013 and calling it digital gold, really understates it, digital property is a bit better. The ability to convey billions of dollars of value at the speed of light and to program it, and the fact that that digital property has an open protocol that any company can write to makes it a very special thing, a very disruptive technology for this decade. We think that acquiring Bitcoin at this time is going to be a wise strategic move. There will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin. And we feel like there's a land grab right now to acquire as much as you can because Bitcoin represents a macroeconomic solution to those that want a non-sovereign store of value, but it also represents a technology solution. It's a technical solution to mobile companies, like an Apple or a Google or a Facebook because they could implement digital property right into their mobile apps. PayPal and Square have been extraordinarily successful by doing this. It's also a technical solution to energy companies because if you have a stranded geothermal or stranded renewable, or if you have a nuclear power, or if you have any kind of generator, stranded natural gas or any kind of energy capability, that's running at less than 100% utilization, you can monetize that stranded energy, or you can recycle that wasted energy using Bitcoin mining. So Bitcoin is a compelling technical solution for the energy industry. It's a compelling technical solution for big tech. It's a compelling macroeconomic solution. And because it's so decentralized, you have millions and millions of people thinking about how they can add value to Bitcoin and how they can use Bitcoin to add value to their own businesses. A few general views on the Bitcoin industry right now. The China Exodus dominated the news in Q2. I think the China Exodus was a really good thing for Bitcoin. The result was a decentralization of Bitcoin mining throughout the world. Bitcoin mining is really the Bitcoin security network. So the decentralization of the Bitcoin security network everywhere in the world made Bitcoin more secure and made Bitcoin more decentralized. The China Exodus was also a good thing because it decentralized Bitcoin holdings. And you saw a general shift of the nexus of Bitcoin holdings and Bitcoin mining from the east to the west and diffuse throughout the entire rest of the world. I think that long-term the westernization of Bitcoin is going to be good for Bitcoin. I think it's good for the U.S. dollar. I think it's good for U.S. technology. It's good for western technology. And generally what we're seeing is that Bitcoin is now aligning with the big tech networks from Amazon, from Apple, from Google, from Facebook, right. These are very, very powerful, dominant digital networks, and whereas they have grown to dominance by offering digital music and digital retail and digital books and digital communications. Now we have something new, digital property that is aligning on the Bitcoin network with all of these other western networks. And it's a good thing. Capital is flowing into Bitcoin in the second quarter. We saw this in the form of Bitcoin miners coming public. There are lots of Bitcoin miners that are either public or coming public, and that's going to be our continual trend in the coming six months. And it's an exciting trend because a network of a dozen to two dozen publicly traded companies that are securing the Bitcoin network are going to be beneficial to the asset class. They are bringing financial capital to Bitcoin. They are bringing political capital to Bitcoin. They are bringing technical capital to Bitcoin. They are bringing human capital to Bitcoin, and they are bringing a lot of credibility to the entire digital property network that is Bitcoin. We saw many constructive developments with Bitcoin investors in the second quarter. More large banks in the western world are supporting Bitcoin. Large exchanges are supporting Bitcoin. We see an expansion in the on-ramps. We see more institutional investors supporting Bitcoin, Bitcoin funds. Bitcoin ETFs being applied for more adoption of and more acceptance of Bitcoin through our mainstream finance and also mainstream media.  I think, if we look at Bitcoin adoption at the individual level, probably one of the most exciting pieces of news that I've seen is the result of the crypto.com survey that just came out today. And that showed there to be 114 million individual holders of Bitcoin as of I think the end of June, maybe the end of May, May or June in that range. And we are adding about 2 million more Bitcoin holders per week. So if you think about adding 2 million a week and breaking through 114 million, these are just incredible numbers. I pointed out \u2013 that makes Bitcoin the most widely held financial asset in the world \u2013 in the history of the world, growing at the fastest rate. And that's just an extraordinary thing, right? You can't point to 114 million holders of any stock, any bond, any particular type of instrument in the same way that you see this with Bitcoin. I think that we are going to see this trend continue. And so all of these things are good for Bitcoin. If we add the last observation, which is, I think it's becoming clear that Bitcoin is here to stay based upon mainstream media coverage and more and more regulators are taking an interest in Bitcoin, I interpreted this as a positive, I think. I think there is an enthusiasm and an awareness that we need to support crypto and Bitcoin and the regulatory frameworks throughout the western world. And I think that that's going to drive a lot of constructive activity and constructive dialogue, which is going to institutionalize this asset class even further. And as we make more progress with regard to all of these developments, I think that institutional investors get more comfortable holding Bitcoin and as they get more comfortable holding Bitcoin, I think it's only good for the asset. So with that, I'd like to switch my conversation to software industry trends. The big software industry, the big players in software that we have traditionally competed against, they're starting to shift their focus to creating cloud platform so they can use to offer open cloud services that might compete with AWS and Azure. I think that has reduced their focus upon their business intelligence divisions. I think in general, they're under pressure to grow through the macroeconomic environment, and because the big full-stack software vendors were under that kind of pressure to grow, they'd have to look at making huge investments in new areas that are risky or they have to look at dilutive acquisitions or expensive acquisitions in order to grow their topline. They don't have the strategy we have of holding Bitcoin to cure that on their balance sheet. So because we have Bitcoin, we don't need to engage in a series of acquisitions to keep the topline growing more than 20% or 25% a year. And we can focus upon our core business. And I think that that's really good. It's very important. I think you see that our results and our growth this quarter is because we are focused upon the core business intelligence business and we are able to become a best-of-breed business intelligence company. I'm really excited by our results in Q2. Topline growth 13%, bottom line growth 153%, for our non-GAAP operating income year-over-year 17%, non-GAAP operating margin is very healthy, our subscription revenues up 29%, this is a really strong number. Our non-GAAP EPS $1.72 a share versus analyst estimates that were about $0.98 a share, so substantial beat on the bottom line and that's $1.72 a share versus $0.60 a share last year. So needless to say, we are pleased with the non-GAAP EPS results. As Phong pointed out, it's our best second quarter in six years. During that quarter, the CXO team worked like a well-oiled machine. I don't really think the senior management teams ever worked better. The gears are all humming. We have decided to pursue a CFO search, and we are doing that to allow Phong to focus more on the Presidential role. Obviously, we've got a lot of ambition on our plate. We are excited about continuing to grow the enterprise software business aggressively. We are also very excited about our Bitcoin strategy and by adding this one more role to the management team and allow us to maximize that opportunity. And so with that, I guess I'll go ahead and open up the floor to questions from the analysts and the investors. Jeremy? Our strategy is to focus upon Bitcoin. We think the Bitcoin is digital property and digital property in our opinion is the most compelling technical opportunity of the decade. Digital property means that 8 billion people with a mobile phone can carry their property around in a mobile phone. Digital property is a trillion dollar opportunity for Apple, for Google, for Facebook, right, for Amazon. Digital property is the solution to the cybersecurity problem and the trust problem across billions and billions of people. Digital property is going to allow 100 million companies to trade with each other on an open protocol at the speed of light. And so Bitcoin is that is a compelling solution if not the compelling solution. The other crypto assets and digital assets have their own places. After digital property, you've got digital currency, but digital currencies aren't really an investment strategy. They're really just a medium of exchange in the crypto universe. So holding digital currency is just like holding U.S. dollars, it's not a strategy for investment. Then you have digital platforms like Ethereum and you have digital applications like the decentralized exchange Uniswap something on top of Ethereum. Those are different businesses. But they are in essence businesses that have to compete in a market and you have to consider. The digital currencies are competing against existing currencies. The platforms \u2013 the decentralized platforms are competing against centralized platforms. The decentralized applications are competing against centralized applications. When I look at all those, I think there's competitive risk, there's technical risk, there's regulatory risk. There's a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of moving parts and they're completely different businesses. So just because one is involved in Bitcoin doesn't mean that it makes sense to consider the other crypto assets. So we don't have any intention to get involved with other digital assets or other crypto assets. We're going to stay focused. I guess I'll make one more point here. There are two ways to see the world. If you look at the evolution of the Crypto Economy and if you ask what's the crypto opportunity. One way to see the world is I take Bitcoin, I create digital property and I plug it into Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, I plug it into every insurance offering, I plug it into every mutual fund, into Fidelity, into BlackRock, into PIMCO, I plug it into every product, every device, every service, every operating system, I plug it into iOS and I plug it into Android and I plug it into Windows, I plug it into the Cloud, I plug it into AWS, I plug it into Azure. You see, I can plug the Bitcoin digital property into the entire traditional economy, all of it. And it makes everything better. In theory, if you're a big tech company and you plug into Bitcoin, you could generate a $1 trillion of value just by plugging into Bitcoin. So that vision of the world is Bitcoin fixes everything. Bitcoin is a benefit to every governor, every mayor, every CEO, every product, every service, everything can be improved by building Bitcoin into it, right? That's one view of the world that happens to be our view of the world. By plugging this open protocol, digital property into every corporation, every product, every service, and every government and every agency in the world, you're going to make them better. If you believe that, and you don't own a country, or you don't own a government, you don't own a product, you don't own Apple, you don't own Google, you don't own Facebook, you don't own everything, but you have some assets to buy Bitcoin. You buy Bitcoin so that when Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google build Bitcoin into their product, then you're the beneficiary because you can't afford to buy Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, all of them. That's one view of the world. The other view of the world is, is the innovation is going to come by creating other crypto asset networks, all these other cryptos and by innovating in that decentralized area. We don't happen to believe that, right? Our belief is that the extraordinary value creation activity or opportunity comes simply by plugging Bitcoin into your balance sheet. If the city of New York raises a $1 billion and buys Bitcoin and fixes the balance sheet of the city of New York, and it happens overnight, and it happens not with any more technical innovation, it happens through financial integration. So that's why we pursue this strategy. We pursue. It's a property strategy. If there are compelling platforms and applications in the crypto universe that managed to build on top of Bitcoin, then they will benefit and Bitcoin will benefit. And if there are compelling applications in the traditional CFI world, traditional banks, traditional governments, and then big tech companies, then Bitcoin will still benefit. We don't wish to express a general opinion or take an investment risk with regard to which platform, which application and which use case of Bitcoin will be most successful. We think that the least risky, most diversified investment strategy is to simply hold Bitcoin. And I know that sounds complicated. People think you should diversify to decrease risk. Well, we believe we are diversified because as long as we hold the Bitcoin, any of 100,000 other corporations or 100,000 other technologies that use the Bitcoin will benefit our investment strategy. And so that's why we do what we do. Yes. Well, our view with regard to future balance sheet decisions is we'll take into account market considerations and then we'll look for accretive opportunities that are in the interest of our shareholders. And from time-to-time, we'll find those opportunities. We look at a lot of different factors. We look at the market in Bitcoin. We look at the price of Bitcoin. We look at the trading patterns. We look at the history. We look at the outlook. We look at the debt markets. We consider fixed income debt markets and both the liquidity available in those markets and also the outlook for those markets and general interest rates and spreads. We look at the convert markets and the trading and the convert markets and the outlook of those markets. We look at our own equity markets and the general software equity markets and the way that our own stock is traded. And we look at the futures and the options market for our stock. We look at the futures markets and the derivatives markets for Bitcoin. We consider all of the history. We try to compile all of the information at our disposal. We think about the outlook for our core business. We look at the technology trends with regard to Bitcoin and how it's being integrated. We look at the macroeconomic trends. What's going on with the macro economy? What's going on in the general market? We look at institutional adoption of Bitcoin and institutional views. We look at the status of the Bitcoin mining industry, and also the degree of maturity of Bitcoin mining. And as Bitcoin miners come public, they're getting better capitalized. And as billions of dollars flow into the Bitcoin mining network, then that capital is going to change the stock to flow ratio a Bitcoin is also \u2013 every single dollar that a Bitcoin miner raises may in fact be a dollar that flows into huddling Bitcoin. So we try to assess that and the overall regulatory environment, and then the FUD that's in our rear view mirror and the FUD that we may think will be in our forward mirror. And after we consider all of those things, we asked the question, is there an accretive activity that we can take. And sometimes the accretive activity would be to buy stock. In August of last year, we announced that we're going to buy our stock back to buy Bitcoin. That was a Dutch auction. And sometimes the accretive activity is to convert existing treasury cash. And sometimes the accretive activity is to sell convertible debt. We'd done that twice. Sometimes the accretive activity is to sell senior secured debt. And from time to time, the accretive activity maybe to sell equity, and that really just depends. So those are all \u2013 that's a subset of the factors we consider. So you can be sure that we're thinking about it all the time in order to make sure that we act appropriately. I see institutional adoption coming from macro hedge funds that actually would have bought gold or whatever invested in hard assets or commodities. Now that a Bitcoin is getting on their radar as digital property and the Apex digital commodity and now they've got like a multi-year track record of Bitcoin outperforming gold. I think that there's a lot of money that's going to flow from gold funds and investment funds into digital gold that is Bitcoin. I think that you're seeing a lot of family offices, high net worth individuals that are private having private money, they're starting to see Bitcoin as an interesting investment because it's a generational wealth preservation strategy. If I'm investing to give money to my grandchildren, then I need a very long duration asset. They're operating out of the public eye, but I hear through my back channels, a lot of that activity going on. I think Goldman Sachs did a survey that was published about a week ago, where they indicated there was a lot of interest in Bitcoin from family offices. I think that in terms of public companies, the public companies that you will see embracing Bitcoin most enthusiastically will certainly be the founder-led technology companies because they have charismatic founders that are risk takers that understand technical nuance. The companies that disrupted digital music, digital video, digital movies, digital books, digital maps, digital retail, they had to think differently. And if you think different, then once you start thinking different about property and it clicks in your mind, a Bitcoin is digital property, then you go from not understanding it to understanding it. And then there's oh crap moment, where you realize that not only do you understand it, but if you don't embrace it and your competitor embraces it, then you're going to be in a massive disadvantage. You wouldn't want to be the last big tech network to integrate digital property into the protocol because Bitcoin turns your billion user digital communications company into a billion customer bank in cyberspace. And so I do think that you will see founder-led tech companies start to embrace Bitcoin. They will do it sooner than other publicly traded companies because they get it and because they need to figure it out for competitive reasons. I mean, the example, right \u2013 the big example right now you can see in front of all of us is Square cash. Square's had extraordinary success implementing Bitcoin into their mobile application and that is forced to response from PayPal. And I think in time, anybody with a mobile application is going to want to use Bitcoin either to turn themselves into a bank and cyberspace, or there's another aspect of Bitcoin, which is an international digital value network, that allows you to establish trust in cyberspace. So if you are Google or Facebook or Amazon or Apple, and you have people posting online, you've got a cybersecurity issue. The way that you actually can deploy cybersecurity is plug them into a network like Bitcoin that allows for the rapid interchange of value on an open protocol. If you can implement open protocol monitoring network like Bitcoin, then you can use that to fight denial-of-service attacks, DDoS attacks. You can use it to fight and to ameliorate or attenuate spam. You can use it to shutdown hostility and create new degrees of cybersecurity. So I think Bitcoin is really the \u2013 it's the secret to cybersecurity going forward and this is really important issue for all of these technology companies. And it's also a bank in cyberspace. And so it's the future of financial security and the future of cybersecurity. And those companies can't really afford to ignore that, they would ignore that at the wrong peril. I think you'll see more with regard to that as time goes on. And then I think the last area of adoption with regard to public companies that will be visible. And I think give it six months, you'll see a lot of it. You're just going to see an avalanche of publicly traded Bitcoin miners. Every month or every few weeks, there's a new Bitcoin miner that's announcing that they're coming public. They're either merging with a SPAC, or they're going to do an IPO, or they are public, or they're a public company that's moving from a foreign exchange, like the Toronto Exchange to the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange. If you roll the clock back 12 months, it's hard to find any company, any publicly traded company with a $1 million of Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Right now, there's a dozen or more with billions and billions of dollars of Bitcoin on their balance sheet. But what happens when there's two dozen or three dozen companies and they've all got material Bitcoin exposure because they have to, I think that that's going to catalyze a lot of maturity of the asset class. Yes. Okay. I want to thank everybody for being with us for our Q2 2021 financial results webinar. We appreciate your support. To all of our shareholders, we couldn't do without you. And I will look forward to speaking with all of you again in three months. So until then take care."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. I'll start with some highlights from our second quarter performance. MicroStrategy performed well across the Board, demonstrating continued momentum in our business analytics software business, while also completing another successful capital raise that expanded our digital asset holdings. We built upon our strong first quarter performance and now delivered to the strongest quarters of operational performance in years. We are pleased with the strength and consistency of our execution as we continue to benefit from the numerous product introductions we've made since 2019 and the operational changes we undertook in the first half of 2020. Total revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year or 10% on a constant currency basis and it was up 6% versus Q2 2019, which is our strongest Q2 quarterly performance in six years. Our cloud offerings continue to gain traction for both new and existing customers. While we once again, got some benefit from our favorable comparison against the COVID-19 impacts during Q2 2020, our performance shows clear momentum across our entire business. License revenue grew 50% year-over-year, but more impressively grew 10% versus the second quarter of 2019. Subscription revenue in the quarter was up 29% compared to Q2 2020. Current subscription billings grew 13%, our fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Our Q2 subscription billings were impacted by a decrease in short-term deferred subscription revenue as we no longer include contract values that are invoiced in the future. Without this decrease, Q2 subscription billings would have grown 42%. Sorry. Rookie Move, I was on mute there. Thanks Jeremy. It's a good question. So thanks, we did have a really good quarter, we're excited about it. And I do think the changes in the competitive landscape are part of what's impacting the quarter. I mentioned a few of them, Mike mentioned a few others, some are the really large legacy BI vendors, SAP's BusinessObjects, IBM's Cognos, Oracle's OBIEE. We all know those companies are really focused on transitioning their own businesses to the cloud, competing with Google and competing with AWS and Azure, and they've de-invested in their BI platforms. So we're seeing an increasing pace of the inquiry and execution and migration off of those legacy BI platforms. And in the case the companies are looking to do that, especially large enterprises were the logical answer because they're looking for a full scale enterprise platform. That's what those Cognos, SAP BusinessObjects are. And so that bodes well for us. The other thing that we're seeing on the lower end is, is some of the newer entrance into BI in the last five years that have very niche solutions, and we're not well-capitalized, starting to get weaker in the last three years and especially with COVID and pressures on capital structure, we saw them get even weaker and either get bought, or start to wither. And in that case, we weren't competing with them directly. But we were competing with their mining share, right? And so with fewer players and with more consolidation, it tends to be a good thing for us. We saw this cycle in 2008 and we came out of that very strong and growing. And I think we're seeing something similar now. So as long as we stay focused on our customer and focus on our product, I think we can continue to grow based on some of those trends that we're seeing. And over the next few years if the trends continue, that's good for MicroStrategy. Yes. So as I think we're referring to here, we issued \u2013 put-out-of-shelf to be able to issue $1 billion in equity. And we put that out in September 14, which is right the day before quiet period begins, which is September 15. And during that period, until our next open period, we're not able to issue shares in the market. Yes. So subscription revenues grew 29% year-over-year, which we were pretty pleased with. I think maybe what you're referring to here is subscription billings, which grew 13%, that's five straight quarters of double-digit growth, but it is a decline versus previous quarters. The primary reason for that is in Q2, we no longer include contract values that are invoiced in the future where we had done that in the past. If we had done the same thing we had in previous quarters, we would have seen subscription billings growth of 42%. And it's a bit of a toss up there, different ways to do that. We thought this would be more conservative on a go-forward basis. So if you sort of normalize it, the 42% subscription billings growth was quite strong and going forward, I think we'll see that level of subscription billings growth. We still see quite a bit of growth in the cloud business overall. Yes. So we created MacroStrategy LLC, and other than it being a cool name and we wanted to make sure we had ownership of that. The primary reason was when we issued our secured notes, it was secured against our BI business. So we did not need to use our 92,079 Bitcoin that we had at that point in time to secure the debt. And so we created a separate entity for those 92,079 Bitcoin as separate to our BI business. So that was the primary reason we set it up."

I'm Jeremy Price, MicroStrategy's Senior Vice President of Financial Planning and Analysis and Head of Investor Relations. I'll be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2021 First Quarter Earnings Webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the safe harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at www.MicroStrategy.com. I would like to welcome you all to today's webinar, and let you know that we will be taking questions using the Q&A feature at the bottom of your screen. You can submit questions throughout the webinar, and Michael or Phong will answer them at the end of the session. Please be sure to provide your name and your company's name when submitting your questions. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael Saylor, Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Jeremy. Hi, I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2021 first quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who is going to provide an update on our operations and finance for the quarter.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Michael. I'll start with our first quarter performance. MicroStrategy delivered one of our best quarters in recent history with impressive results across the board as we continue to execute well against each of our strategic priorities. Q1 was our third consecutive strong quarter, which demonstrates that we're seeing real momentum in the enterprise analytics software market and that the product improvements we made over the last five years and operational changes we undertook in the first half of 2020 have fundamentally improved our enterprise analytics software business. Total revenues in the quarter grew 10% or 8% at a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2020, which is our strongest quarterly performance in five years. While we clearly benefited from a favorable comparison due to COVID-19 in Q1 of 2020, we had a strong quarter throughout the software business. Product licenses revenue grew 69% year-over-year, but more impressively it grew 16% versus the first quarter of 2019. Subscription revenues in the quarter were up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Subscription billings grew 19%, our fourth straight quarter of double-digit billings growth. Operating loss was $183.2 million, which includes an impairment charge of $194.1 million related to the accounting treatment of our Bitcoin holdings. Non-GAAP operating income was $18.7 million, an increase of $15.6 million or 514% year-over-year. Overall, we benefited from an attractive sales flywheel that reflects improvement in our marketing and go-to-market efficiency and the product investments we have made to modernize the client experience with solutions like Library, Dossier and HyperIntelligence, as well as further investments in enterprise capabilities like Workstation and our open APIs. We saw a positive impact on our enterprise analytics software business from our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has elevated the overall profile of MicroStrategy and further reinforced our position as a modern forward-leaning company. We are in the early stages of this cycle and are hopeful it will be a sustained benefit for our software business in future periods. Our first quarter results represented a strongest operational performance we've delivered in years. We delivered impressive results across all dimensions of the software business, whether it was products growth, subscription billings growth, consulting revenue growth, renewal rates, non-GAAP operating margin or cash flow. Employee engagement and retention rates also are at their best in years. Our focus is to continue building on the momentum that we recognize that our software business regularly experiences some quarter-to-quarter variability. Looking at our performance in more detail, we had a healthy mix of new customer wins upsells to existing customers and conversions of on-premise deployments to cloud during the quarter, moving more aggressively towards the digital transformation and leveraging cloud technologies for business intelligence, our growing areas of focus and IT investment for certain customers. At the same time, we've benefited from improved demand from on-premise customers, which drove our recent product license revenues performance. There is a sizeable segment of customers who are not in a position to move to the cloud or years away from adoption who need modern open enterprise BI solutions to improve their business performance. While we expect to see our mix of business continue to shift towards the cloud, we believe our ability to add value for customers regardless of how they want to deploy MicroStrategy is a positive. An exciting area for us is our embedded OEM business. This is one of our key focus areas, and we were seeing growing interest from existing OEM customers, as well as new customers looking to leverage the performance and scale of the MicroStrategy platform and their own products. We believe this is a significant growth opportunity for us as software application providers need best-in-class analytics capabilities built natively into their solutions. We're investing resources in this area and are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. HyperIntelligence continues to be an important entr\u00e9e into new customers and as an important indication to customers of our new product innovation. Hyper.Now is our SaaS version of HyperIntelligence and it has seen an increased adoption as well as serving us the foundation of our future enterprise BI SaaS offering. What we believe makes our top-line performance even more impressive is the efficiency with which we're generating this growth. As noted earlier, product license revenues grew 16% since Q1 2019 and subscription revenues have grown 40% over that time, which we've done while reducing sales and marketing expenses by $10.6 million or 22% during that same period. We're very pleased by the continued improvements we're making to our virtual demand generation and customer engagement efforts. Now that we've had success in moving to a fully virtualized go-to-market operation, we're able to seek increasingly creative and proactive approaches and how we leverage the improved flexibility, greater reach and broader market coverage this model allows. MicroStrategy World, which we held virtually in, early February, was the tremendous success. The number of attendees was up nearly 5x to over 12,000 and we were able to deliver 175 hours of live and prerecorded content over the course of a couple of days. One of the greatest benefits of a virtual event is the customers and prospects are not tied to specific times to engage with our content. Many have continued watching videos from the conference after the formal event was completed. Some of the key product enhancements we unveiled during world include Hyper Now, Hyper SDK, HyperVision the MicroStrategy application, new gateways and drivers, and even faster enterprise grade performance. Our ability to generate faster and more iterative product development cycles is allowing us to deliver greater value more quickly than ever before. Our customers are giving us great feedback on our recent innovations, which is an important part of our growth strategy. The most highly anticipated and well attended session in MicroStrategy World was our Bitcoin for Corporations track, which had more than 8,000 attendees and more than 1 million aggregate video views of our content online. As part of this track, we unveiled the Bitcoin for corporations playbook, where we compile the key lessons we've learned as the world's largest public company holder of Bitcoin for any corporation interested in adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet. We believe it is important for us to share what we've learned in the past year, so that it becomes easier for organizations that want to benefit from a digital asset strategy. We continue to have success with our Bitcoin acquisition strategy in the first quarter, an important part of that strategy is acquiring capital we can deploy. To that end during the first quarter, we completed a second convertible notes offering, this time selling $1.05 billion in aggregate principle amount of notes, and even better terms than our first convertible notes offering with a 0% coupon and 50% conversion premium. With this new capital, we acquired an additional 19,452 Bitcoins for $1.026 billion or approximately $52,765 per Bitcoin. Overall in the first quarter we purchased 20,857 Bitcoins for $1.086 billion or $52,087 per Bitcoin, and ended the quarter holding 91,326 Bitcoins at an average price of $24,214. Bitcoin price more than doubled during the first quarter. We estimate that current market value of our Bitcoin holdings now exceeds $5 billion, including $3.1 billion of unrealized gains. We'll continue to deploy additional capital into our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Before going into a detailed review of our financial performance, let me finish by saying how pleased we are by our performance against our key priorities. Operationally, we're realizing the benefits of the investments into the enterprise analytics software business, which is leading to both improved revenue growth, increased customer satisfaction and increased profitability. At the same time, our Bitcoin acquisition strategy has generated substantial value for shareholders and elevated MicroStrategy to a global leader in the Bitcoin market. These successes have allowed us to reinvest in our employees leading to the best employee retention and satisfaction engagement in years, which we're very proud of. We believe our two corporate strategies are proven to be complementary. The increased visibility and thought leadership from our Bitcoin acquisition strategy is driving an increase in inbound software leads. We believe we are in the early stages of these trends and that there continues to be meaningful opportunities for further improvement in each strategic area. Turning to our first quarter 2021 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $122.9 million, up 10% year-over-year, and up 7% from the first quarter of 2019. Product license revenues were $21.3 million in the first quarter of 2021, up 69% year-over-year and up 16% from the first quarter of 2019. Subscription services revenue in the first quarter of 2021 were $10 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. The growth in subscription services revenues reflects the growing portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform. Our current subscription billings were $9.5 million, an increase of 19% from the first quarter of 2020. We're pleased with the performance of our cloud business in the quarter. Product support revenues were $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, a 1% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of customer conversions to subscription or term licenses. Our renewal rates remain strong this quarter and we're executing our strategy to actively migrate customers to annual term licenses. As we continue to execute on this strategy, product support revenues will continue to move to subscription revenues if customers transitioned to the cloud or to product license revenues if the customer converts from an on-premise perpetual to on-premise term license. Finally, other services revenue of $20.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, which largely reflects our consulting services increased 6% year-over-year. Despite the necessity of providing remote delivery of our services to customers due to the pandemic, we were very pleased with the results of our consulting business. Total deferred revenue on March 31, 2021 was $213.5 million. This was up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to a 104% increase in deferred subscription services and 5% increase in deferred product support revenues. Foreign currency translations positively impacted deferred revenue by 2%, particularly in support revenue. As we see more existing customers convert to our managed cloud platform, there's a shift from deferred product support revenues to deferred subscription services revenues. Total GAAP expenses were $306.1 million in the first quarter of 2021, which includes a digital asset impairment charge of $194.1 million. Currently our Bitcoin holdings were considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in their fair value below our book value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges. Total non-GAAP expenses were $104.2 million in the first quarter of 2021, a 4% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year cost decrease is driven by efficiencies and staffing, reductions in corporate travel and a reduction in the number of in-person events, such as MicroStrategy World. Total GAAP operating loss was $183.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 inclusive of an impairment related to Bitcoin of $194.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $7.7 million. Total non-GAAP operating income was $18.7 million in the first quarter of 2021, a $15.6 million increase year-over-year. We're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income of $70 million to $90 million for the full year 2021. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $82.5 million in cash. We issued $1.05 billion in aggregate principle amount of convertible note bearing an interest rate of 0% and a conversion premium of 50% or an initial conversion price of $1,432.46. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately $1.03 billion after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and customary offering expenses. In accordance with the company's corporate strategy of acquiring Bitcoin, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase Bitcoin. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of March 31, 2021 was $1.9 billion, which reflects the $264.8 million cumulative impairment charge. That also is reflected as a loss on our GAAP income statement and the period incurred. We exclude the quarterly impact of Bitcoin impairment charges from our non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted EPS calculations. As mentioned previously, we estimate the current market value of our Bitcoin holdings now exceeds $5 billion, reflecting $3.1 billion of unrealized gains when compared to the carrying value of our Bitcoin in March 31, 2021. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet and pursue our corporate strategy of acquiring and holding Bitcoin. On April 5, 2021, we announced the purchase of an additional 253 Bitcoins for $15.0 million at an average price of approximately $59,339 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. On April 12, 2021, we announced that going forward our non-employee directors will receive all fees for their services on the company's board in Bitcoin instead of cash. An improvement in Bitcoin is a form of compensation for board service; the board decided its commitment to Bitcoin given its ability to serve as a store of value supported by a robust and public open source architecture, untethered to sovereign monetary policy. Going forward you should expect that we'll purchase additional Bitcoin when our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed current working capital requirements. And we may from time to time subject to market conditions issue debt or equity securities and capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin. We view our Bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of Bitcoin and have not hedged or otherwise entered into derivative contracts with respect to our Bitcoin holdings, though we may sell Bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes. We're making significant progress on our two corporate strategies of growing our enterprise software analytics business and acquiring and holding Bitcoin. The continued investment in our technology, our people and our processes has laid the foundation for us to execute on these strategies. We're encouraged by our recent performance over the last three quarters in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic and given that the fact that we are still in the early stages of our cloud transition and our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We're looking forward to continued progress in 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss observations from MicroStrategy World, our Bitcoin acquisition strategy and provide additional feedback on our outlook for 2021.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Phong. I'd like to say a few things about marketing. We, over the last 12 months, have digitally transformed our sales marketing and our services operations. So I'm really pleased that the advances we're making in marketing on our \u2013 our website has grown from being just a small part of our marketing strategy to being the greater part of our marketing strategy. And if you go to the MicroStrategy.com website, you'll see that you can sign up, you can get tech support, you can learn about any one of our products, you can get education, you can learn as an investor anything you need to learn, you can find out about jobs. In essence, the website has become a streaming on demand version of the company's sales force marketing function, and even its executive team. Our website had 281% growth in new accounts created year-over-year, so an extraordinary boost in our engagement with customers and prospects. You all, of course, know we converted MicroStrategy World into an on demand virtual activity. We had 811% growth in attendees to our annual conference because of that. So we were able to dramatically drive up engagement while dramatically raising our costs. We use Twitter more often, both at the corporate level and I as the Chief Executive, I have 775,000 Twitter followers now and that is up by something like 600% or so over the past six months. So we've got dramatic growth there, and we're able to use that in order to deliver messages and information to customers, to prospects and to investors. We're utilizing YouTube a lot more. The corporate MicroStrategy YouTube channel had 1000% growth year-over-year in views, and it's exploded. We did a keynote for MicroStrategy World with myself and Ross Stevens that ended up streaming 500,000 sessions, just that one keynote and to reach 500,000 people with a session, of course, is a game changer for us compared to the way we used to communicate. I engaged in a Bitcoin versus gold debate and we released that on YouTube, that's had 530,000 views in seven days. So we are getting the point now where we're able to reach audiences half a million or more and that has helped us build our corporate brand and it has helped us to build our reach with new constituencies of Bitcoin holders, of investors, of customers, of prospects and would be employees and recruits not to mention their families. So I would summarize that as to say we're utilizing powerful marketing platforms and we're expanding our reach dramatically, and we're doing it in a much more efficient way. And I anticipate that we'll continue with that and we'll build on those successes over the last year going forward in 2021. We have two strategies as you know. We have the enterprise software strategy to sell business intelligence software, that's our core business, and we have the Bitcoin acquisition strategy to acquire and hold Bitcoin. Phong laid out our corporate results for the business intelligence business. I'm incredibly pleased to see that business growing. I think that in the last 12 months, the changes that we made to our marketing strategy and digital transformation of marketing, the digital transformation of our services, of our technical support, of our sales engineering, of our sales programs in general, and of our education all had a very constructive impact on that business. They help us to deliver a better product and to reach more customers and prospects. And so that's been a source of optimism for us and it's very auspicious looking forward. We have moved to streamline and to improve the productivity of our technical offering by emphasizing the cloud, by emphasizing ease of use, by emphasizing speed and performance and simplicity with our Hyper Now offering, our cloud offering and are soon to be Intel Now offering. Those have been well received by our customers and their linchpin for our business intelligence growth strategy moving forward. Switching gears to the Bitcoin strategy. The Bitcoin strategy is working out well. Of course, as Phong has pointed out, we've realized very, very strong capital gains in our investment program. Perhaps more importantly, we've established a balance sheet of approximately $5 billion of assets, primarily Bitcoin assets that give us exposure and give us a great way to protect our shareholders from monetary inflation and actually in fact benefit from monetary inflation. If we roll the clock back a year ago, we had approximately $500 million of cash assets and no expectation of any investment gain from those assets. And today, we have $5 billion in Bitcoin assets and as Bitcoin grows, the company is going to benefit, the shareholders will benefit. Clearly, if you're a MicroStrategy shareholder and you have a negative sentiment on Bitcoin, then we're probably not the right company for you, but if you have a positive sentiment about where Bitcoin is going to head, and then we have aligned our balance sheet and all of our shareholders' interests with that sentiment. The big activity with regard to Bitcoin in the quarter was the convertible debt issuance and Phong laid out the details. I just want to share a few observations. Whenever we think about financing activities, our number one concern is, is this going to be accretive to all of our classes of shareholders and is this going to improve the strength of the capital structure of the corporation over the long-term? So in this particular case, we did this financing at 0% interest. So that clearly is on the surface pretty positive because we certainly expect to get more than 0% appreciation and our use of proceeds. We also did it with a strike price or a conversion price of $1,432 a share. I think that's important because our previous conversion price for the previous convertible debt issuance was about $398 a share and of course the stock was trading substantially less 50%, you know, while we did a 50% premium. So the stock was trading just slightly less than $1,000 a share when we did this deal. That means that it's an accretive transaction for the equity holders, but it's also an accretive transaction for the holders of the first convertible debt issuance. We want to make sure that we're doing a transaction that they would view as being accretive and in their best interest. And so now we actually have equity holders. We have holders of the first $650 million convert struck at 398 that was 75 basis points. We have the holders of the second convert struck at 1,432. As we go forward and we think about Bitcoin acquisition, clearly as we generate cash flows from the core business and excess of our working capital needs, we will convert that into Bitcoin. And of course that's a straightforward accretive transaction for us because we expect Bitcoin to appreciate at a far more rapid rate than the yield we could get on the U.S. dollar. We even expect Bitcoin to appreciate at a rate faster than the likely organic growth rate of our enterprise software business and I think that's an important nuance as well, but perhaps it's equally useful to say that we don't know really see a strong need for cash to grow our enterprise software business. We believe we can grow our enterprise software business based upon our existing working capital balance \u2013 allocated. So cash and excess of that working capital would be a non-performing asset on the balance sheet if we just left it in traditional treasury. So converting it into Bitcoin allows us to increase our exposure to what we think will be the fastest growing asset that we could reasonably hold. As we look forward, Phong pointed out, we've left the door open to issue equity or debt. There are lots of different types of debt or equity we might pursue. We're always considering is it in the best interest and is it accretive to all of our classes of shareholders and is it going to be a stabilizing constructive addition to our balance sheet? There are certainly types of financing we can do that would either create risk if we're marking our position to market against collateral, which is changing every day. That's not something that we're enthusiastic about. If we were to finance a fixed asset of the company at a reasonable interest rate and it wasn't otherwise finance, then we'd probably pursue something like that. From time to time, we'll see different options and we're always looking obviously the state of the bond market, the state of the equity markets, the state of the convert markets and the state of other structured financing markets will determine what we view as being accretive and of course the price of Bitcoin, so we keep all our options open. But I do want everybody that is a shareholder of the company to know that while we could do many things, we will probably reject most things as not being accretive to the interest of all of our classes of security holders. And when we find something that we believe is a good idea, then we'll pursue that. Looking at the outlook of Bitcoin going forward. We think that the last 12 weeks were really good for a Bitcoin and for the adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset throughout the rest of the corporate world. I mean, as, as everyone knows we saw many other U.S. publicly traded companies buy Bitcoin during the quarter. We're starting to see international companies in Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, buying Bitcoin, and putting it on their balance sheets. Of course, many private companies and high net worth offices are putting it on their balance sheet and institutions. I am heartened by the degree of adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury investment option across the general financial landscape. The actions that we're seeing from JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley, the analyst reports from Citigroup all of the Bitcoin ETF sitting for approval before the SEC right now, the success of international Bitcoin ETFs and the engagement of big tech companies like PayPal and Square to integrate with Bitcoin. The rollout of Bitcoin availability of Venmo, these are all auspicious. I thought that the direct offering of Coinbase and the fact that now the largest U.S. exchange for Bitcoin is also a publicly traded company, I thought that was very auspicious for the space. So generally I thought that the first quarter and the last 12 weeks have been just really good ones for Bitcoin. There are lots of concerns about where does Bitcoin sit, vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar and currencies especially over the past six months. I think that that it's becoming emerging and clear that the world is going to settle into billions of mobile wallets. And those mobile wallets are going to hold a selection of digital currencies and a selection of digital assets. And the strongest digital currency is going to be the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is going to drive everything. And the U.S. dollar is spreading to millions \u2013 hundreds of millions and then billions of these mobile wallets. I think the strongest Digital Asset clearly as Bitcoin and what people are beginning to realize is that Bitcoin is going to spread everywhere in the world and the U.S. dollar is going to also spread everywhere in the world on top of the Bitcoin crypto rail. What's good for Bitcoin is good for the U.S. dollar and vice versa. The U.S. dollar is emerging as a medium of exchange and the preferred medium of exchange everywhere in the world, especially in countries with weaker currencies, and Bitcoin is emerging as the preferred open digital monetary network. And the advantage of the Bitcoin network is it thousands, if not tens of thousands of companies all to exchange value with each other to synchronize and to settle across all jurisdictions, across all nations everywhere in the world, across time zones and across applications and they can all build to the same open protocol. So Bitcoin is emerging as the base layer for the 21st century FinTech economy. It's an accelerant to the spread of digital currencies. It's an accelerant to the spread of digital assets, and of course it's an accelerant to the integration of sophisticated FinTech offerings on mobile devices that are currently exploding in popularity as we see with Square, as we see with Venmo, PayPal and the like. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our two strategies of growing our enterprise software business intelligence business, and acquiring and holding a Bitcoin. We're going to do it because they're both working very well over the past 12 months and even more importantly, they're very synergistic with each other. Our employees are happier than ever over the last 12 months. In fact, our annual attrition is down 28%, almost 29% year-over-year. The engagement of the employees, and there moral is up 3% year-over-year, and so we believe that it's been really good for recruiting. It's been really good for employee retention, is very good for employee morale. Our digital transformation of our operations has been very good for engagement and for work-life balance and has allowed us to agilely navigate all of the restrictions and all of the constraints we've needed to deal within last 12 months. Our Bitcoin commitment has elevated our brand dramatically in the world. Everywhere we go, MicroStrategy's name that's been heard of. The Bitcoin community is adding something on the order of 10 million people a month, perhaps even more millions a week. And that means that we will approach more than 250 million people in the Bitcoin community by the end of this year. Our leadership stance with regard to Bitcoin has generated lots of goodwill for us in the Bitcoin community. It's good for our marketing. It's good for our sales. It's opening doors for us. It's generating goodwill in our sales service operations everywhere. Our customers are happier. They like to see that we're taking a leadership role here. And so not only has been beneficial to our employees, but it's been best beneficial with our customers and our partners and we're able to get our message out and be heard more effectively than ever before. So our Bitcoin strategy has made our brand stronger, and it's really a corporate strategy. Over the last 12 months, we've strengthened our balance sheet. We've created an endowment at MicroStrategy that allows us to take the long-view and we've made clear what we stand for and to everyone in the world and every single week there are two to three more million \u2013 3 million people more that care about this thing. So we'll continue to educate the world on Bitcoin or continue to educate corporations and do everything we can to make it easier for other companies, public and private to adopt Bitcoin strategies. We'll continue to acquire Bitcoin by any means that's means that accretive from time-to-time when we have the opportunity, we're going to continue to enhance our core product and market our core product down all of these channels, including Twitter and YouTube and our website. And we're more enthusiastic now than we have been in a long time. 2021 is looking like a really good year, and we've got a really good plan and a really good set of techniques ahead of us that we can rely upon to grow the business and to create shareholder value. So I want to thank everybody for your support. And at this point, I'll go ahead and pass the floor back to Jeremy to take questions.\nA - Jeremy Price: Alright. Thank you, Michael. We're going to jump right in. We've got lots of great questions. And so the first question is going to be for Phong. The comment and question or perpetual license growth was one of the strongest growth rates you've seen in many years. Yes, easy comp, but it was impressive. What is driving this? Was it perpetual versus cloud?\nPhong Le: Yes. So we saw strength in both our perpetual growth and our cloud growth, which we're pretty excited about. As you mentioned, the comp was easy year-over-year we were up 69% in perpetual license revenue, but even compared to Q1 2019 we were up 16%. And on the cloud side, we were up 26% year-over-year and our cloud billing this is up 19% year-over-year. So all those metrics are some of the best that we've seen in history, and I would say we've seen growth on both sides. The reason why we're still seeing growth in perpetual; two drivers, one is our existing customer base is primarily large enterprises and for them moving to cloud will take time. And so we want to be a part of that impetus, but many are still buying on prem and obviously we're not going to turn that down. And the second key factor is we are also actively moving people off of perpetual maintenance, which you see in our product support line and moving them to term licenses, which will show up in product license revenue. So that's another driver or some of that growth that you're seeing. But overall we're very happy with the growth rates in Q1, whether you compare it to 2020, 2019, or in the years, recent years before that.\nJeremy Price: Great. Thank you, Phong. Next question is for Michael. Post the convert, I'm wondering if you could go into more detail on how you might further use the balance sheet to acquire more Bitcoin.\nMichael Saylor: Well, I think so far we've done two financings both of them are unsecured. So that means that we have not pledged any assets on our balance sheet as part of any future financing. So we've got a lot of options as to whether we pursue secured financing and we pursue more unsecured financing or we look to pledge additional collateral either cash or Bitcoin to financing. We don't have any concrete thing to announce at this point and so we're just always evaluating different options. When we have an option that we find to be compelling and accretive, then we'll pursue it and we will make that announcement at the appropriate time.\nJeremy Price: Great. Thank you, Michael. Next question for Phong. Can you give some more color on the license revenue strength and the mix between net new up sell, perhaps by verticals and regions where you see a faster recovery versus areas of weakness?\nPhong Le: Yes. I wouldn't say that there were any particular surprises versus previous trends, right? Like on any particular quarter, we generally average around 20% of our revenues from new customers and 80% of our license revenues from existing customers and that was similar for Q1. Although we're seeing more leads, as we mentioned with net new prospects as they come on, they typically purchases smaller dollar amounts starting upfront and then we'll expand over time. As far as industry breakdowns go similar breakdown as we've seen in the past technology in particular, retail, financial services, federal government sectors, healthcare were all very strong for us in Q1. So I would say we're continuing to play to our strengths and we'll probably continue do that and we will see some expansion over time of prospects especially.\nJeremy Price: Thanks Phong. And maybe a follow-on to that: one question is around what drove the pickup in the large deal activity. And can you talk a little bit about what you're hearing from customers when they're purchasing tensions and how this might translate to growth in license revenue going forward?\nPhong Le: Yes. I'll take the second part first purchase intentions. We are seeing and expanding of investment in enterprise analytics in general, especially the enterprise part of analytics. I think a lot of corporations are realizing how important things like forecasting and scenario analysis and real-time analytics and understanding supply chains, et cetera, all those things became very important last year. And I think what corporations realize as you kept patchwork solutions. You can't put in departmental dashboards in place of enterprise analytics. You can't have ungoverned data. All of the things that we were competing against everyone realizes you need a true enterprise analytics solution for a large corporation to be able to differentiate and to be able to primarily deal with a lot of external changes, which is what whole last year was. So large enterprises I think are coming back to us and we are focused on bringing in large deals and we did well in Q1. The other big piece that I mentioned is our OEM business and that continues to do really well. And generally speaking, when we sell the OEMs to embed our software and theirs, those tend to be larger sized deals also.\nJeremy Price: Okay. Next question, Michael, as we move more towards a digital society and MicroStrategy is firmly placed substantial, suitably to achieve further growth. What are some concerns that keep you up at night from a CEO perspective? And secondly, do you have plans to incorporate blockchain into related technologies within your products and services?\nMichael Saylor: I think it's an exciting time right now, as we see the digital transformation, the society and I think people understand that, that there's a big digital transformation of their P&Ls and their operations, but we've been big advocates and evangelists for the digital transformation of the balance sheet and the conversion of analog assets and conventional treasury assets into digital assets like Bitcoin. What keeps me up? I think the big challenge is to educate the marketplace. There's a lot of education that we need to do, and to that effect we've uploaded all of our playbooks to hope.com. We've got lots of education materials at hope.com. We have a curated the best and the brightest, the books, papers, resources, reports that we can, we make them available and we're continuing to invest in synthesizing better education materials so that other corporations and other investors can rapidly get educated on what is Bitcoin? What is this digital monitoring network? Why is it important? And how can they best craft their Bitcoin strategy?\nJeremy Price: Thank you, Michael. And Phong one for you. Will there be dividend payouts or stock splits now or in the future?\nPhong Le: Maybe. I don't think we really comment on our capital allocation and dividend payouts and stock splits and those kinds of things, but they're all, they're all things that we consider from time-to-time.\nJeremy Price: Thanks. And one, let's say, stay on the topic of accounting. What exactly is the $265 million cumulative impairment charge and what does it consist of?\nPhong Le: Yes. It's a great question. The way the accounting for intangible assets work is we have to assess them every single quarter for impairment charges. And with Bitcoin, we take a look at what is the lowest price of any particular Bitcoin that we carry and we impair it down the lowest price. It's a sort of precedent GAAP accounting. It is a little bit unusual and we take an impairment as a result of that. That's the reason we reconcile to what we call non-GAAP results. Also we should take out that impairment charge and take out share-based compensation and show our results without those charges. And we also share what we \u2013 most of our investors see as our actual market value of Bitcoin, in addition to the book value of Bitcoin.\nJeremy Price: Thanks, Phong. And let's shift back to Michael, and this might be Michael and Phong. Can you share some direct commentary you heard from CEOs and CFOs about how they might incorporate Bitcoin into their broader treasury strategies during your customer event?\nMichael Saylor: I'll start and then Phong can go. I think that I've had a number of conversations with management teams and CEOs, and I think they're very interested in what we did, why we did it, the outlook for Bitcoin and then the legal accounting, regulatory and execution issues. And for large companies, sometimes I speak with them directly and then for smaller companies and for follow-up, we direct them to all the content we've got on the website, and that's been very popular and well received.\nJeremy Price: Phong, any additional comments?\nPhong Le: Yes. Just in general, I mean, you're seeing in the results. We see it in our leads also, there are folks who are just discovering MicroStrategy either through digital channels or through our website, and Michael mentioned the traffic. MicroStrategy world is a big lead generation event for us. So the fact that we have 5X the number of people attend, all those things end-up creating more leads for our software business, which end-up creating overtime more revenue. It also creates an energy; I talked about it a little bit sort of this energy of us being a forward-leaning technology company. There's a lot of positives that come with that in a halo effect into our BI business also. And so that all is very positive. That said a lot of \u2013 a big part of the reason why we're starting to see success as we laid this groundwork over the last five years, right. We rolled out MicroStrategy 2019. In 2019, we upgraded customers aggressively and those customers that upgraded to our latest version of our software are starting to see the value of it and are willing to invest more into the company MicroStrategy. And so things that we've done over the last three, four or five years are starting to see results in positive aspects of that too.\nJeremy Price: Thanks Phong. We have time for one more question, I think so. For Michael and maybe Phong at the end. You mentioned that Bitcoin thought leadership is driving inbound software leads from new customers. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that?\nMichael Saylor: Alright, just for me or for Phong?\nJeremy Price: I think it's a \u2013 it was directed towards you, but I think Phong will have something to say as well.\nMichael Saylor: I just think that the lead flows much higher because people know about us and they're aware of our company, our brand and our products and what we stand for. And because Bitcoin is the most explosive and most exciting idea right now in mainstream investing, that means that our name gets associated with it a lot. Today on CNBC they had their annual draft where they drafted the Top 10 investment ideas for the year, and the number one draft pick was a Bitcoin and the other announcers were kind of irritated. They didn't get the draft Bitcoin. So I think that we benefit by association and it drives other types of lead low to us.\nJeremy Price: Any other thoughts Phong?\nPhong Le: No. I think Michael got that either. I don't have anything to add to it.\nJeremy Price: Okay. Alright. With that, thank you everyone for the thoughtful questions. This concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar. We'll now move on to closing remarks from Michael.\nMichael Saylor: Well I want to thank all of our shareholders. Thanks. Thanks for logging into this call. And thank you for your support. We do appreciate it. I will look forward along with Phong and Jeremy to seeing you in 12 weeks, and until then all the best.",

            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy. Hi, I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2021 first quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who is going to provide an update on our operations and finance for the quarter. Thank you, Phong. I'd like to say a few things about marketing. We, over the last 12 months, have digitally transformed our sales marketing and our services operations. So I'm really pleased that the advances we're making in marketing on our \u2013 our website has grown from being just a small part of our marketing strategy to being the greater part of our marketing strategy.

As we look forward, Phong pointed out, we've left the door open to issue equity or debt. There are lots of different types of debt or equity we might pursue. We're always considering is it in the best interest and is it accretive to all of our classes of shareholders and is it going to be a stabilizing constructive addition to our balance sheet? There are certainly types of financing we can do that would either create risk if we're marking our position to market against collateral, which is changing every day. That's not something that we're enthusiastic about. If we were to finance a fixed asset of the company at a reasonable interest rate and it wasn't otherwise finance, then we'd probably pursue something like that. From time to time, we'll see different options and we're always looking obviously the state of the bond market, the state of the equity markets, the state of the convert markets and the state of other structured financing markets will determine what we view as being accretive and of course the price of Bitcoin, so we keep all our options open. But I do want everybody that is a shareholder of the company to know that while we could do many things, we will probably reject most things as not being accretive to the interest of all of our classes of security holders. And when we find something that we believe is a good idea, then we'll pursue that. Looking at the outlook of Bitcoin going forward. We think that the last 12 weeks were really good for a Bitcoin and for the adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset throughout the rest of the corporate world. I mean, as, as everyone knows we saw many other U.S. publicly traded companies buy Bitcoin during the quarter. We're starting to see international companies in Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, buying Bitcoin, and putting it on their balance sheets. Of course, many private companies and high net worth offices are putting it on their balance sheet and institutions. I am heartened by the degree of adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury investment option across the general financial landscape. The actions that we're seeing from JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley, the analyst reports from Citigroup all of the Bitcoin ETF sitting for approval before the SEC right now, the success of international Bitcoin ETFs and the engagement of big tech companies like PayPal and Square to integrate with Bitcoin. The rollout of Bitcoin availability of Venmo, these are all auspicious. I thought that the direct offering of Coinbase and the fact that now the largest U.S. exchange for Bitcoin is also a publicly traded company, I thought that was very auspicious for the space. So generally I thought that the first quarter and the last 12 weeks have been just really good ones for Bitcoin. There are lots of concerns about where does Bitcoin sit, vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar and currencies especially over the past six months. I think that that it's becoming emerging and clear that the world is going to settle into billions of mobile wallets. And those mobile wallets are going to hold a selection of digital currencies and a selection of digital assets. And the strongest digital currency is going to be the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar is going to drive everything. And the U.S. dollar is spreading to millions \u2013 hundreds of millions and then billions of these mobile wallets. I think the strongest Digital Asset clearly as Bitcoin and what people are beginning to realize is that Bitcoin is going to spread everywhere in the world and the U.S. dollar is going to also spread everywhere in the world on top of the Bitcoin crypto rail. What's good for Bitcoin is good for the U.S. dollar and vice versa. The U.S. dollar is emerging as a medium of exchange and the preferred medium of exchange everywhere in the world, especially in countries with weaker currencies, and Bitcoin is emerging as the preferred open digital monetary network. And the advantage of the Bitcoin network is it thousands, if not tens of thousands of companies all to exchange value with each other to synchronize and to settle across all jurisdictions, across all nations everywhere in the world, across time zones and across applications and they can all build to the same open protocol. So Bitcoin is emerging as the base layer for the 21st century FinTech economy. It's an accelerant to the spread of digital currencies. It's an accelerant to the spread of digital assets, and of course it's an accelerant to the integration of sophisticated FinTech offerings on mobile devices that are currently exploding in popularity as we see with Square, as we see with Venmo, PayPal and the like. As we look forward, we will continue to execute our two strategies of growing our enterprise software business intelligence business, and acquiring and holding a Bitcoin. We're going to do it because they're both working very well over the past 12 months and even more importantly, they're very synergistic with each other. Our employees are happier than ever over the last 12 months. In fact, our annual attrition is down 28%, almost 29% year-over-year. The engagement of the employees, and there moral is up 3% year-over-year, and so we believe that it's been really good for recruiting. It's been really good for employee retention, is very good for employee morale. Our digital transformation of our operations has been very good for engagement and for work-life balance and has allowed us to agilely navigate all of the restrictions and all of the constraints we've needed to deal within last 12 months. Our Bitcoin commitment has elevated our brand dramatically in the world. Everywhere we go, MicroStrategy's name that's been heard of. The Bitcoin community is adding something on the order of 10 million people a month, perhaps even more millions a week. And that means that we will approach more than 250 million people in the Bitcoin community by the end of this year. Our leadership stance with regard to Bitcoin has generated lots of goodwill for us in the Bitcoin community. It's good for our marketing. It's good for our sales. It's opening doors for us. It's generating goodwill in our sales service operations everywhere. Our customers are happier. They like to see that we're taking a leadership role here. And so not only has been beneficial to our employees, but it's been best beneficial with our customers and our partners and we're able to get our message out and be heard more effectively than ever before. So our Bitcoin strategy has made our brand stronger, and it's really a corporate strategy. Over the last 12 months, we've strengthened our balance sheet. We've created an endowment at MicroStrategy that allows us to take the long-view and we've made clear what we stand for and to everyone in the world and every single week there are two to three more million \u2013 3 million people more that care about this thing. So we'll continue to educate the world on Bitcoin or continue to educate corporations and do everything we can to make it easier for other companies, public and private to adopt Bitcoin strategies. We'll continue to acquire Bitcoin by any means that's means that accretive from time-to-time when we have the opportunity, we're going to continue to enhance our core product and market our core product down all of these channels, including Twitter and YouTube and our website. And we're more enthusiastic now than we have been in a long time. 2021 is looking like a really good year, and we've got a really good plan and a really good set of techniques ahead of us that we can rely upon to grow the business and to create shareholder value. So I want to thank everybody for your support. And at this point, I'll go ahead and pass the floor back to Jeremy to take questions. Well, I think so far we've done two financings both of them are unsecured. So that means that we have not pledged any assets on our balance sheet as part of any future financing. So we've got a lot of options as to whether we pursue secured financing and we pursue more unsecured financing or we look to pledge additional collateral either cash or Bitcoin to financing. We don't have any concrete thing to announce at this point and so we're just always evaluating different options. When we have an option that we find to be compelling and accretive, then we'll pursue it and we will make that announcement at the appropriate time. I think it's an exciting time right now, as we see the digital transformation, the society and I think people understand that, that there's a big digital transformation of their P&Ls and their operations, but we've been big advocates and evangelists for the digital transformation of the balance sheet and the conversion of analog assets and conventional treasury assets into digital assets like Bitcoin. What keeps me up? I think the big challenge is to educate the marketplace. There's a lot of education that we need to do, and to that effect we've uploaded all of our playbooks to hope.com. We've got lots of education materials at hope.com. We have a curated the best and the brightest, the books, papers, resources, reports that we can, we make them available and we're continuing to invest in synthesizing better education materials so that other corporations and other investors can rapidly get educated on what is Bitcoin? What is this digital monitoring network? Why is it important? And how can they best craft their Bitcoin strategy? I'll start and then Phong can go. I think that I've had a number of conversations with management teams and CEOs, and I think they're very interested in what we did, why we did it, the outlook for Bitcoin and then the legal accounting, regulatory and execution issues. And for large companies, sometimes I speak with them directly and then for smaller companies and for follow-up, we direct them to all the content we've got on the website, and that's been very popular and well received. Alright, just for me or for Phong? I just think that the lead flows much higher because people know about us and they're aware of our company, our brand and our products and what we stand for. And because Bitcoin is the most explosive and most exciting idea right now in mainstream investing, that means that our name gets associated with it a lot. Today on CNBC they had their annual draft where they drafted the Top 10 investment ideas for the year, and the number one draft pick was a Bitcoin and the other announcers were kind of irritated. They didn't get the draft Bitcoin. So I think that we benefit by association and it drives other types of lead low to us. Well I want to thank all of our shareholders. Thanks. Thanks for logging into this call. And thank you for your support. We do appreciate it. I will look forward along with Phong and Jeremy to seeing you in 12 weeks, and until then all the best."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. I'll start with our first quarter performance. MicroStrategy delivered one of our best quarters in recent history with impressive results across the board as we continue to execute well against each of our strategic priorities. Q1 was our third consecutive strong quarter, which demonstrates that we're seeing real momentum in the enterprise analytics software market and that the product improvements we made over the last five years and operational changes we undertook in the first half of 2020 have fundamentally improved our enterprise analytics software business. Total revenues in the quarter grew 10% or 8% at a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2020, which is our strongest quarterly performance in five years. While we clearly benefited from a favorable comparison due to COVID-19 in Q1 of 2020, we had a strong quarter throughout the software business. Product licenses revenue grew 69% year-over-year, but more impressively it grew 16% versus the first quarter of 2019. Subscription revenues in the quarter were up 26% compared to the first quarter of 2020. Subscription billings grew 19%, our fourth straight quarter of double-digit billings growth. Operating loss was $183.2 million, which includes an impairment charge of $194.1 million related to the accounting treatment of our Bitcoin holdings. Non-GAAP operating income was $18.7 million, an increase of $15.6 million or 514% year-over-year. Overall, we benefited from an attractive sales flywheel that reflects improvement in our marketing and go-to-market efficiency and the product investments we have made to modernize the client experience with solutions like Library, Dossier and HyperIntelligence, as well as further investments in enterprise capabilities like Workstation and our open APIs. We saw a positive impact on our enterprise analytics software business from our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which has elevated the overall profile of MicroStrategy and further reinforced our position as a modern forward-leaning company. We are in the early stages of this cycle and are hopeful it will be a sustained benefit for our software business in future periods. Our first quarter results represented a strongest operational performance we've delivered in years. We delivered impressive results across all dimensions of the software business, whether it was products growth, subscription billings growth, consulting revenue growth, renewal rates, non-GAAP operating margin or cash flow. Employee engagement and retention rates also are at their best in years. Our focus is to continue building on the momentum that we recognize that our software business regularly experiences some quarter-to-quarter variability. Looking at our performance in more detail, we had a healthy mix of new customer wins upsells to existing customers and conversions of on-premise deployments to cloud during the quarter, moving more aggressively towards the digital transformation and leveraging cloud technologies for business intelligence, our growing areas of focus and IT investment for certain customers. At the same time, we've benefited from improved demand from on-premise customers, which drove our recent product license revenues performance. There is a sizeable segment of customers who are not in a position to move to the cloud or years away from adoption who need modern open enterprise BI solutions to improve their business performance. While we expect to see our mix of business continue to shift towards the cloud, we believe our ability to add value for customers regardless of how they want to deploy MicroStrategy is a positive. An exciting area for us is our embedded OEM business. This is one of our key focus areas, and we were seeing growing interest from existing OEM customers, as well as new customers looking to leverage the performance and scale of the MicroStrategy platform and their own products. We believe this is a significant growth opportunity for us as software application providers need best-in-class analytics capabilities built natively into their solutions. We're investing resources in this area and are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. HyperIntelligence continues to be an important entre\u0301e into new customers and as an important indication to customers of our new product innovation. Hyper.Now is our SaaS version of HyperIntelligence and it has seen an increased adoption as well as serving us the foundation of our future enterprise BI SaaS offering. What we believe makes our top-line performance even more impressive is the efficiency with which we're generating this growth. As noted earlier, product license revenues grew 16% since Q1 2019 and subscription revenues have grown 40% over that time, which we've done while reducing sales and marketing expenses by $10.6 million or 22% during that same period. We're very pleased by the continued improvements we're making to our virtual demand generation and customer engagement efforts. Now that we've had success in moving to a fully virtualized go-to-market operation, we're able to seek increasingly creative and proactive approaches and how we leverage the improved flexibility, greater reach and broader market coverage this model allows. MicroStrategy World, which we held virtually in, early February, was the tremendous success. The number of attendees was up nearly 5x to over 12,000 and we were able to deliver 175 hours of live and prerecorded content over the course of a couple of days. One of the greatest benefits of a virtual event is the customers and prospects are not tied to specific times to engage with our content. Many have continued watching videos from the conference after the formal event was completed. Some of the key product enhancements we unveiled during world include Hyper Now, Hyper SDK, HyperVision the MicroStrategy application, new gateways and drivers, and even faster enterprise grade performance. Our ability to generate faster and more iterative product development cycles is allowing us to deliver greater value more quickly than ever before. Our customers are giving us great feedback on our recent innovations, which is an important part of our growth strategy. The most highly anticipated and well attended session in MicroStrategy World was our Bitcoin for Corporations track, which had more than 8,000 attendees and more than 1 million aggregate video views of our content online. As part of this track, we unveiled the Bitcoin for corporations playbook, where we compile the key lessons we've learned as the world's largest public company holder of Bitcoin for any corporation interested in adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet. We believe it is important for us to share what we've learned in the past year, so that it becomes easier for organizations that want to benefit from a digital asset strategy. We continue to have success with our Bitcoin acquisition strategy in the first quarter, an important part of that strategy is acquiring capital we can deploy. To that end during the first quarter, we completed a second convertible notes offering, this time selling $1.05 billion in aggregate principle amount of notes, and even better terms than our first convertible notes offering with a 0% coupon and 50% conversion premium. With this new capital, we acquired an additional 19,452 Bitcoins for $1.026 billion or approximately $52,765 per Bitcoin. Overall in the first quarter we purchased 20,857 Bitcoins for $1.086 billion or $52,087 per Bitcoin, and ended the quarter holding 91,326 Bitcoins at an average price of $24,214. Bitcoin price more than doubled during the first quarter. We estimate that current market value of our Bitcoin holdings now exceeds $5 billion, including $3.1 billion of unrealized gains. We'll continue to deploy additional capital into our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Before going into a detailed review of our financial performance, let me finish by saying how pleased we are by our performance against our key priorities. Operationally, we're realizing the benefits of the investments into the enterprise analytics software business, which is leading to both improved revenue growth, increased customer satisfaction and increased profitability. At the same time, our Bitcoin acquisition strategy has generated substantial value for shareholders and elevated MicroStrategy to a global leader in the Bitcoin market. These successes have allowed us to reinvest in our employees leading to the best employee retention and satisfaction engagement in years, which we're very proud of. We believe our two corporate strategies are proven to be complementary. The increased visibility and thought leadership from our Bitcoin acquisition strategy is driving an increase in inbound software leads. We believe we are in the early stages of these trends and that there continues to be meaningful opportunities for further improvement in each strategic area. Turning to our first quarter 2021 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $122.9 million, up 10% year-over-year, and up 7% from the first quarter of 2019. Product license revenues were $21.3 million in the first quarter of 2021, up 69% year-over-year and up 16% from the first quarter of 2019. Subscription services revenue in the first quarter of 2021 were $10 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year. The growth in subscription services revenues reflects the growing portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform. Our current subscription billings were $9.5 million, an increase of 19% from the first quarter of 2020. We're pleased with the performance of our cloud business in the quarter. Product support revenues were $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, a 1% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of customer conversions to subscription or term licenses. Our renewal rates remain strong this quarter and we're executing our strategy to actively migrate customers to annual term licenses. As we continue to execute on this strategy, product support revenues will continue to move to subscription revenues if customers transitioned to the cloud or to product license revenues if the customer converts from an on-premise perpetual to on-premise term license. Finally, other services revenue of $20.9 million in the first quarter of 2021, which largely reflects our consulting services increased 6% year-over-year. Despite the necessity of providing remote delivery of our services to customers due to the pandemic, we were very pleased with the results of our consulting business. Total deferred revenue on March 31, 2021 was $213.5 million. This was up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to a 104% increase in deferred subscription services and 5% increase in deferred product support revenues. Foreign currency translations positively impacted deferred revenue by 2%, particularly in support revenue. As we see more existing customers convert to our managed cloud platform, there's a shift from deferred product support revenues to deferred subscription services revenues. Total GAAP expenses were $306.1 million in the first quarter of 2021, which includes a digital asset impairment charge of $194.1 million. Currently our Bitcoin holdings were considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in their fair value below our book value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges. Total non-GAAP expenses were $104.2 million in the first quarter of 2021, a 4% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year cost decrease is driven by efficiencies and staffing, reductions in corporate travel and a reduction in the number of in-person events, such as MicroStrategy World. Total GAAP operating loss was $183.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 inclusive of an impairment related to Bitcoin of $194.1 million and stock-based compensation expense of $7.7 million. Total non-GAAP operating income was $18.7 million in the first quarter of 2021, a $15.6 million increase year-over-year. We're pleased with our non-GAAP operating income. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating income of $70 million to $90 million for the full year 2021. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $82.5 million in cash. We issued $1.05 billion in aggregate principle amount of convertible note bearing an interest rate of 0% and a conversion premium of 50% or an initial conversion price of $1,432.46. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately $1.03 billion after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions and customary offering expenses. In accordance with the company's corporate strategy of acquiring Bitcoin, we used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to purchase Bitcoin. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of March 31, 2021 was $1.9 billion, which reflects the $264.8 million cumulative impairment charge. That also is reflected as a loss on our GAAP income statement and the period incurred. We exclude the quarterly impact of Bitcoin impairment charges from our non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP diluted EPS calculations. As mentioned previously, we estimate the current market value of our Bitcoin holdings now exceeds $5 billion, reflecting $3.1 billion of unrealized gains when compared to the carrying value of our Bitcoin in March 31, 2021. We continue to actively manage our balance sheet and pursue our corporate strategy of acquiring and holding Bitcoin. On April 5, 2021, we announced the purchase of an additional 253 Bitcoins for $15.0 million at an average price of approximately $59,339 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. On April 12, 2021, we announced that going forward our non-employee directors will receive all fees for their services on the company's board in Bitcoin instead of cash. An improvement in Bitcoin is a form of compensation for board service; the board decided its commitment to Bitcoin given its ability to serve as a store of value supported by a robust and public open source architecture, untethered to sovereign monetary policy. Going forward you should expect that we'll purchase additional Bitcoin when our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments exceed current working capital requirements. And we may from time to time subject to market conditions issue debt or equity securities and capital raising transactions with the objective of using the proceeds to purchase Bitcoin. We view our Bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not plan to engage in regular trading of Bitcoin and have not hedged or otherwise entered into derivative contracts with respect to our Bitcoin holdings, though we may sell Bitcoin in future periods as needed to generate cash for treasury management and other general corporate purposes. We're making significant progress on our two corporate strategies of growing our enterprise software analytics business and acquiring and holding Bitcoin. The continued investment in our technology, our people and our processes has laid the foundation for us to execute on these strategies. We're encouraged by our recent performance over the last three quarters in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic and given that the fact that we are still in the early stages of our cloud transition and our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We're looking forward to continued progress in 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss observations from MicroStrategy World, our Bitcoin acquisition strategy and provide additional feedback on our outlook for 2021. Yes. So we saw strength in both our perpetual growth and our cloud growth, which we're pretty excited about. As you mentioned, the comp was easy year-over-year we were up 69% in perpetual license revenue, but even compared to Q1 2019 we were up 16%. And on the cloud side, we were up 26% year-over-year and our cloud billing this is up 19% year-over-year. So all those metrics are some of the best that we've seen in history, and I would say we've seen growth on both sides. The reason why we're still seeing growth in perpetual; two drivers, one is our existing customer base is primarily large enterprises and for them moving to cloud will take time. And so we want to be a part of that impetus, but many are still buying on prem and obviously we're not going to turn that down. And the second key factor is we are also actively moving people off of perpetual maintenance, which you see in our product support line and moving them to term licenses, which will show up in product license revenue. So that's another driver or some of that growth that you're seeing. But overall we're very happy with the growth rates in Q1, whether you compare it to 2020, 2019, or in the years, recent years before that. Yes. I wouldn't say that there were any particular surprises versus previous trends, right? Like on any particular quarter, we generally average around 20% of our revenues from new customers and 80% of our license revenues from existing customers and that was similar for Q1. Although we're seeing more leads, as we mentioned with net new prospects as they come on, they typically purchases smaller dollar amounts starting upfront and then we'll expand over time. As far as industry breakdowns go similar breakdown as we've seen in the past technology in particular, retail, financial services, federal government sectors, healthcare were all very strong for us in Q1. So I would say we're continuing to play to our strengths and we'll probably continue do that and we will see some expansion over time of prospects especially. Yes. I'll take the second part first purchase intentions. We are seeing and expanding of investment in enterprise analytics in general, especially the enterprise part of analytics. I think a lot of corporations are realizing how important things like forecasting and scenario analysis and real-time analytics and understanding supply chains, et cetera, all those things became very important last year. And I think what corporations realize as you kept patchwork solutions. You can't put in departmental dashboards in place of enterprise analytics. You can't have ungoverned data. All of the things that we were competing against everyone realizes you need a true enterprise analytics solution for a large corporation to be able to differentiate and to be able to primarily deal with a lot of external changes, which is what whole last year was. So large enterprises I think are coming back to us and we are focused on bringing in large deals and we did well in Q1. The other big piece that I mentioned is our OEM business and that continues to do really well. And generally speaking, when we sell the OEMs to embed our software and theirs, those tend to be larger sized deals also. Maybe. I don't think we really comment on our capital allocation and dividend payouts and stock splits and those kinds of things, but they're all, they're all things that we consider from time-to-time. Yes. It's a great question. The way the accounting for intangible assets work is we have to assess them every single quarter for impairment charges. And with Bitcoin, we take a look at what is the lowest price of any particular Bitcoin that we carry and we impair it down the lowest price. It's a sort of precedent GAAP accounting. It is a little bit unusual and we take an impairment as a result of that. That's the reason we reconcile to what we call non-GAAP results. Also we should take out that impairment charge and take out share-based compensation and show our results without those charges. And we also share what we \u2013 most of our investors see as our actual market value of Bitcoin, in addition to the book value of Bitcoin. Yes. Just in general, I mean, you're seeing in the results. We see it in our leads also, there are folks who are just discovering MicroStrategy either through digital channels or through our website, and Michael mentioned the traffic. MicroStrategy world is a big lead generation event for us. So the fact that we have 5X the number of people attend, all those things end-up creating more leads for our software business, which end-up creating overtime more revenue. It also creates an energy; I talked about it a little bit sort of this energy of us being a forward-leaning technology company. There's a lot of positives that come with that in a halo effect into our BI business also. And so that all is very positive. That said a lot of \u2013 a big part of the reason why we're starting to see success as we laid this groundwork over the last five years, right. We rolled out MicroStrategy 2019. In 2019, we upgraded customers aggressively and those customers that upgraded to our latest version of our software are starting to see the value of it and are willing to invest more into the company MicroStrategy. And so things that we've done over the last three, four or five years are starting to see results in positive aspects of that too. No. I think Michael got that either. I don't have anything to add to it."

I\u2019ll be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at microstrategy.com. I would like to welcome you all to today's webinar and let you know that we will taking questions through the Q&A feature at the bottom of your screen. You can submit questions throughout the webinar, and Michael, Phong or Andrew will answer questions at the end of the session. Please be sure to provide your name and your company's name when submitting your questions. Now I will walk you through the agenda for today's call. First, Phong Le will cover the business results for the full year 2022. Second, Andrew Kang will cover the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022; then Michael Saylor will provide a strategic review and discuss recent bitcoin market enlightening network market updates. And lastly, we will open up to Q&A. With that, I will turn the call over to Phong Le, President and CEO of MicroStrategy.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2022 fourth quarter and full year financial results. I want to start by recapping our strategy and underscoring our key highlights for the full year 2022. We have two corporate strategies, first, an operating strategy and second a balance sheet strategy.  The Business Intelligence operating strategy is how we generate revenues and where most of our operating costs are incurred, and generates our cash flows. MicroStrategy at this point is the largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company in the world. Our goal is to remain a leader in this space by being modern, open and enterprise oriented. Substantially all our employees in the company over 2100 people are focused on our software business.  Our Bitcoin acquisition strategy is a balance sheet strategy. As of today, we're the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. We were the first public company to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin for long term. We purchase Bitcoin using our excess cash, and with the net proceeds of capital raising transactions.  I'll address our Bitcoin acquisition strategy first. In the fourth quarter, we purchased 3,204 bitcoins at an average purchase price of $17,616 per Bitcoin. And we sold 704 Bitcoins for the first time, at an average sale price of approximately $16,786 per Bitcoin, resulting a net increase in our Bitcoin holdings of approximately 2,500 for a net aggregate purchase amount $45 million, or approximately $17,850 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. Andrew will discuss our Bitcoin transactions in the fourth quarter later on this call.  As of December 31 2022, we held a total of 132,500 bitcoins acquired an aggregate cost of $4 billion, or average cost of approximately $30,100 per Bitcoin. We remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy for the long term. In the fourth quarter, the broader crypto and digital assets markets witnessed significant financial distress. In addition, various prominent participants in the digital assets industry filed for bankruptcy, such as FTX, Voyager, Celsius and Genesis. And we do not have direct exposure to any of those companies. In addition, we conducted further diligence of our custodians and execution partners to assess their exposure to these companies and understand that their exposure was minimal.  Since the adoption of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, we've taken a simple approach from day one, which is to buy and hold Bitcoin. We've taken steps along the way to minimize risk, particularly with counterparties. We buy only Bitcoin in U.S. based markets. We custody Bitcoin with institutional grade U.S. based regulated custodians and cold storage, and we have not lended our Bitcoin to third parties for yield or any other purposes. As a result, we've been able to avoid transacting with bad actors in the space.  To summarize our view on Bitcoin. First, we continue to have a high level of conviction in the value proposition of Bitcoin. We're very supportive of the Bitcoin network on a go forward basis. Second, we continue to follow a risk managed approach to executing our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. And third, we're long term focused, we plan to continue to accumulate Bitcoin over time, our core business is not impacted by near term bitcoin price fluctuations.  With that, I will now turn to our software strategy highlights from 2022. We achieve constant currency total revenue growth for 2022 on the strength of our cloud business, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment last year, with high inflation, weakening foreign currencies in the ongoing war in Ukraine.  Total Revenue for 2022 was $499.3 million, which increased 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total software licenses which consists of total product licenses and subscription services revenues in our consolidated statement of operations were $147.2 million, which increased 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.  We've also made important progress in our shift towards our cloud offering, resulting in annual subscription revenues of $60.7 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Annual subscription billings were $77 million growing 39% year-over-year.  The strong growth in our subscription revenue and billings was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud, and new customer wins. Our customer revenue renewal rates continue to be among the highest we've ever experienced. Overall, we continue to see further global adoption of our cloud platform among our international customers.  We're also seeing the benefits of being a single analytics platform in the industry that is both enterprise grade and easy to use. As an enterprise grade platform, we're benefiting from the trend of BI modernization and consolidation from enterprise tools like SAP Business Objects, and IBM Cognos.  As an easy to use platform for govern Ad Hoc Data Discovery, we are the tool of choice for corporations that have outgrown Microsoft Power BI and Salesforce Tableau are no longer want to be locked into a single vendor ecosystem.  On the cost side, we believe in a thoughtful approach to cost management on an ongoing quarterly basis, rather than annual surges in hiring, followed by mass layoffs. We continue to invest in R&D to innovate our product, while being thoughtful about sales and marketing, and general and administrative cost. As a result, we saw relatively flat operating cost from 2021 to 2022.  Next, I would like to discuss our key focus areas for 2023. First, we aim to launch something called MicroStrategy One [ph 0:04:03 part02], which will serve as our core analytics platform designed to meet all of an organization's analytics needs. It will be easy to use powerful, comprehensive and cutting edge. It's intended to be a one stop shop for all of our business intelligence customers and prospects. You should expect to hear more about this from us throughout the first half of 2023, culminating in our MicroStrategy world event on May 1 through fourth in Orlando, Florida.  Core differentiators for MicroStrategy continue to be our enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and cloud offerings. Our focus on these three areas has resulted in more customers choosing to decommission and consolidate legacy platforms in favor of an enterprise wide adoption of MicroStrategy. So this has led to increasing revenue renewal rates every year in the last three years. Our customers depend on these differentiating capabilities to build mission critical applications to run their field forces, store operations, bank branches, risk analysis groups, corporate operations and much more.  As such, it's worthwhile to highlight the resiliency of our business even in the tough macro conditions that existed in 2022. We\u2019re the only remaining publicly traded independent Enterprise BI company, and the stickiness of our products and the long standing tenure of our top customers are testament to our resiliency.  Our continued investment research and development has enabled us to modernize our platform and enable our customers to transform how they do business through innovative analytics tools and techniques. These include personalized applications, immersive interactive, visualizations, simple no code and low code application development with open API's, flexibility of consumption through mobile interfaces, and innovative capabilities like hyper intelligence.  We continue to see growth with customers who build MicroStrategy into the software solutions that they sell to end users, leveraging our open embedded analytics capabilities.  Second, not new, but even more in our focus, is growth. We're going to focus on simplifying our processes growing our pipeline and growing our revenues. We plan to get back in the market and in front of our prospects through in person field events, field marketing, aggressive account based marketing, and a revitalized partner program.  Third, cloud is at front and center, when we talk about focus on growth. As MicroStrategy Cloud continues to be growing part of our business mix, we're seeking to accelerate growth through increased cloud adoption by both new and existing customers. New customers are increasingly cloud first and immediately reap the benefits of our managed service offering. That includes business agility, enterprise security, regular updates and upgrades and cost savings.  At the same time, more and more existing on-premises customers are brought migrating to the cloud and expanding their MicroStrategy usage to new departments and user groups.  Intentional in our approach to cloud is our belief in cloud agility and independence. The power of multi cloud hybrid and the portability between private and public clouds resonates with our customers who do not want to be locked into a single technology stack. We seek to take advantage of the best that each major cloud provider has to offer, optimizing our platform to run on and across each. We'll continue to invest in this area to support our customers need for flexibility, scalability and security.  In Q4, MicroStrategy Cloud for Governments, or MCG is our new cloud offering received authorization to operate under FedRAMP guidelines. MCG is a managed software as a service solution and our first generally available release of our cloud platform that is built on a modern high performance cloud native architecture that also utilizes containers and micro services.  It delivers on sophisticated security and data privacy requirements across the public and private sectors. It opens up the possibility migrating a large part of our business, federal government customers to the cloud.  Our fourth area focus on our employees. Our employees are our key assets. And we will continue to develop and promote people internally and seek to improve employee engagement. Our employee engagement survey results indicate that we have made great improvements to employees, mental wellbeing, loyalty, and belief in the company's two corporate strategies.  We're also continuing to develop technical training and certifications to keep our employees up to date on the latest MicroStrategy software enhancements and soft skills training to keep our managers engaged and employees motivated.  And the last thing is that we'll focus more on innovation, both on business intelligence, as well as on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. On the BI innovation side, MicroStrategy Insights is our first set of products released in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning to augment more traditional reporting capabilities, and provide contextual and immediate insights.  The insights feature accelerates decision making uncovers data patterns with automated alerting, and library applications. The alerts are based on machine learning models working behind the scenes to proactively detect data trends, outliers and anomalies, equipping users with the timely insights to drive action. This is the basis on which we're combining MicroStrategy semantic layer, hyper intelligence and open architecture to provide the data tracking alerts, forecasting recommendations, and ultimately artificial intelligence that will be key for the future of analytics and intelligence.  We believe this is something MicroStrategy is uniquely positioned to provide and we expect to release more functionality in this area every quarter. On the Bitcoin innovation side is indicated on our last earnings call, today I'm delighted to share a preview of MicroStrategy Lightening, our new product that we're developing, which utilizes the lightening network, a second layer network that sits atop to Bitcoin network. We envision MicroStrategy lightening is an enterprise platform designed to leverage the power of the Bitcoin lightening network to enable new ecommerce use cases and tackle modern cybersecurity challenges.  The first component of MicroStrategy lightening platform is lightening rewards, lightening rewards is attended allow any enterprise to reward their employees, customers, partners and prospects for their engagement. Companies spend vast amounts of time and money and digital marketing, driving engagement with their brand and their customers and for some monetizing online contents.  We believe a platform like MicroStrategy lightening can enable them to drive that engagement, rewarding their customers for that engagement directly, rather than lining the pockets of online ad giants. We expect future capabilities the lightening platform will provide opportunities for new business models to monetize online content, or minimize threats and the nuisance of bots and other malicious actors.  While we envision MicroStrategy lightening is independent product offering, it builds on our core strengths and deep experience building highly available, easy to use enterprise software delivered in the cloud. We're taking a very disciplined investment approach such that our lightning development efforts currently occupy less than 1% of our R&D capacity. We\u2019re currently in the initial pilot stage of the product with our early prerelease version rolled out internally to MicroStrategy employees. While our core focus remains on BI innovation. We believe we're uniquely positioned to bring value here. Mike will elaborate further on this topic.  Last but not least, I'm thrilled to share again, that our next MicroStrategy world will be in person from May 1 to fourth in Orlando, Florida. Our customers have expressed willingness and desire to for meaningful rich in person connections alongside virtual meetings. So we're bringing back world \u201823 as a bigger scale event with multiple trucks.  The Business Intelligence track on May 1 through fourth will be a working event designed to help modernize analytics for innovative organizations looking to transform with data. We're excited to showcase some of the world's best brands use modern experiences to break through and achieve extraordinary results.  The Bitcoin track on May 3 through fourth will include our third annual Bitcoin for corporations on May 3, and a dedicated lightening for corporations to and May 4. There'll be a first of its kind gathering of corporations looking to integrate Bitcoin and Lightening as a part of their corporate treasury or product offerings.  The conference will also include dedicated networking opportunities workshops and training. And finally MicroStrategy will be incomplete without an epic party. We're hosting a theme park conference party Universal Studios, Florida featuring roller coasters and an evening of unforgettable fun and excitement. We look forward to your participation at the conference. Registrations are open and additional details can be found on our event website at microstrategy.com/world 23.  Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I'd like to quickly reemphasize MicroStrategy\u2019s revenue priorities. Our three-decade long history of providing data analytics solutions to large and small corporations, has established a long tenured and diverse customer mix, where our platform has proven to be a critical component in running our customers businesses day to day.  Our platform has demonstrated durability through tough economic cycles and has been strategic during times of growth, and important foundation to our revenue it is through supporting our existing customers as their businesses evolve. We continue to deliver for our customers as seen in our consistently high renewal rates. And over 90% for the last five consecutive quarters and as high as 95% in Q4 of last year.  Second, growing cloud revenue, which for us means migrating existing customers into a fully hosted and managed cloud subscription model, which Phong talked about earlier. Winning new logos into the cloud is important and uplifting services for existing cloud customers is also critical.  We are very pleased with our performance in all these areas this past year. But keep in mind as we migrate to the cloud we inherently experienced some offsets in areas like audit license and support revenues. However, the transition to a subscription model will establish high quality annual recurring revenues that will allow us to scale even stronger growth in the future.  And Q4 of last year approximately 64% of our total revenue was recurring, compared to approximately 60% in the same quarter over prior year, a trend that we expect will continue in 2023.  Lastly, our consulting business which has been and continues to be essential in providing expert support and solutions to our customers. They not only champion solutions, but they also drive modernization and also impact growth through partner opportunities.  Okay, turning to the results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $132.6 million, down $2 million, or approximately 1% year-over-year. However, at constant currency Q4 total revenues were up 4% year-over-year, similar to the trend we saw in Q3. Total software license revenues were $45 million, up 1% year-over-year, and up 8% at constant currency.  When we look at product license revenues and subscription service revenues together, year-over-year growth on both a GAAP basis and at constant currency continue to show the overall growth momentum or cloud transition.  Subscription service revenues were $17.5 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year and up 54% at constant currency. While product licensed revenues were $27.6 million for the quarter, down 15% year-over-year and product support revenues were $66.8 million down $2.3 million year-over-year, but up 1% at constant currency.  These trends are consistent with revenue themes that I mentioned earlier. Finally, other services revenues were $28.7 million, a slight 1% decrease year-over-year, but an increase at 5% at constant currency. Our worldwide consulting business which makes up the majority of our other services revenues saw higher bill rates globally in Q4, with particularly strong performance among our European and Argentina consultants. To add to that, we're also seeing early success and momentum in the build out number of India workforce, where we plan to grow strategically in future quarters.  Turning to slide 14, we continue to see growth in our software license and subscription billings driven by the continued strong momentum in cloud. Total current software license billings increased to $61 million in the fourth quarter, which was an increase of 10% year-over-year.  Current subscription billings were $31 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year, our 11 straight quarter of double digit growth. And full year \u201822 annual subscription billings was 39% compared to the prior 12 months, with both subscription service revenue and current deferred subscription revenue growing over 40% each year for the full year 2022 compared to 2021.  We are extremely pleased with cloud growth in 2022, which has exceeded expectations in the timeline for transforming and modernizing our BI platform. 2023, will provide to be a pivotal year as well, as we began to see the benefits of the scaling up of our cloud business and the adoption for our customers in the past two years.  Turning to costs. Total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude share based compensation costs were $309 million in the fourth quarter, or $50 million higher year-over-year. $51 million of the year-over-year increase was attributed to Bitcoin impairment charges in the quarter as a result of the price volatility we saw in Q4.  This was driven largely by the clubs of FTX and its impact to the broader digital asset market. The price of Bitcoin which fell to a low of approximately $15,460 during the quarter, which drove the additional impairment for Bitcoin holdings under the current accounting rules.  Non-GAAP cost of revenues were $26 million in the fourth quarter an increase of $2.5 million or 11% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues non-GAAP cost of revenues increased 2% year-over-year, related in part to the growth of our cloud business similar to what we've seen in recent quarters.  Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense decreased $3 million, or 8% year-over-year to $37 million or as a percentage of total revenues lower by 2% year-over-year. This was due in part to a combination of higher net capitalized commissions this quarter, plus some favorable X FX impacts compared to the same quarter in the prior year.  Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $28 million in Q4, a slight increase of $300,000 compared to the prior year. In this area, we continue to prioritize vendors, as Phong mentioned, and increase their talent and resources on average for the year. But we did so intentionally and in a way that kept expenses flat by leveraging a more cost efficient global delivery centers.  Our non-GAAP G&A costs were $21 million, pretty much flat, the decrease of about $400,000 or 2% year-over-year. As Phong mentioned earlier, our focus on lowering costs has been ongoing and frequent with a strict discipline in managing efficient personnel and non-personnel costs. It's not something that we just started thinking about in the second half of last year. In fact, we were fortunate to add this focus even prior to this past year when we did see higher wages and expenses, revenue headwinds due to weaker foreign currencies and we also saw the negative impacts from the war in Ukraine.  Aside from our Bitcoin impairment related expenses, we kept our costs flat year-over-year. Looking forward, we plan to remain cost conscious while continuing to invest in higher end growth areas like optimizing our talent and resources across our growing global footprint focusing on lower cost markets.  On slide 16, total non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter was $177 million, while the digital asset impairment charge for the quarter was at $198 million. As I have said in past quarters since the adoption of our Bitcoin Strategy in Q3 of 2020, the digital asset impairment charges we have incurred each quarter has always been greater than our non-GAAP operating losses, showing the significant impact it has had on our reported income.  On slide 17, as of December 31 2022, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $1.8 billion, compared to approximately $2.2 billion, based on the price of $16,556 as of the last day of the year. So far this year, Bitcoin prices have rallied significantly, along with the market value of our Bitcoins, increasing to approximately $3.1 billion as a close of markets yesterday, and trending even higher since then.  To touch on the regulatory perspective, we continue to be optimistic with the progress that the Financial Accounting Standards Board has made and its steps update how companies measures certain digital assets, including Bitcoin on balance sheets. Since announcing this as an inject agenda item last year, the FASB has moved expeditiously and voted and agreed on how crypto assets should be presented in financial statements and what disclosures should be required under expected fair value accounting standards.  We recognize that what has been completed thus far are just the initial steps in the standard setting process. But we are encouraged that the progress up till now has been aligned with standard fair value practices. We continue to remain committed and supportive of FASB decisions under focus on improved investor transparency for digital assets.  On slide 18, as of December 31 2022, we held a total 132,500 bitcoins, of which 14,890 bitcoins were held directly by MicroStrategy at the parent, with the remaining 117,610 bitcoins, held at the MicroStrategy subsidiary. Although bitcoins held at the sub approximately 34,600 bitcoins are pledged as collateral to Silvergate loan and just over 82,900 bitcoins or 63% of our total Bitcoin holdings, equivalent to approximately $2 billion at the current approximate market value of $23,800 remain unpledged and unencumbered.  Regarding the Silvergate loan, we remain fully in compliance with the loan to value requirements, and as we have detailed in the past, we continue to have sufficient unencumbered collateral to address any foreseeable volatility in Bitcoin prices in the near term. It is worth highlighting again to that if the Bitcoin prices increase and the loan to value ratio is less than 25%, we're able to release any excess collateral from being pledged to the loan. Our current LTV on this loan is now very close, if not at that level.  As Phong mentioned earlier, for the first time in the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 704 Bitcoins that carried a higher tax cost basis compared to the market price of the Bitcoin at the time we sale. The transactions generated capital losses of approximately $34 million which we expect to carry back against previous capital gains. And to the extent such carry backs are available, we expect to generate a tax benefit.  Even with the aforementioned sale, we increased our net holdings by 2500 bitcoins during the quarter. And we continually explore opportunities to use our bitcoins to generate shareholder value, and we may consider pursuing additional transactions that may take advantage of the volatility in Bitcoin prices, or other market dislocations that are consistent with their long term Bitcoin strategy. We will thoughtfully consider any other opportunities in the future and if we choose to pursue anything, we will carefully assess any potential risks and do so in a prudent manner as we have done in the past.  Turning to slide 19, our debt capital structure remains unchanged with the total $2.4 billion of its outstanding debt and convertible instruments, which carry a blended interest rate of approximately 2.1%. The convertible senior notes carry an extremely low cost of funds with the earliest debt maturity not until March 2025. These convertible notes are very attractive in terms of costs, and with over two years remaining until the earlier of the maturities, not outstanding long term capital remains very valuable.  In Q4, we activated a $500 million at the market or ATM equity offering, an issued an aggregate 218,575,000 [ph 0:01:35 part07] of shares Class A common stock at an average gross price per share of approximately $213.16. We raised approximately $46.6 million in gross proceeds, which leaves us with approximately $453 million of outstanding ATM capacity available under our program.  We will continue to evaluate and sell equity under this existing program, when we believe there's an embedded valuation premium in our stock, compared to the market value of our Bitcoin holdings and our estimated value of our software business. Use of those proceeds will be for general corporate purposes, including for the purchase of Bitcoin, or for other general corporate liquidity needs.  As we execute under the program, we will do so with a discipline focus on growing shareholder value, optimizing our capital structure and maintaining adequate liquidity to run and grow our business. The overall liquidity from both our operating and financing activities remains more than sufficient to manage our ongoing working capital needs grow our business as well as manage our debt expense.  Our outlook for 2023 remains cautious but optimistic. We are planning for the recent trends in macro and market volatility to likely persist in the near term. However, we are encouraged that even in this environment of constant change, businesses need actionable data and analytics to succeed. And open architecture to be agile and cloud capabilities to be cost efficient and effective. MicroStrategy delivers all of these.  In 2023, we will target modest constant currency total revenue growth. We will continue to grow cloud subscription billings as a percentage of total revenue and we will continue to strengthen the quality of our recurring revenue as we continue to transform our platform to the cloud. We will remain disciplined and scrutinized costs on investing in growth areas. And we will continue to execute on our dual strategy of growing our business intelligence and acquiring and holding Bitcoin.  Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Andrew. I'm Michael Sailor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. First, I'd like to provide our performance review. When we think about the corporate strategy and its effectiveness, we go back to the summer of 2020 when we made our major strategic decision, and it was on August 11 of 2020 that we announced to the world that we had acquired $250 million worth of bitcoin, along with a tender offer.  At that -- on the day before our stock was about $121 to $122 a share. Today, the stock closed to $292 a share. So of course, we measure our success based upon the creation of shareholder value. And if we look at the performance of the company stock since August 10 2020 to the close of business 4pm Eastern Time February 1, you can see the MicroStrategy stock is up 117%. We pick a number of different benchmarks. I think the most important benchmark is bitcoins performance. And you can see from this chart that Bitcoin notwithstanding the fact that it is -- it is known by all to be volatile. Everyone that talks about Bitcoin talks about it being volatile, nobody that talks about Bitcoin actually points out that, despite its volatility, it is the number one performing asset over the past 2.5 years. So we can see bitcoin is up 98% versus August 10 2020. And that's just a really critical day. So MicroStrategy stock is levered against the Bitcoin. And so through our execution, we've been able to outperform Bitcoin as an index. So we're pretty pleased with that.  We can trust the performance of Bitcoin to other major asset classes and indexes. And you can see that while bitcoins up 98%. A diversified portfolio of high quality companies, such as the S&P 500 is up 23%, in that same time period. The NASDAQ is up 8% over the course of the 2.5 years.  Gold is a loser, gold has lost 5% since the summer, since August 10 of 2020. Bonds have been even worse performers. So if you'd invested your treasury in long dated bonds, like the BOND and [indiscernible 0:01:41 part08] down 16% in your capital. And although people often talk about gold and silver is money, you can see that silver is even a weaker monetary asset than gold, it's down 19% over that time period.  So benchmarking a digital commodity or in this case, a digital scarcity like Bitcoin versus all of these other asset classes, you can see that Bitcoin has been the strongest performer not by even a small amount by a factor of five to 10x over other options.  We also benchmark ourselves against big tech stocks. And so if we look at big tech, you can see that Google, Apple and Microsoft, which are three effective digital monopolies, and three of the strongest companies in the world, without dispute, they're up respectively 36% 29% and 21%. They've underperformed Bitcoin by a factor of three to four, or three to five, and MicroStrategy of course has outperformed them all substantially.  Now Netflix, Amazon and Meta group, all down minus 25% minus 33% and minus 42%. So this is a sobering observation because most of those names are actually monopolies and they have overwhelming crushing domination. But what this illustrates is that in the summer of 2020, investors were faced with a very, very difficult challenge, because it's just not easy to figure out what to invest in when interest rates went to zero and when we'd already had a substantial bounce in risk assets. And you can see of all these choices, Bitcoin, clearly would have outperformed them all.  We also benchmark ourselves against enterprise software stocks. So Oracle is very well known and it's huge, its up 64%, it's actually done quite well it's done better than all the big tech stocks. It's very conservatively managed industrial software company. But still dramatically underperformed Bitcoin and MicroStrategy as an asset and of course IBM up 11%, Salesforce down 13%, SAP down 24%. People often ask us so why did we do this and are we pleased with the result and of course there are lots of headlines about accounting charges and quarterly losses or GAAP losses but as you can see, if you're a shareholder and your choice was to choose from any of the bars on this screen, MicroStrategy is still the number one choice and Bitcoin is the number two choice of what you want to invest in as commodity bitcoin is the winner as a commodity and asset class and if you want to invest in a security, MicroStrategy has worked very hard to provide shareholder value to our investors.  We have lots of decisions to make as quarters go by. And we always try to evaluate what is the best path forward for our shareholders, what is most accretive for the equity holders of MSTR. And I think that the scorecard illustrates that. To-date so far, we have been effective in that. And we'll continue to focus.  This chart really illustrates why we are so committed to our Bitcoin strategy. And as you can imagine, it also illustrates the benefits to the corporate brand and micro strategy, all of our employees, all of our partners, all of our customers and all of our shareholders of this strategy.  I would like to say a few words about a couple of other areas. Let's start with the macroeconomic situation. 2022 was a brutally difficult year on a macroeconomic basis as short term interest rates went from effectively nothing to 4.5% and that resulted in a drawdown in all financial assets. That was quite painful.  I expect as we go forward, there'll be some normalization in 2023 and 2024. And I think the general macroeconomic environment is rotating to a more beneficial place for us, and generally for the Bitcoin community. We have always focused on Bitcoin rather than crypto. And so if you look at the micro economic situation the past 12 months, most of the crypto enterprises and the crypto assets, and the crypto use cases have melted down in that time period.  Of course, we know the stories of the bankruptcies of BlockFi and Celsius and FTX and Genesis, and Voyager and Alameda. And we also know about the meltdowns of all the crypto tokens, the Luna token, the Terra token, the FTT, token etcetera. In our opinion, these were all very weak use cases, and they were very fragile structures, and it was a matter of time before they do meltdown.  The meltdown of that has created short term negative headwinds for Bitcoin because Bitcoin has cross collateralized with all these other cryptos. But long term, the rationalization of the crypto market will be beneficial for Bitcoin, it has educated an entire generation of investors on the benefits of Bitcoin as a decentralized digital commodity, and the benefits of not having counterparty risk.  It's made, I think, pretty clear what the difference between an asset with an issuer versus an asset without an issuer. And it's also illustrated the benefits of being able to solve custody and the risks of being dependent upon another custodian. The reason that MicroStrategy was able to get through this entire crypto winner is because we weren't exposed directly to any cryptos. Nor did we do business with any of the crypto exchanges and we didn't do it for very clear reasons, because we don't believe in the value proposition of unregistered securities.  And we felt that at some point, eventually, the combination of risky behavior in the crypto industry and the ethical and the legal overhang of the unregistered securities would eventually create a liability.  I think as we go forward, you're going to see much stronger institutions that will be entering the space and they're going to be entering because the industry has rationalized. So the future is fewer assets, fewer -- better institutions, less of the crypto risk taking. And if there is any other result of the crypto winner is, so we can see that everywhere in the world regulators and the general public are enthusiastic about the promise of digital assets. They're hungry for a clear digital asset framework. I think that there'll be more focus on creating a constructive framework and I think people understand better. Why you can't create a digital asset framework based upon unregistered securities without proper disclosure.  We've said before, the only real safe haven for an institutional investor is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the only universally acknowledged digital commodity. And so if you're an investor, Bitcoin is your safe haven in this regard, the others are all question marks, they're all generally unregistered securities and they operate in a regulatory gray zone.  I expect that we will make progress with regard to regulatory developments that will be constructive for the industry. It's not going as fast as we would like. The consistent denial of Bitcoin spot ETFs has been a disappointment. The lack of a clear digital assets framework from coming from regulators or legislators is a disappointment. But having said that, it's pretty clear that that will arrive in time and we do see signs of optimism here auspicious developments. All the FASB initiatives to introduce fair value accounting for Bitcoin is very auspicious development.  The bipartisan support for Bitcoin and for digital assets in general in Congress is an auspicious development. The acknowledgement by all major public figures to Bitcoin is a digital commodity worthy of attention is an auspicious development. And the fact that Bitcoin has managed to survive the meltdown of most of the crypto banks and crypto lenders and most of the crypto exchanges and most of the other crypto assets is a very auspicious development.  So I think 2022 prove the resilience of Bitcoin and then also prove the resilience of MicroStrategy\u2019s business model. And now we look excitedly forward to 2023 and 2024, where we think most of the poor behaviors or the irresponsible behaviors have been squeezed out of the system. And most of the inappropriate leverage has been squeezed out of the system.  And I don't think that people in the crypto market will, I don't think they'll engage in the same behaviors that they got away with in the previous few years, because I think the public has been educated. And I think generally, we have a much more sophisticated set of investors and actors in the space, all of which I think is good for Bitcoin.  The last point I'll make on Lightening, Lightening is really spreading rapidly. And it's being adopted by many, many, many businesses. We see dozens and dozens of lightening startups being launched, lots of lightening wallets. We see some exciting applications of lightening. And I think that's only going to continue -- lightening liquidity continues to increase. We as a company have been very pleased with the early results of our lightening R&D effort and MicroStrategy lightening product development. It's quite impressive what you can do with lightening.  I think. Traditionally, the primary criticism of Bitcoin was the slow transaction rate on the base chain made it difficult for people to see how billions of individuals would onboard to the network and how billions of transactions could take place. But now I think as lightening has spread, it's becoming fairly straightforward and quite easy to see how that's going to happen. We're going to see first dozens and then hundreds and then 1000s of layer three applications to move Bitcoin within a custodial network like cash app, or like a coin base, or a binance. And then we're going to see, all of those applications start to knit together with a layer two protocol, which we call lightening.  And as they adopt lightening as their Layer 2 protocol, we'll see, there'll be massive transaction throughput on the Layer 3, and then we will see people depositing and withdrawing satoshis, on layer 2s, and then we'll see the layer 1 will evolve to become the settlement network of the entire global digital monetary system.  And that's why we decided to host a lightening for corporations track at MicroStrategy world coming up in May. This will be a first, to my knowledge. No one's actually hosted a lightening for corporations conference. But we think that 2023 is the right time, it's become increasingly clear that you can build Bitcoin and Satoshis and micro transactions into your products and into your services using the lightening protocol. And I think that there'll be a whole set of breakthrough applications and breakthrough products using lightening. So 2023 is an exciting year and I think we're moving into the most exciting phase of Bitcoin development ever.  Bitcoin is emerging as the grown up institutional asset in the digital ecosystem. And lightening is emerging as the universal language for moving money over IP.  And so with that, I'd like to go and pass the floor back to Shirish to open us up to questions and answers.\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Great. Thank you, Michael. So we are going to jump right into the questions. And the first question is for Phong. Phong, could you could you update us on the progress of your cloud product and capabilities? And how customer migrations are faring today? And what are your expectations for cloud business growth, given the different macro?\nPhong Le: Thanks, Shirish. Cloud growth is going very well, in 2022, grew on a revenue basis 46% constant currency and on billions basis up 39%, which both represent a bit of an acceleration in 2022. I think we'll be able to see that same pace of growth or something a little faster will be our goal in 2023. I don't think the macroeconomic headwinds will slow or cloud growth. If anything, we might see a slowness of cloud growth because we're getting into bigger and bigger customers.  Now, we've moved at this point, about 20% of our recurring revenue is in the cloud. So we moved to a good amount of sort of medium sized customers. But that's where MCG MicroStrategy Cloud for Government or a FedRAMP offering is going to help us. There's quite a bit of federal customers, large banks that require some sort of a FedRAMP certification, those will take longer to migrate. But I think that's really this sort of next passion that we'll go after. But I'm pretty excited about where cloud growth is going. And obviously, is getting to be more and more the standard sort of way we sell our software.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Phong. Next question is for Andrew. Can you please provide more detail about your sale of Bitcoin in December? And do you intend to make any further sales?\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Shirish for the question. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we sold 704 Bitcoin in December, which generated a capital loss, which we expect to carry back against the capital gain from 2019, which was through an old domain name sale. Apart from that sale, we have not sold any other Bitcoin. And, in fact, I think the main takeaway should be that we have continued to increase our total Bitcoin holdings each quarter since inception, including Q4.  And I mentioned this before as well. But, we don't really stop exploring opportunities and thinking of ways to increase shareholder value related to our Bitcoin. And in the future, we may consider doing other things that may take advantage of market volatility or be opportunistic in the market I guess either way anything we do, we'll do it consistently, within the construct of our long term Bitcoin strategy, which is to buy hold and grow.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. Next question is for Michael. In light of the recent crypto market events, what do you think, are the key catalysts for more adoption of Bitcoin by corporations?\nAndrew Kang: I think fair value accounting is going to be a big plus for corporate adoption. Since clearly, the gap volatility created by indefinite intangible accounting is a negative for CFOs. I think the rollout of lightening for corporations are going to be another big catalyst because the ability to build Bitcoin and play to earn or a Bitcoin rewards or Bitcoin into marketing programs, and to do micro transactions is going to be viewed as a real exciting benefit, it could be a great solution for Chief Marketing Officers, or CHR, or CEOs or heads of sales.  I think that the overtime one big driver is payment networks are inefficient, and slow and expensive. So as companies figure out how to monetize their applications and move small micro transactions around friction free at zero cost, I think that there's going to be an interesting use case for heads of sales and CEOs.  So in short, maybe the last thing is any regulatory clarity that comes from Washington DC, with regard to the digital assets, ecosystem, will be a big driver. And so I think we're all eagerly awaiting some sort of digital assets framework. Bitcoin is, is right now, as I said, the only universally acknowledged digital commodity. And so in a way, it's the one thing you can deal with in the absence of asset framework. But I also think Bitcoin will probably be the biggest winner if there is a digital assets framework, because it'll just accelerate institutional adoption, both on the investor side and the corporate side. So I would look to those three drivers.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Michael. Next question is for Phong. With respect to the competition and demand. So there are two parts? Have you seen any changes in the competitive environment, as customers look to bring down the cash burn? And what is the impact of macro on demand with respect to sales cycles and cloud migration?\nPhong Le: Yes, the first item, I think the biggest trend we're seeing as customers try to bring down their software costs is consolidation of vendors. And in the BI world, it's really two credible choices for consolidation right now. It's MicroStrategy, if you want a full enterprise solution, it's Power BI, if you want a point, solution that integrates well with the rest of the Microsoft ecosystem.  I think what we've seen in the last six to 12 months is that as more companies are trying to use Microsoft, whether it be Azure, Power BI or otherwise, they're realizing the limitations, there's not a common semantic model, there aren't reusable objects. It's not scalable, it's not as secure. And I think customers are also realizing that free Power BI with your office 365 Enterprise license just means you're going to pay more than Azure cost. And it's a well-worn model where you give certain things away for free to drive more usage costs.  And so we see a lot of customers consolidating on MicroStrategy. And so even though there may be a reduction in overall spend, we get more of the pie. And I'm excited about that. As far as the macro environment, Q4 was more difficult, especially internationally as because customers are trying to spend a little bit less. With that said, we still had a reasonable outcome in terms of our Q4 financials driven by our move to cloud. And I do think 2023 is looking a little bit brighter in terms of companies needing to spend to improve their data and analytics environment. So I'm optimistic about the growth potential in 2023.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Phong. Next question is for Andrew. Can you please provide your thought process on how do you plan to address the 2025 loan maturities coming up?\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Shirish. So there has been some volatility in our bond prices recently. And just looking back to Q4, we've seen that pretty clearly. But we've also seen that same volatility pretty dramatically rebound prices here in January in a very short period of time. I think with that kind of backdrop, and changes in the market, we are comfortable with our outstanding debt levels. And we're confident than that when it does come due, we will be able to either refinance it, advertise it or pay it off. And we have a lot of different options available to us to manage those maturities. And the fact is, we still have a lot of time left to do so in the next two plus years.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. We'll take this one last question for Phong. What is your margin outlook for 2023? And how are you thinking about balancing revenue growth versus margin preservation?\nPhong Le: Like that both are like, we're going to focus on driving revenue growth and profitability or margin growth in 2023. I think big driver, that's our acceleration of conversions to cloud, which allows us to see an uplift and cloud revenue and overall revenue from hosting term licenses and support fees.  And a cost side Andrew mentioned it but we were we kept our costs relatively flat, our operating costs relatively flat from 2021 to 2022. The goal would be to do something similar or even reduce our costs a little bit. If you exclude the impact of the coin holdings. I'm talking about non-GAAP costs here. So if we can grow revenues and keep flat or reduce our costs in 2023, then we should be able to grow margins. And I think if the macroeconomic environment improves faster, we can do that even faster in 2023.\nShirish Jajodia: Great, thanks, Phong. I think that brings us to the end of the time for today's webinar. Thank you everyone for the questions. This concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar and I will now hand over the call to Phong for closing remarks.\nPhong Le: Thanks, Shirish. I want to thank everyone for being with us today. And we appreciate all of your support. We're enthusiastic as ever on both of our strategies, our enterprise software strategy and our Bitcoin strategy. I wish you all a good quarter, and happy Spring and looking forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks. Thanks/",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. I'm Michael Sailor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. First, I'd like to provide our performance review. When we think about the corporate strategy and its effectiveness, we go back to the summer of 2020 when we made our major strategic decision, and it was on August 11 of 2020 that we announced to the world that we had acquired $250 million worth of bitcoin, along with a tender offer.  At that -- on the day before our stock was about $121 to $122 a share. Today, the stock closed to $292 a share. So of course, we measure our success based upon the creation of shareholder value. And if we look at the performance of the company stock since August 10 2020 to the close of business 4pm Eastern Time February 1, you can see the MicroStrategy stock is up 117%. We pick a number of different benchmarks. I think the most important benchmark is bitcoins performance. And you can see from this chart that Bitcoin notwithstanding the fact that it is -- it is known by all to be volatile. Everyone that talks about Bitcoin talks about it being volatile, nobody that talks about Bitcoin actually points out that, despite its volatility, it is the number one performing asset over the past 2.5 years. So we can see bitcoin is up 98% versus August 10 2020. And that's just a really critical day. So MicroStrategy stock is levered against the Bitcoin. And so through our execution, we've been able to outperform Bitcoin as an index. So we're pretty pleased with that.  We can trust the performance of Bitcoin to other major asset classes and indexes. And you can see that while bitcoins up 98%. A diversified portfolio of high quality companies, such as the S&P 500 is up 23%, in that same time period. The NASDAQ is up 8% over the course of the 2.5 years.  Gold is a loser, gold has lost 5% since the summer, since August 10 of 2020. Bonds have been even worse performers. So if you'd invested your treasury in long dated bonds, like the BOND and [indiscernible 0:01:41 part08] down 16% in your capital. And although people often talk about gold and silver is money, you can see that silver is even a weaker monetary asset than gold, it's down 19% over that time period.  So benchmarking a digital commodity or in this case, a digital scarcity like Bitcoin versus all of these other asset classes, you can see that Bitcoin has been the strongest performer not by even a small amount by a factor of five to 10x over other options.  We also benchmark ourselves against big tech stocks. And so if we look at big tech, you can see that Google, Apple and Microsoft, which are three effective digital monopolies, and three of the strongest companies in the world, without dispute, they're up respectively 36% 29% and 21%. They've underperformed Bitcoin by a factor of three to four, or three to five, and MicroStrategy of course has outperformed them all substantially.  Now Netflix, Amazon and Meta group, all down minus 25% minus 33% and minus 42%. So this is a sobering observation because most of those names are actually monopolies and they have overwhelming crushing domination. But what this illustrates is that in the summer of 2020, investors were faced with a very, very difficult challenge, because it's just not easy to figure out what to invest in when interest rates went to zero and when we'd already had a substantial bounce in risk assets. And you can see of all these choices, Bitcoin, clearly would have outperformed them all.  We also benchmark ourselves against enterprise software stocks. So Oracle is very well known and it's huge, its up 64%, it's actually done quite well it's done better than all the big tech stocks. It's very conservatively managed industrial software company. But still dramatically underperformed Bitcoin and MicroStrategy as an asset and of course IBM up 11%, Salesforce down 13%, SAP down 24%. People often ask us so why did we do this and are we pleased with the result and of course there are lots of headlines about accounting charges and quarterly losses or GAAP losses but as you can see, if you're a shareholder and your choice was to choose from any of the bars on this screen, MicroStrategy is still the number one choice and Bitcoin is the number two choice of what you want to invest in as commodity bitcoin is the winner as a commodity and asset class and if you want to invest in a security, MicroStrategy has worked very hard to provide shareholder value to our investors.  We have lots of decisions to make as quarters go by. And we always try to evaluate what is the best path forward for our shareholders, what is most accretive for the equity holders of MSTR. And I think that the scorecard illustrates that. To-date so far, we have been effective in that. And we'll continue to focus.  This chart really illustrates why we are so committed to our Bitcoin strategy. And as you can imagine, it also illustrates the benefits to the corporate brand and micro strategy, all of our employees, all of our partners, all of our customers and all of our shareholders of this strategy.  I would like to say a few words about a couple of other areas. Let's start with the macroeconomic situation. 2022 was a brutally difficult year on a macroeconomic basis as short term interest rates went from effectively nothing to 4.5% and that resulted in a drawdown in all financial assets. That was quite painful.  I expect as we go forward, there'll be some normalization in 2023 and 2024. And I think the general macroeconomic environment is rotating to a more beneficial place for us, and generally for the Bitcoin community. We have always focused on Bitcoin rather than crypto. And so if you look at the micro economic situation the past 12 months, most of the crypto enterprises and the crypto assets, and the crypto use cases have melted down in that time period.  Of course, we know the stories of the bankruptcies of BlockFi and Celsius and FTX and Genesis, and Voyager and Alameda. And we also know about the meltdowns of all the crypto tokens, the Luna token, the Terra token, the FTT, token etcetera. In our opinion, these were all very weak use cases, and they were very fragile structures, and it was a matter of time before they do meltdown.  The meltdown of that has created short term negative headwinds for Bitcoin because Bitcoin has cross collateralized with all these other cryptos. But long term, the rationalization of the crypto market will be beneficial for Bitcoin, it has educated an entire generation of investors on the benefits of Bitcoin as a decentralized digital commodity, and the benefits of not having counterparty risk.  It's made, I think, pretty clear what the difference between an asset with an issuer versus an asset without an issuer. And it's also illustrated the benefits of being able to solve custody and the risks of being dependent upon another custodian. The reason that MicroStrategy was able to get through this entire crypto winner is because we weren't exposed directly to any cryptos. Nor did we do business with any of the crypto exchanges and we didn't do it for very clear reasons, because we don't believe in the value proposition of unregistered securities.  And we felt that at some point, eventually, the combination of risky behavior in the crypto industry and the ethical and the legal overhang of the unregistered securities would eventually create a liability.  I think as we go forward, you're going to see much stronger institutions that will be entering the space and they're going to be entering because the industry has rationalized. So the future is fewer assets, fewer -- better institutions, less of the crypto risk taking. And if there is any other result of the crypto winner is, so we can see that everywhere in the world regulators and the general public are enthusiastic about the promise of digital assets. They're hungry for a clear digital asset framework. I think that there'll be more focus on creating a constructive framework and I think people understand better. Why you can't create a digital asset framework based upon unregistered securities without proper disclosure.  We've said before, the only real safe haven for an institutional investor is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the only universally acknowledged digital commodity. And so if you're an investor, Bitcoin is your safe haven in this regard, the others are all question marks, they're all generally unregistered securities and they operate in a regulatory gray zone.  I expect that we will make progress with regard to regulatory developments that will be constructive for the industry. It's not going as fast as we would like. The consistent denial of Bitcoin spot ETFs has been a disappointment. The lack of a clear digital assets framework from coming from regulators or legislators is a disappointment. But having said that, it's pretty clear that that will arrive in time and we do see signs of optimism here auspicious developments. All the FASB initiatives to introduce fair value accounting for Bitcoin is very auspicious development.  The bipartisan support for Bitcoin and for digital assets in general in Congress is an auspicious development. The acknowledgement by all major public figures to Bitcoin is a digital commodity worthy of attention is an auspicious development. And the fact that Bitcoin has managed to survive the meltdown of most of the crypto banks and crypto lenders and most of the crypto exchanges and most of the other crypto assets is a very auspicious development.  So I think 2022 prove the resilience of Bitcoin and then also prove the resilience of MicroStrategy's business model. And now we look excitedly forward to 2023 and 2024, where we think most of the poor behaviors or the irresponsible behaviors have been squeezed out of the system. And most of the inappropriate leverage has been squeezed out of the system.  And I don't think that people in the crypto market will, I don't think they'll engage in the same behaviors that they got away with in the previous few years, because I think the public has been educated. And I think generally, we have a much more sophisticated set of investors and actors in the space, all of which I think is good for Bitcoin.  The last point I'll make on Lightening, Lightening is really spreading rapidly. And it's being adopted by many, many, many businesses. We see dozens and dozens of lightening startups being launched, lots of lightening wallets. We see some exciting applications of lightening. And I think that's only going to continue -- lightening liquidity continues to increase. We as a company have been very pleased with the early results of our lightening R&D effort and MicroStrategy lightening product development. It's quite impressive what you can do with lightening.  I think. Traditionally, the primary criticism of Bitcoin was the slow transaction rate on the base chain made it difficult for people to see how billions of individuals would onboard to the network and how billions of transactions could take place. But now I think as lightening has spread, it's becoming fairly straightforward and quite easy to see how that's going to happen. We're going to see first dozens and then hundreds and then 1000s of layer three applications to move Bitcoin within a custodial network like cash app, or like a coin base, or a binance. And then we're going to see, all of those applications start to knit together with a layer two protocol, which we call lightening.  And as they adopt lightening as their Layer 2 protocol, we'll see, there'll be massive transaction throughput on the Layer 3, and then we will see people depositing and withdrawing satoshis, on layer 2s, and then we'll see the layer 1 will evolve to become the settlement network of the entire global digital monetary system.  And that's why we decided to host a lightening for corporations track at MicroStrategy world coming up in May. This will be a first, to my knowledge. No one's actually hosted a lightening for corporations conference. But we think that 2023 is the right time, it's become increasingly clear that you can build Bitcoin and Satoshis and micro transactions into your products and into your services using the lightening protocol. And I think that there'll be a whole set of breakthrough applications and breakthrough products using lightening. So 2023 is an exciting year and I think we're moving into the most exciting phase of Bitcoin development ever.  Bitcoin is emerging as the grown up institutional asset in the digital ecosystem. And lightening is emerging as the universal language for moving money over IP.  And so with that, I'd like to go and pass the floor back to Shirish to open us up to questions and answers."

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you, Phong. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I'd like to quickly reemphasize MicroStrategy's revenue priorities. Our three-decade long history of providing data analytics solutions to large and small corporations, has established a long tenured and diverse customer mix, where our platform has proven to be a critical component in running our customers businesses day to day.  Our platform has demonstrated durability through tough economic cycles and has been strategic during times of growth, and important foundation to our revenue it is through supporting our existing customers as their businesses evolve. We continue to deliver for our customers as seen in our consistently high renewal rates. And over 90% for the last five consecutive quarters and as high as 95% in Q4 of last year.  Second, growing cloud revenue, which for us means migrating existing customers into a fully hosted and managed cloud subscription model, which Phong talked about earlier. Winning new logos into the cloud is important and uplifting services for existing cloud customers is also critical.  We are very pleased with our performance in all these areas this past year. But keep in mind as we migrate to the cloud we inherently experienced some offsets in areas like audit license and support revenues. However, the transition to a subscription model will establish high quality annual recurring revenues that will allow us to scale even stronger growth in the future.  And Q4 of last year approximately 64% of our total revenue was recurring, compared to approximately 60% in the same quarter over prior year, a trend that we expect will continue in 2023.  Lastly, our consulting business which has been and continues to be essential in providing expert support and solutions to our customers. They not only champion solutions, but they also drive modernization and also impact growth through partner opportunities.  Okay, turning to the results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $132.6 million, down $2 million, or approximately 1% year-over-year. However, at constant currency Q4 total revenues were up 4% year-over-year, similar to the trend we saw in Q3. Total software license revenues were $45 million, up 1% year-over-year, and up 8% at constant currency.  When we look at product license revenues and subscription service revenues together, year-over-year growth on both a GAAP basis and at constant currency continue to show the overall growth momentum or cloud transition.  Subscription service revenues were $17.5 million, an increase of 47% year-over-year and up 54% at constant currency. While product licensed revenues were $27.6 million for the quarter, down 15% year-over-year and product support revenues were $66.8 million down $2.3 million year-over-year, but up 1% at constant currency.  These trends are consistent with revenue themes that I mentioned earlier. Finally, other services revenues were $28.7 million, a slight 1% decrease year-over-year, but an increase at 5% at constant currency. Our worldwide consulting business which makes up the majority of our other services revenues saw higher bill rates globally in Q4, with particularly strong performance among our European and Argentina consultants. To add to that, we're also seeing early success and momentum in the build out number of India workforce, where we plan to grow strategically in future quarters.  Turning to slide 14, we continue to see growth in our software license and subscription billings driven by the continued strong momentum in cloud. Total current software license billings increased to $61 million in the fourth quarter, which was an increase of 10% year-over-year.  Current subscription billings were $31 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year, our 11 straight quarter of double digit growth. And full year \u201822 annual subscription billings was 39% compared to the prior 12 months, with both subscription service revenue and current deferred subscription revenue growing over 40% each year for the full year 2022 compared to 2021.  We are extremely pleased with cloud growth in 2022, which has exceeded expectations in the timeline for transforming and modernizing our BI platform. 2023, will provide to be a pivotal year as well, as we began to see the benefits of the scaling up of our cloud business and the adoption for our customers in the past two years.  Turning to costs. Total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude share based compensation costs were $309 million in the fourth quarter, or $50 million higher year-over-year. $51 million of the year-over-year increase was attributed to Bitcoin impairment charges in the quarter as a result of the price volatility we saw in Q4.  This was driven largely by the clubs of FTX and its impact to the broader digital asset market. The price of Bitcoin which fell to a low of approximately $15,460 during the quarter, which drove the additional impairment for Bitcoin holdings under the current accounting rules.  Non-GAAP cost of revenues were $26 million in the fourth quarter an increase of $2.5 million or 11% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues non-GAAP cost of revenues increased 2% year-over-year, related in part to the growth of our cloud business similar to what we've seen in recent quarters.  Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense decreased $3 million, or 8% year-over-year to $37 million or as a percentage of total revenues lower by 2% year-over-year. This was due in part to a combination of higher net capitalized commissions this quarter, plus some favorable X FX impacts compared to the same quarter in the prior year.  Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $28 million in Q4, a slight increase of $300,000 compared to the prior year. In this area, we continue to prioritize vendors, as Phong mentioned, and increase their talent and resources on average for the year. But we did so intentionally and in a way that kept expenses flat by leveraging a more cost efficient global delivery centers.  Our non-GAAP G&A costs were $21 million, pretty much flat, the decrease of about $400,000 or 2% year-over-year. As Phong mentioned earlier, our focus on lowering costs has been ongoing and frequent with a strict discipline in managing efficient personnel and non-personnel costs. It's not something that we just started thinking about in the second half of last year. In fact, we were fortunate to add this focus even prior to this past year when we did see higher wages and expenses, revenue headwinds due to weaker foreign currencies and we also saw the negative impacts from the war in Ukraine.  Aside from our Bitcoin impairment related expenses, we kept our costs flat year-over-year. Looking forward, we plan to remain cost conscious while continuing to invest in higher end growth areas like optimizing our talent and resources across our growing global footprint focusing on lower cost markets.  On slide 16, total non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter was $177 million, while the digital asset impairment charge for the quarter was at $198 million. As I have said in past quarters since the adoption of our Bitcoin Strategy in Q3 of 2020, the digital asset impairment charges we have incurred each quarter has always been greater than our non-GAAP operating losses, showing the significant impact it has had on our reported income.  On slide 17, as of December 31 2022, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $1.8 billion, compared to approximately $2.2 billion, based on the price of $16,556 as of the last day of the year. So far this year, Bitcoin prices have rallied significantly, along with the market value of our Bitcoins, increasing to approximately $3.1 billion as a close of markets yesterday, and trending even higher since then.  To touch on the regulatory perspective, we continue to be optimistic with the progress that the Financial Accounting Standards Board has made and its steps update how companies measures certain digital assets, including Bitcoin on balance sheets. Since announcing this as an inject agenda item last year, the FASB has moved expeditiously and voted and agreed on how crypto assets should be presented in financial statements and what disclosures should be required under expected fair value accounting standards.  We recognize that what has been completed thus far are just the initial steps in the standard setting process. But we are encouraged that the progress up till now has been aligned with standard fair value practices. We continue to remain committed and supportive of FASB decisions under focus on improved investor transparency for digital assets.  On slide 18, as of December 31 2022, we held a total 132,500 bitcoins, of which 14,890 bitcoins were held directly by MicroStrategy at the parent, with the remaining 117,610 bitcoins, held at the MicroStrategy subsidiary. Although bitcoins held at the sub approximately 34,600 bitcoins are pledged as collateral to Silvergate loan and just over 82,900 bitcoins or 63% of our total Bitcoin holdings, equivalent to approximately $2 billion at the current approximate market value of $23,800 remain unpledged and unencumbered.  Regarding the Silvergate loan, we remain fully in compliance with the loan to value requirements, and as we have detailed in the past, we continue to have sufficient unencumbered collateral to address any foreseeable volatility in Bitcoin prices in the near term. It is worth highlighting again to that if the Bitcoin prices increase and the loan to value ratio is less than 25%, we're able to release any excess collateral from being pledged to the loan. Our current LTV on this loan is now very close, if not at that level.  As Phong mentioned earlier, for the first time in the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 704 Bitcoins that carried a higher tax cost basis compared to the market price of the Bitcoin at the time we sale. The transactions generated capital losses of approximately $34 million which we expect to carry back against previous capital gains. And to the extent such carry backs are available, we expect to generate a tax benefit.  Even with the aforementioned sale, we increased our net holdings by 2500 bitcoins during the quarter. And we continually explore opportunities to use our bitcoins to generate shareholder value, and we may consider pursuing additional transactions that may take advantage of the volatility in Bitcoin prices, or other market dislocations that are consistent with their long term Bitcoin strategy. We will thoughtfully consider any other opportunities in the future and if we choose to pursue anything, we will carefully assess any potential risks and do so in a prudent manner as we have done in the past.  Turning to slide 19, our debt capital structure remains unchanged with the total $2.4 billion of its outstanding debt and convertible instruments, which carry a blended interest rate of approximately 2.1%. The convertible senior notes carry an extremely low cost of funds with the earliest debt maturity not until March 2025. These convertible notes are very attractive in terms of costs, and with over two years remaining until the earlier of the maturities, not outstanding long term capital remains very valuable.  In Q4, we activated a $500 million at the market or ATM equity offering, an issued an aggregate 218,575,000 [ph 0:01:35 part07] of shares Class A common stock at an average gross price per share of approximately $213.16. We raised approximately $46.6 million in gross proceeds, which leaves us with approximately $453 million of outstanding ATM capacity available under our program.  We will continue to evaluate and sell equity under this existing program, when we believe there's an embedded valuation premium in our stock, compared to the market value of our Bitcoin holdings and our estimated value of our software business. Use of those proceeds will be for general corporate purposes, including for the purchase of Bitcoin, or for other general corporate liquidity needs.  As we execute under the program, we will do so with a discipline focus on growing shareholder value, optimizing our capital structure and maintaining adequate liquidity to run and grow our business. The overall liquidity from both our operating and financing activities remains more than sufficient to manage our ongoing working capital needs grow our business as well as manage our debt expense.  Our outlook for 2023 remains cautious but optimistic. We are planning for the recent trends in macro and market volatility to likely persist in the near term. However, we are encouraged that even in this environment of constant change, businesses need actionable data and analytics to succeed. And open architecture to be agile and cloud capabilities to be cost efficient and effective. MicroStrategy delivers all of these.  In 2023, we will target modest constant currency total revenue growth. We will continue to grow cloud subscription billings as a percentage of total revenue and we will continue to strengthen the quality of our recurring revenue as we continue to transform our platform to the cloud. We will remain disciplined and scrutinized costs on investing in growth areas. And we will continue to execute on our dual strategy of growing our business intelligence and acquiring and holding Bitcoin.  Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Thanks, Shirish for the question. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we sold 704 Bitcoin in December, which generated a capital loss, which we expect to carry back against the capital gain from 2019, which was through an old domain name sale. Apart from that sale, we have not sold any other Bitcoin. And, in fact, I think the main takeaway should be that we have continued to increase our total Bitcoin holdings each quarter since inception, including Q4.  And I mentioned this before as well. But, we don't really stop exploring opportunities and thinking of ways to increase shareholder value related to our Bitcoin. And in the future, we may consider doing other things that may take advantage of market volatility or be opportunistic in the market I guess either way anything we do, we'll do it consistently, within the construct of our long term Bitcoin strategy, which is to buy hold and grow. I think fair value accounting is going to be a big plus for corporate adoption. Since clearly, the gap volatility created by indefinite intangible accounting is a negative for CFOs. I think the rollout of lightening for corporations are going to be another big catalyst because the ability to build Bitcoin and play to earn or a Bitcoin rewards or Bitcoin into marketing programs, and to do micro transactions is going to be viewed as a real exciting benefit, it could be a great solution for Chief Marketing Officers, or CHR, or CEOs or heads of sales.  I think that the overtime one big driver is payment networks are inefficient, and slow and expensive. So as companies figure out how to monetize their applications and move small micro transactions around friction free at zero cost, I think that there's going to be an interesting use case for heads of sales and CEOs.  So in short, maybe the last thing is any regulatory clarity that comes from Washington DC, with regard to the digital assets, ecosystem, will be a big driver. And so I think we're all eagerly awaiting some sort of digital assets framework. Bitcoin is, is right now, as I said, the only universally acknowledged digital commodity. And so in a way, it's the one thing you can deal with in the absence of asset framework. But I also think Bitcoin will probably be the biggest winner if there is a digital assets framework, because it'll just accelerate institutional adoption, both on the investor side and the corporate side. So I would look to those three drivers. Thanks, Shirish. So there has been some volatility in our bond prices recently. And just looking back to Q4, we've seen that pretty clearly. But we've also seen that same volatility pretty dramatically rebound prices here in January in a very short period of time. I think with that kind of backdrop, and changes in the market, we are comfortable with our outstanding debt levels. And we're confident than that when it does come due, we will be able to either refinance it, advertise it or pay it off. And we have a lot of different options available to us to manage those maturities. And the fact is, we still have a lot of time left to do so in the next two plus years."

            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2022 fourth quarter and full year financial results. I want to start by recapping our strategy and underscoring our key highlights for the full year 2022. We have two corporate strategies, first, an operating strategy and second a balance sheet strategy.  The Business Intelligence operating strategy is how we generate revenues and where most of our operating costs are incurred, and generates our cash flows. MicroStrategy at this point is the largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company in the world. Our goal is to remain a leader in this space by being modern, open and enterprise oriented. Substantially all our employees in the company over 2100 people are focused on our software business.  Our Bitcoin acquisition strategy is a balance sheet strategy. As of today, we're the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. We were the first public company to adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin for long term. We purchase Bitcoin using our excess cash, and with the net proceeds of capital raising transactions.  I'll address our Bitcoin acquisition strategy first. In the fourth quarter, we purchased 3,204 bitcoins at an average purchase price of $17,616 per Bitcoin. And we sold 704 Bitcoins for the first time, at an average sale price of approximately $16,786 per Bitcoin, resulting a net increase in our Bitcoin holdings of approximately 2,500 for a net aggregate purchase amount $45 million, or approximately $17,850 per Bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses. Andrew will discuss our Bitcoin transactions in the fourth quarter later on this call.  As of December 31 2022, we held a total of 132,500 bitcoins acquired an aggregate cost of $4 billion, or average cost of approximately $30,100 per Bitcoin. We remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy for the long term. In the fourth quarter, the broader crypto and digital assets markets witnessed significant financial distress. In addition, various prominent participants in the digital assets industry filed for bankruptcy, such as FTX, Voyager, Celsius and Genesis. And we do not have direct exposure to any of those companies. In addition, we conducted further diligence of our custodians and execution partners to assess their exposure to these companies and understand that their exposure was minimal.  Since the adoption of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, we've taken a simple approach from day one, which is to buy and hold Bitcoin. We've taken steps along the way to minimize risk, particularly with counterparties. We buy only Bitcoin in U.S. based markets. We custody Bitcoin with institutional grade U.S. based regulated custodians and cold storage, and we have not lended our Bitcoin to third parties for yield or any other purposes. As a result, we've been able to avoid transacting with bad actors in the space.  To summarize our view on Bitcoin. First, we continue to have a high level of conviction in the value proposition of Bitcoin. We're very supportive of the Bitcoin network on a go forward basis. Second, we continue to follow a risk managed approach to executing our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. And third, we're long term focused, we plan to continue to accumulate Bitcoin over time, our core business is not impacted by near term bitcoin price fluctuations.  With that, I will now turn to our software strategy highlights from 2022. We achieve constant currency total revenue growth for 2022 on the strength of our cloud business, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment last year, with high inflation, weakening foreign currencies in the ongoing war in Ukraine.  Total Revenue for 2022 was $499.3 million, which increased 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total software licenses which consists of total product licenses and subscription services revenues in our consolidated statement of operations were $147.2 million, which increased 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis.  We've also made important progress in our shift towards our cloud offering, resulting in annual subscription revenues of $60.7 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Annual subscription billings were $77 million growing 39% year-over-year.  The strong growth in our subscription revenue and billings was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud, and new customer wins. Our customer revenue renewal rates continue to be among the highest we've ever experienced. Overall, we continue to see further global adoption of our cloud platform among our international customers.  We're also seeing the benefits of being a single analytics platform in the industry that is both enterprise grade and easy to use. As an enterprise grade platform, we're benefiting from the trend of BI modernization and consolidation from enterprise tools like SAP Business Objects, and IBM Cognos.  As an easy to use platform for govern Ad Hoc Data Discovery, we are the tool of choice for corporations that have outgrown Microsoft Power BI and Salesforce Tableau are no longer want to be locked into a single vendor ecosystem.  On the cost side, we believe in a thoughtful approach to cost management on an ongoing quarterly basis, rather than annual surges in hiring, followed by mass layoffs. We continue to invest in R&D to innovate our product, while being thoughtful about sales and marketing, and general and administrative cost. As a result, we saw relatively flat operating cost from 2021 to 2022.  Next, I would like to discuss our key focus areas for 2023. First, we aim to launch something called MicroStrategy One [ph 0:04:03 part02], which will serve as our core analytics platform designed to meet all of an organization's analytics needs. It will be easy to use powerful, comprehensive and cutting edge. It's intended to be a one stop shop for all of our business intelligence customers and prospects. You should expect to hear more about this from us throughout the first half of 2023, culminating in our MicroStrategy world event on May 1 through fourth in Orlando, Florida.  Core differentiators for MicroStrategy continue to be our enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and cloud offerings. Our focus on these three areas has resulted in more customers choosing to decommission and consolidate legacy platforms in favor of an enterprise wide adoption of MicroStrategy. So this has led to increasing revenue renewal rates every year in the last three years. Our customers depend on these differentiating capabilities to build mission critical applications to run their field forces, store operations, bank branches, risk analysis groups, corporate operations and much more.  As such, it's worthwhile to highlight the resiliency of our business even in the tough macro conditions that existed in 2022. We're the only remaining publicly traded independent Enterprise BI company, and the stickiness of our products and the long standing tenure of our top customers are testament to our resiliency.  Our continued investment research and development has enabled us to modernize our platform and enable our customers to transform how they do business through innovative analytics tools and techniques. These include personalized applications, immersive interactive, visualizations, simple no code and low code application development with open API's, flexibility of consumption through mobile interfaces, and innovative capabilities like hyper intelligence.  We continue to see growth with customers who build MicroStrategy into the software solutions that they sell to end users, leveraging our open embedded analytics capabilities.  Second, not new, but even more in our focus, is growth. We're going to focus on simplifying our processes growing our pipeline and growing our revenues. We plan to get back in the market and in front of our prospects through in person field events, field marketing, aggressive account based marketing, and a revitalized partner program.  Third, cloud is at front and center, when we talk about focus on growth. As MicroStrategy Cloud continues to be growing part of our business mix, we're seeking to accelerate growth through increased cloud adoption by both new and existing customers. New customers are increasingly cloud first and immediately reap the benefits of our managed service offering. That includes business agility, enterprise security, regular updates and upgrades and cost savings.  At the same time, more and more existing on-premises customers are brought migrating to the cloud and expanding their MicroStrategy usage to new departments and user groups.  Intentional in our approach to cloud is our belief in cloud agility and independence. The power of multi cloud hybrid and the portability between private and public clouds resonates with our customers who do not want to be locked into a single technology stack. We seek to take advantage of the best that each major cloud provider has to offer, optimizing our platform to run on and across each. We'll continue to invest in this area to support our customers need for flexibility, scalability and security.  In Q4, MicroStrategy Cloud for Governments, or MCG is our new cloud offering received authorization to operate under FedRAMP guidelines. MCG is a managed software as a service solution and our first generally available release of our cloud platform that is built on a modern high performance cloud native architecture that also utilizes containers and micro services.  It delivers on sophisticated security and data privacy requirements across the public and private sectors. It opens up the possibility migrating a large part of our business, federal government customers to the cloud.  Our fourth area focus on our employees. Our employees are our key assets. And we will continue to develop and promote people internally and seek to improve employee engagement. Our employee engagement survey results indicate that we have made great improvements to employees, mental wellbeing, loyalty, and belief in the company's two corporate strategies.  We're also continuing to develop technical training and certifications to keep our employees up to date on the latest MicroStrategy software enhancements and soft skills training to keep our managers engaged and employees motivated.  And the last thing is that we'll focus more on innovation, both on business intelligence, as well as on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. On the BI innovation side, MicroStrategy Insights is our first set of products released in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning to augment more traditional reporting capabilities, and provide contextual and immediate insights.  The insights feature accelerates decision making uncovers data patterns with automated alerting, and library applications. The alerts are based on machine learning models working behind the scenes to proactively detect data trends, outliers and anomalies, equipping users with the timely insights to drive action. This is the basis on which we're combining MicroStrategy semantic layer, hyper intelligence and open architecture to provide the data tracking alerts, forecasting recommendations, and ultimately artificial intelligence that will be key for the future of analytics and intelligence.  We believe this is something MicroStrategy is uniquely positioned to provide and we expect to release more functionality in this area every quarter. On the Bitcoin innovation side is indicated on our last earnings call, today I'm delighted to share a preview of MicroStrategy Lightening, our new product that we're developing, which utilizes the lightening network, a second layer network that sits atop to Bitcoin network. We envision MicroStrategy lightening is an enterprise platform designed to leverage the power of the Bitcoin lightening network to enable new ecommerce use cases and tackle modern cybersecurity challenges.  The first component of MicroStrategy lightening platform is lightening rewards, lightening rewards is attended allow any enterprise to reward their employees, customers, partners and prospects for their engagement. Companies spend vast amounts of time and money and digital marketing, driving engagement with their brand and their customers and for some monetizing online contents.  We believe a platform like MicroStrategy lightening can enable them to drive that engagement, rewarding their customers for that engagement directly, rather than lining the pockets of online ad giants. We expect future capabilities the lightening platform will provide opportunities for new business models to monetize online content, or minimize threats and the nuisance of bots and other malicious actors.  While we envision MicroStrategy lightening is independent product offering, it builds on our core strengths and deep experience building highly available, easy to use enterprise software delivered in the cloud. We're taking a very disciplined investment approach such that our lightning development efforts currently occupy less than 1% of our R&D capacity. We're currently in the initial pilot stage of the product with our early prerelease version rolled out internally to MicroStrategy employees. While our core focus remains on BI innovation. We believe we're uniquely positioned to bring value here. Mike will elaborate further on this topic.  Last but not least, I'm thrilled to share again, that our next MicroStrategy world will be in person from May 1 to fourth in Orlando, Florida. Our customers have expressed willingness and desire to for meaningful rich in person connections alongside virtual meetings. So we're bringing back world \u201823 as a bigger scale event with multiple trucks.  The Business Intelligence track on May 1 through fourth will be a working event designed to help modernize analytics for innovative organizations looking to transform with data. We're excited to showcase some of the world's best brands use modern experiences to break through and achieve extraordinary results.  The Bitcoin track on May 3 through fourth will include our third annual Bitcoin for corporations on May 3, and a dedicated lightening for corporations to and May 4. There'll be a first of its kind gathering of corporations looking to integrate Bitcoin and Lightening as a part of their corporate treasury or product offerings.  The conference will also include dedicated networking opportunities workshops and training. And finally MicroStrategy will be incomplete without an epic party. We're hosting a theme park conference party Universal Studios, Florida featuring roller coasters and an evening of unforgettable fun and excitement. We look forward to your participation at the conference. Registrations are open and additional details can be found on our event website at microstrategy.com/world 23.  Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail. Thanks, Shirish. Cloud growth is going very well, in 2022, grew on a revenue basis 46% constant currency and on billions basis up 39%, which both represent a bit of an acceleration in 2022. I think we'll be able to see that same pace of growth or something a little faster will be our goal in 2023. I don't think the macroeconomic headwinds will slow or cloud growth. If anything, we might see a slowness of cloud growth because we're getting into bigger and bigger customers.  Now, we've moved at this point, about 20% of our recurring revenue is in the cloud. So we moved to a good amount of sort of medium sized customers. But that's where MCG MicroStrategy Cloud for Government or a FedRAMP offering is going to help us. There's quite a bit of federal customers, large banks that require some sort of a FedRAMP certification, those will take longer to migrate. But I think that's really this sort of next passion that we'll go after. But I'm pretty excited about where cloud growth is going. And obviously, is getting to be more and more the standard sort of way we sell our software. Yes, the first item, I think the biggest trend we're seeing as customers try to bring down their software costs is consolidation of vendors. And in the BI world, it's really two credible choices for consolidation right now. It's MicroStrategy, if you want a full enterprise solution, it's Power BI, if you want a point, solution that integrates well with the rest of the Microsoft ecosystem.  I think what we've seen in the last six to 12 months is that as more companies are trying to use Microsoft, whether it be Azure, Power BI or otherwise, they're realizing the limitations, there's not a common semantic model, there aren't reusable objects. It's not scalable, it's not as secure. And I think customers are also realizing that free Power BI with your office 365 Enterprise license just means you're going to pay more than Azure cost. And it's a well-worn model where you give certain things away for free to drive more usage costs.  And so we see a lot of customers consolidating on MicroStrategy. And so even though there may be a reduction in overall spend, we get more of the pie. And I'm excited about that. As far as the macro environment, Q4 was more difficult, especially internationally as because customers are trying to spend a little bit less. With that said, we still had a reasonable outcome in terms of our Q4 financials driven by our move to cloud. And I do think 2023 is looking a little bit brighter in terms of companies needing to spend to improve their data and analytics environment. So I'm optimistic about the growth potential in 2023. Like that both are like, we're going to focus on driving revenue growth and profitability or margin growth in 2023. I think big driver, that's our acceleration of conversions to cloud, which allows us to see an uplift and cloud revenue and overall revenue from hosting term licenses and support fees.  And a cost side Andrew mentioned it but we were we kept our costs relatively flat, our operating costs relatively flat from 2021 to 2022. The goal would be to do something similar or even reduce our costs a little bit. If you exclude the impact of the coin holdings. I'm talking about non-GAAP costs here. So if we can grow revenues and keep flat or reduce our costs in 2023, then we should be able to grow margins. And I think if the macroeconomic environment improves faster, we can do that even faster in 2023. Thanks, Shirish. I want to thank everyone for being with us today. And we appreciate all of your support. We're enthusiastic as ever on both of our strategies, our enterprise software strategy and our Bitcoin strategy. I wish you all a good quarter, and happy Spring and looking forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks. Thanks/"

I\u2019ll be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at microstrategy.com. I would like to welcome you all to today's webinar and let you know that we will taking questions using the Q&A feature at the bottom of your screen. You can submit questions throughout the webinar, and Michael, Phong or Andrew will answer questions at the end of the session. Please be sure to provide your name and your company's name when submitting your questions. Now I will walk you through the agenda for today's call. First, Phong Le will cover the operational results for the third quarter of 2022. Second, Andrew Kang will cover the financial results for the third quarter of 2022; then Michael Saylor will provide a strategic review and discuss recent bitcoin market updates. And lastly, we will open up to Q&A. With that, I will turn the call over to Phong Le, President and CEO of MicroStrategy.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2022 third quarter financial results. First, I will focus on the 2022 third quarter business results. We had another good quarter overall, achieving constant currency total revenue growth on the strength of our cloud business. This, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment in Q3 with continuing high inflation, weakening foreign currencies in the ongoing war in Ukraine. We had strong growth in our subscription revenue and billings driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer revenue renewal rates continue to be amongst the highest we've ever experienced. To summarize our third quarter software results, revenues increased 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total software licenses revenue, which consists of product -- total product licenses and subscription services revenues in our consolidated statement of operations increased 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We benefited from the increased adoption of our cloud platform, partially offset by a decrease in product license revenues. Over time, we expect our revenue profile to continue to shift towards recurring subscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased 59% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Current subscription billings grew 79% year-over-year, our 10th straight quarter of double-digit growth and our best quarter ever. We've also seen further global adoption of our cloud platform among our international customers, including customers in the Asia Pacific region, with several major wins in Q3. We've also seen further growth of our embedded business with multiple new logos. Next, I'd like to provide some observations from my first 90 days of being the CEO of MicroStrategy. I spent more time in the field in the US and internationally, listening to our customers and employees and learning from them. What I learned first is that our customers continue to love our product offerings. There are people that have built their careers on the MicroStrategy platform and dedicated to our success and see us rising above the fray of basic visualization tools. They're also excited about modernizing, consolidating their BI platforms in an open multi-cloud environment.  Accordingly, we'll continue to focus on three key areas of growth that represent core MicroStrategy differentiators, enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and the cloud. Our customers depend on these differentiating capabilities to build mission-critical applications to run their field forces, store operations, bank branches, risk analysis groups, corporate operations and much more.  I'll also focus more on innovation. Our continued investment in research and development has enabled us to modernize our platform and enable our customers to transform how they do business through innovative analytics, tools and techniques. These include personalized applications, immersive interactive visualizations, simple no-code and low-code application development with open APIs, flexibility of consumption for mobile interfaces and innovative capabilities like HyperIntelligence.  We continue to see growth from customers who build MicroStrategy into the software solutions that they sell to end users, leveraging our open embedded analytics capabilities. Looking forward, we recognize the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to augment more traditional reporting capabilities and provide contextual and immediate insights.  In Q3, we released our first set of products in this area called MicroStrategy Insights. This is the basis on which we are combining MicroStrategy Semantic layer, Hyper intelligence and open architecture to provide the data tracking, alerts, forecasting, recommendations and artificial intelligence that will be key for the future of analytics and intelligence. We believe this is something MicroStrategy is uniquely positioned to provide, and we expect to release more functionality in this area every quarter.  Another interesting area where we can differentiate our offerings is Bitcoin Lightning software development for the enterprise. We are in the initial stage of exploring innovative lightning applications for cybersecurity use cases to help enterprise customers through networks, monetize websites and deploy wallets in mass using Bitcoin. While our core focus remains on BI innovation, we believe we are uniquely positioned to bring value in this area also. Mike will elaborate further on this topic.  As MicroStrategy Cloud continues to be a growing part of our business mix. we seek to accelerate growth through increased cloud adoption by both new and existing customers. New customers are increasingly cloud-first and immediately reap the benefits of our managed service offering. Those include business agility, enterprise security, regular updates and upgrades and cost savings. At the same time, more and more existing on-premise customers are migrating to the cloud and expanding their MicroStrategy usage to new departments and user groups. Intentional in our approach to cloud is our belief in cloud agility. The power of multi-cloud, hybrid and the portability between private and public clouds resonates with our customers who do not want to be locked into a single technology stack. We take advantage of the best that each major cloud provider has to offer, optimizing our platform to run on and across each. We will continue to invest in this area to support our customers' needs for flexibility, scalability and security. We're eagerly awaiting final authorization to operate for the launch of MicroStrategy Cloud for government, our new cloud offering with FedRAMP authorization. This product will be our first generally available release of our cloud platform that relies on a modern cloud native architecture, utilizing containers and microservices. It will open up the possibility of migrating a large part of our business, Federal Government customers to the cloud. It also serves as proof of our enterprise-grade security, stability and scalability via certifications for large enterprises, previously reluctant to move to the cloud like those in the financial services industry. The combination of FedRAMP authorization, enterprise-grade capabilities and managed service delivery will help us further differentiate our solutions with government customers, our enterprises and embedded analytics customers worldwide. Our focus on enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and cloud services has resulted in more customers choosing to decommission and consolidate legacy platforms in favor of an enterprise-wide adoption of MicroStrategy. This has led to increasing revenue renewal rates every year in the last three years. Another observation for my time meeting customers is their willingness and desire for hybrid interactions that includes meaningful rich in-person connections alongside virtual meetings. Accordingly, I'm thrilled to share that our next MicroStrategy world will be back in person. From May 1 to 4 in Orlando, Florida. World23 will be a working event designed to help modernize analytics for innovative organizations looking to transform with data. We decided to showcase some of the world's best brands use modern experiences to break through and achieve extraordinary results. The conference will also include dedicated networking opportunities, workshops and training as well as our third annual Bitcoin for Corporations event. Registration is opened November 8, and additional details can be found on our Event website at microstrategy.com/world23. Turning to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We continue the commitment to our strategy in Q3 and purchased 301 additional Bitcoins for approximately $6 million at an average purchase price of $19,000 \u2013 $19,860 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. We have not sold any Bitcoin to date. To reiterate our strategy, we seek to acquire and hold Bitcoin for the long-term. And we do not currently plan to engage in sales of Bitcoin. We have a long-term time horizon and the core business is not impacted by the near-term Bitcoin price fluctuations. As a final comment, I would say macro and market volatility are expected to be the new normal. We believe change is constant. In this world, businesses need actionable data, enterprise-grade analytics, multi-cloud capabilities and open architecture and customer success focus. MicroStrategy delivers this. Our competition prefers dashboard proliferation, departmental visualizations, single stack vendor lock-in and price increases. This market volatility may impact our financial results in the short-term, as we target modest constant currency revenue growth during our cloud transition. This will require us to be financially prudent, investing our platform, while applying a thoughtful approach to costs with the objective of remaining at least margin neutral in the short-term. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew, to discuss our financial results for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. I'll start by highlighting our third quarter 2022 financial results in more detail. GAAP total revenues for the quarter were $125.4 million, down $2.6 million or 2% year-over-year. Isolating the impacts on foreign exchange, total revenue was up 4% year-over-year at constant currency. Total software license revenues, which is a total of product license revenues and subscription services revenues were $38.7 million, up 5% year-over-year, and up double digits or 11% at constant currency. As we continue to migrate our customers to the cloud, we know that product licenses revenues will naturally decline as revenues previously recognized upfront are converted to revenues recognized over a longer period as subscription services revenues. When we look at the two together, year-over-year increases on both a GAAP basis and at constant currency are positive indicators that we are successfully moving our customers to the cloud not only on a stand-alone basis, but as well as contributing to the overall growth of our software platform. In line with what I just described, subscription services revenues were $16.4 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year and up 59% at constant currency. Product licenses revenues were $22.3 million for the quarter, which was $3.5 million lower year-over-year, while product support revenues were $66 million, down $4.4 million year-over-year, relatively flat at constant currency. As Phong mentioned earlier, our Q3 renewal rate was again at 95% this past quarter, demonstrating the durability of our platform and the long-standing nature of our customer base. Finally, other services revenue, which primarily reflects our consulting business was $20.7 million, a slight decrease year-over-year but a 7% increase in constant currency. Our highly skilled and experienced consultants continue to support, innovate and modernize our platform across our customer base. And we have been very successful in delivering consulting services across our global delivery centers in the US, Europe, South America and Asia, while optimizing costs and increasing billable hours year-over-year. Moving to billings. Our total current software license billings were $36.4 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year, and in the third quarter, subscription -- current subscription billings were $14.4 million, an increase of 79% year-over-year. This is in comparison to the increase of 51% year-over-year in Q2. This sequential growth was driven by solid results in both subscription services revenues, as well as current deferred subscription services revenues. It is also worth noting again that we sold our largest cloud billings as multiyear contracts with an average term of over 24 months, of which only 12 months are currently reflected on our balance sheet. We believe our cloud transition is successfully underway, and the demand from our customers to migrate MicroStrategy to the cloud remains very strong with additional pipeline being added from both our domestic and international customers. Shifting to costs. Total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude share-based compensation costs were $102 million in the third quarter, compared to $165 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our total non-GAAP costs this quarter were significantly lower year-over-year, as well as compared to Q2 of this year. This was primarily due to stable Bitcoin prices this quarter, which led to a nominal $700,000 Bitcoin impairment charge in contrast to the $65 million charge in Q3 of 2021. The Bitcoin volatility as measured by the one-month realized volatility fell below that, of the major equity indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ this past quarter. We view this recent market shift as a possible signal that Bitcoin's investor base and institutional adoption is continuing to mature, making it more suitable and accepted by traditional market participants. During the quarter, Bitcoin prices remained above our carrying value, low watermark of approximately $17,600 \u2013 and as a result, we saw a minimal digital asset impairment charge in Q3. Non-GAAP cost of revenues were $24 million in the third quarter, an increase of $2.6 million or 12% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP cost of revenues was up 2% year-over-year attributed to higher cloud hosting fees and investments in technology and talent as we continue to scale up to support our growth in cloud. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $30 million, which was a decrease of $4.1 million or 12% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP sales and marketing costs were lower by 3%, and year-over-year, primarily due to higher net capitalized commissions this quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $27 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 6% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize research and development in our core software business as we invest in personnel supporting innovation, cybersecurity and growth in cloud. Non-GAAP G&A costs were $20 million, which was an increase of $1.4 million or 7% year-over-year. As we emphasized earlier, the uncertain macroeconomic environment and inflationary trends continue to present headwinds to our bottom line, and we believe these challenges are the new normal. Although, we see strong growth in cloud and high sustained renewal rates, managing rising costs is critical to weathering the current environment. We plan to be extremely disciplined in controlling costs in the near term as we navigate these conditions, and we will continue to cut costs in certain areas, while prioritizing spend that we believe will drive revenue growth. On slide 13, total non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $23 million, reflecting a non-GAAP margin of 18%. The very small Bitcoin impairment charge this past quarter that I mentioned earlier had a minimal impact on our reported results and was the lowest digital asset impairment charge since we launched our Bitcoin strategy in Q3 of 2020. In a reporting period, where there are minimal impairment charges under the current accounting rules, we believe our non-GAAP operating income better represents the underlying performance of our core software business. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2 billion, which reflects approximately $2 billion in cumulative impairment charges incurred through the end of Q3. As you know, GAAP accounting treats our Bitcoin holdings as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, which means that any decrease in the fair value below our carrying value any time after date of acquisition requires us to recognize an impairment. Conversely, when prices increase, the current accounting rules did not allow us to increase the carrying value. On October 12, the Financial Accounting Standards Board unanimously voted to recommend the adoption of fair value accounting for all public and private companies in measuring certain digital assets, including Bitcoin. Under current fair value accounting standards, both decreases and increases in the fair market value of an asset would be recognized in GAAP earnings. We understand this is an initial step in the standard-setting process and many of the details and disclosures have yet to be determined, but we are extremely encouraged and supportive of the FASB's decision for the change and the improved investor transparency it should provide. We believe this is an extremely positive step for the future of digital asset accounting, and we remain committed as we have in the past to supporting these efforts. Turning to Slide 15. Our debt capital structure consists of a $500 million senior secured note, a $205 million Bitcoin back loan and $1.7 billion of convertible senior notes, all with a blended interest rate of approximately 2%, the earliest maturity, which is not until March 2025. We have also issued $1 billion of equity through previously announced At The Market or ATM offering in Q3 and Q4 of 2021. Recently, on September 9, we filed a prospectus supplement for an additional ATM equity offering, which will allow us to sell up to $500 million of Class A common shares from time to time into the market. As of October 31, 2022, we have not sold any shares under this program. We intend to use the ATM under a disciplined approach to sell equity, if and when we believe there is an embedded value premium in our stock, compared to the market value of our Bitcoin holdings and our estimated value of our enterprise analytics software business. The use of proceeds will be for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin. Our focus is in managing capital will continue to be that of accreting shareholder value, optimizing our overall capital structure and ensuring adequate liquidity to run our operations and service our debt. On Slide 16, as of September 30, 2022, we held a total of 130,000 Bitcoins, of which 14,890 Bitcoins were held directly by MicroStrategy at the parent. All of which secure our 2028 notes. The remaining 115,110 Bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy -- I'm sorry, MacroStrategy, our subsidiary. In Q3, there was no change to the number of Bitcoins pledged at MacroStrategy. Of the Bitcoins held at the sub, approximately 30,000 Bitcoins are pledged as collateral to our Bitcoin back loan and just over 85,000 Bitcoins or 65% of our total holdings, equivalent to approximately $1.7 billion at the current market price of $20,400 remain unpledged and unencumbered. As you can see, we have more than sufficient collateral to meet the ongoing requirements of our Bitcoin back loan today and through any current foreseeable price volatility. As Paul mentioned earlier, our Bitcoin strategy remains simple. We have bought and held Bitcoin and will continue to do so. Finally, before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to reemphasize that MicroStrategy's principal core strategies are to operate and grow our enterprise analytics business and to acquire and hold Bitcoin as a treasury reserve for the long-term. This hybrid strategy represents a paradigm shift where we seek to maximize the performance of both segments of our business, while identifying and capitalizing on the synergies that come from combining a mature and profitable enterprise software business with a large-scale digital asset holding. Thank you for your time today and for your support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Andrew, and thank you to all of our shareholders that are with us here today. I would like to provide a performance review of the company's results since we adopted a Bitcoin strategy. And I'm delighted to report to all the shareholders that since MicroStrategy adopted the Bitcoin strategy on August 11, 2020, our stock has outperformed all of the major asset classes that we benchmark ourselves against. It has outperformed all big tech stocks, and we have outperformed all enterprise software stocks that we benchmark ourselves against. You can see from this chart, we are up as of 4:00 P.M. yesterday, October 31 we were up 116%, since we embarked on this strategy. And we -- I think the most important benchmark we compare ourselves against is Bitcoin itself. And Bitcoin in that same time period is up 72%. So we have managed by our strategy to capture all of the Bitcoin gains with a boost. Now if we compare the Bitcoin performance in that 2.25 years to other assets, the S&P is up 15%. So a diversified portfolio of really high-quality stocks are 15%. the NASDAQ is effectively zero percent. So there is no gain in the NASDAQ. Gold, and many of you have followed us in our journey will recall that -- when we started on this path, our number one question was, should we buy Bitcoin or should we buy gold. Gold is down 19%. In that same time period, the Bitcoin is up 116%. That makes sense to us. Gold is the hard money solution for the 19th century, and Bitcoin is the hard monetary asset for the 21st century. But I think it's auspicious that we see the market is agreeing with us after these 24 months or so, 26 months. The bond index, and that's really BOND, -- it's still -- it's long bonds, about 20-year duration bonds. They have lost 22% of their value in this time frame. So bonds are obviously not holding value in the interest rate environment we're struggling with, and they have limited upside generally. And of course, silver, which is sort of a weaker precious metal than gold is down 33%. So, I think, when you look at the story here, Bitcoin is winning, but MicroStrategy is winning even more than the Bitcoin right now because of our levered long Bitcoin strategy we pursued. We benchmark ourselves against big tech stocks, and of course, three of the most extraordinary stocks and companies in the modern era are Apple, Google and Microsoft. And of course, Apple is up 36%, about one-fourth of our performance results and our stock. Google was up 27%. Microsoft is only up 11%. So MicroStrategy stock is 10x. Microsoft, even though Microsoft, of course, is the most successful software company on the planet. The challenge with equities, as we all know, is that you have not just monetary risk due to macroeconomics, but you also have execution risk. And so -- and you have all sorts of other types of risks. So Amazon is down 35% because of their challenges, which I won't go into. Netflix is down 40%, and META Group Facebook is down 65%. So you can see, of course, this mix performance is probably what drives the 0% NASDAQ result. And if we look at the mega enterprise software stocks, of course, Oracle is the monster enterprise software copy, they're up 42%. It's very well run and very stable, but they don't have the benefits of a Bitcoin balance sheet. IBM stock up 14%, salesforce down 18%, S&P down 40%. So even though I think there's a lot of publicity about the volatility of Bitcoin and some of the non-cash charges we've taken, the real interesting story here is that MicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin strategy is the winner against all of these other strategies over the last 2.25 years. We generally pick August 10, 2020, as that date to go back to because that was the date before we purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin, and we announced a $250 million Dutch auction or share buyback. And so that was a pretty critical point in the history of the company. Before that date, we are operating the software business without any treasury strategy and we had our $500 million in cash invested in short-term treasuries zero to 12-month treasury bills. And our primary strategy was either to buy the stock back or invest in treasuries. And after that date, we had a Bitcoin strategy that was implemented on $250 million. And then we had to wait until the end of the Dutch auction around September 10th of 2020 before we knew what was going to happen next. And then we had $175 million, which we invested in Bitcoin, and we have continued with our consistent Bitcoin long strategy since. I'd like to talk a little bit about the macro environment. And so we'll switch off to the slide for a second. The most important thing that's happened in the past 12 months is the risk-free interest rate in the world, and I don't just mean the Western world, the entire world has gone from 12 basis points to 465 basis points. That's the one-year treasury rate on US treasuries. And that's an extraordinary climb. In the middle of 2018, the one-year rate was about 280 basis points. It coasted down to about 150 basis points in January of 2020. And then it nose dived to just a few basis points, five to 10 basis points in March of 2020. The risk-free rate was effectively nothing for the next 18 months. And then when the Central Bank began to perceive inflation as being the priority more so than economic stimulus, these interest rates start getting increased and they got increased at the most rapid rate in 40 years. So we find ourselves in a situation right now where for the last 12 months, the risk-free rates have increased by a factor of 50, financial assets have all suffered, and that means gold, equities, bonds, et cetera, and crypto assets and Bitcoin, so we're all living that. I don't have to tell you about that. I think you understand that. The important point right now is that, we're now at a seriously inverted yield curve. The three-month bond rate for treasuries is about 417 basis points and the 30-year treasury bond rate is 410 basis points. So in essence, you make more money buying a three-month bond and a 30-year bond. This is probably not sustainable for the long term.  The classic interpretation would be that the yield curve is pointing toward expectation of recession, and the reason the 30-year rate is higher than the 3-month rate is an expectation that eventually the Fed will begin to loosen monetary policy and lower rates. I would say you could almost say that, our monetary policy was kind of to devalue the currency, weaken the currency, if not crash the currency for the first year of the pandemic crisis and now the monetary policy is ripping the wings off the economy for the last year. And we see the wings starting to come off. All of the currencies in the world have been crashing against the dollar and created a massive macroeconomic headwind. The pound and the euro are off about 15% against the dollar in the last 12 months. Japanese yen is down about 23% that manifests itself in a couple of impacts.  One is for any company that's primarily US-based or USD based sees that it's struggling against these foreign currency headwinds and its revenues and its earnings. And MicroStrategy suffered from that this quarter. We're selling in yen and euros and pounds and those in euros and pounds are being devalued 15% to 23% in the last 12 months. So that's a bit of a headwind.  I'm pleased to say that I think our P&L has held up really well against that macroeconomic headwind and we're happy about that. I think the other implication is there's -- this is exporting inflation to the rest of the world. So, commodities are priced in dollars like oil and so as the euro and the pound and the yen weakened, the cost to buy oil in those nations explodes and so we're seeing double-digit inflation throughout Europe, throughout the rest of the world. This is creating protests, social unrest, there are riots in some \u2013 in streets in Eastern Europe.  This is also creating a crisis amongst a number of conventional institutional investors. We just saw this manifest itself in the crisis in the UK, that resulted in the early resignation of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. That happened when they attempted to lower taxes, it created a crisis of confidence in the markets and a 30 and 40-year British pound bond rates exploded into the 505 handle range the markets aren't really holding 5% to 6% interest rates very well. When that happens, that creates a margin call on anyone that's using those instruments is their primary treasury reserve asset.  And \u2013 so the result is the markets hiccup and they reached and the entire government collapsed in the UK. I think that that's a warning sign. We can see that challenge. We can see in Japan right now, they've had to intervene to support the yen, which has also been collapsing and there's very explicit intervention. This is being viewed, I think, in the United States, and the rest of the Western world. And the takeaway is we're just to the point where we're either going to rip the wings off the economy, if we keep raising interest rates much more, or if the interest rates get into the 5% to 6% zone, we're going to undermine the balance sheets of pension funds and other major investors. And this is on international global problem that results in a lot of pressure on central bankers to slow down the rate of interest rate increases. And we see that manifested with people coming on CNBC, pointing out that they have to slow this down. We see political pressure to taper. We see international pressure on the US government from all these other nation states that have their currencies crashing on the Federal Reserve to taper this rise. So we're approaching some sort of macroeconomic inflection point. It's not clear when we get there, but we know that when 30-year bonds and 40-year bonds or 5.5%, the entire government of the U.K. collapses. And we know that the Japanese yen is now laboring because they're trying to hold a 10-year rate of 25 basis points in Japan, while the US 10-year rates served with a four handle. All of these things are suggesting that the current trend of continuing to raise the risk-free rate can't continue too much longer, the resistance of the tightening is increasing. And that takes me to just a discussion of the Bitcoin strategy right now and fundamentals. I think the summer here is over the last 12 weeks, the Bitcoin fundamentals have improved. As Andrew pointed out, volatility of bitcoin shifted for being more volatile than NASDAQ and highly correlated to being less volatile than NASDAQ and not so much correlated in the past three months. That's really bullish, I think, for the asset class and auspicious. The other fundamental developments are auspicious. BNY Mellon officially announced its Bitcoin custody services. That's very auspicious because that's probably the first major bank that stepped up into that business. Block upgraded Cash App and Cash up is a 40 million user type mobile application, and they upgraded it in their support of Lightning. So now they can send and receive lightning to Cash App mobile application instances. And they did it with a universal barcode. And so that means that I can hold the barcode up on my phone, and you can scan it, and it will either send a Bitcoin on the base layer, the Layer 1, if that's what you requested or it will send it on the Lightning layer. We're already seeing this create a massive amount of enthusiasm in the Lightning development community. It's launched a lot more lightning wallets. It's launched a lot more vendor interest in taking Bitcoin as lightening payments. And One of the more interesting stories right now is a supermarket chain call Pick-N-Pay, all around South Africa. Pick-N-Pay rolled out Lightning payments to 40 of their stores in production as the second stage of their Bitcoin adoption. And that appears to have been successful. There are a lot of videos circulating around and people going in and paying in a matter of seconds via Lightning transactions off of Android and iPhones, but the more important point is that their stated plan is to deploy Bitcoin Lightning support to 1,628 stores. So the broad-based adoption of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange via Lightning technology is now being taken seriously with the Cash App example, with the Pick-N-Pay example. This is getting a lot of attention in the community. And of course, the benefit to the retailer would be not only is it almost no fee, but it's also instant settlement. And it also appeals to the crypto friendly. And right now, across South America and Africa, people are becoming much, much more interested in the entire crypto area and Bitcoin, in particular, because the currencies are crashing. The Nigerian Niara has an official exchange rate in the 400 range. But it's government managed and the actual exchange rate is crashing to 800 to the $1, and they're announcing they're going to swap out the currency for a different currency. So what you see is you see a wholesale currency crashes, devaluations and bank failures and capital controls are spreading like wildfire throughout Asia, South America and Africa. And the solution to the population is a $50 Android phone running a mobile wallet like the Lightning wallet. And of course, this becomes a matter of great passion to them. And of course, it also becomes a matter of passion to the merchants because if the merchants can't get paid in hard currency, and they have to go through multiple layers of credit, then their businesses are also at risk. So that's a great fundamental development to Bitcoin, because traditionally, the view of Bitcoin is it's just a store of value because it runs on a Level 1 transaction network with only seven transactions a second. But now that people are saying that it's infinitely scalable over the Lightning Network, it's not just the store value. It's a game-changing technology that you can build into a mobile app on billions and billions of mobile devices. And so this is becoming very, very interesting and it's changing the narrative with regard to Bitcoin. Another big development that happened this quarter is FASB made the fair value decision by a vote of seven to zero. It doesn't mean that we have enough guidance to change our accounting. But -- but if we consider what happens next, we know we have unanimous support to adopt fair value accounting for Bitcoin. The next thing will have to be some guidance around and decisions around what the disclosure forms will be -- after that, there will have to be guidance about the transition plan, then they'll need some public commentary. And after they've internalized or absorbed all the public comments on the transition plan and the guidance, then I think that we'll see \u2013 we will see companies like MicroStrategy and anyone holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet, adopt fair value accounting, and that will be a huge benefit to the asset class. Bitcoin benefited by a few other things this quarter. First of all, noted recognition by the heads of the CFTC and the SEC. They both mentioned Bitcoin favorably and noted it to be a commodity. And so this is -- this was very auspicious and this has been noticed by the entire crypto industry and by the mainstream investment community. I think there's been an increase in DeFi hacks in the crypto industry this quarter. But that actually is just underscored how much more secure Bitcoin is and why Bitcoin is the institutional safe haven investment-grade asset, because in the same quarter where there are lots of DeFi hacks and crypto hacks, people are reminded again that there are no Bitcoin hacks and there have been no Bitcoin hacks. And that's a comforting differentiator. There's been an increase in SEC crypto enforcement actions, and this is serving to educate an entire generation of crypto investors as to the difference between a commodity and security. And I think that as people become educated as to the difference, they realize that there's a great benefit to holding a commodity and Bitcoin is the only crypto asset universally acknowledged to be a commodity. And so I think that the world is getting educated there. And then last point I'll make is that the Bitcoin hash rate is hitting an all-time high right now, and there are notes that people suggesting they see a touching 300 exahashes. So throughout the crypto winter and all the volatility, the Bitcoin hash rate has continued to expand. And people often ask, well, what is Bitcoin back by. It's backed by the most powerful crypto computing network in the world, which is also the most powerful computing network on earth, like so powerful that it's orders of magnitude more powerful than the hash rate that could be generated by all of the Microsoft, Amazon, and Google cloud computing hardware, if it were all turned against the network. So the fact that the Bitcoin has this wall of crypto energy, 300 exahash of it makes the entire asset censorship resistant, hack resistant. It gives it integrity. It gives a longevity. It makes it neutral. And ultimately, it provides the security that you need if you're going to put large amounts of monetary energy or wealth into Bitcoin. So oftentimes, people are spreading FUD, and their FUD will be something like well, the transaction rates will decrease and that will cause the security budget to go to zero, or if the price goes down, people will stop expanding the network. What we can see right now is that the Bitcoin network is adding additional security and the capital that gets invested in the security has about a six to eight-year delay versus when people made the decision. So the natural frequency of the Bitcoin network is eight years, eight years after a disaster catastrophe, you will start to see some mitigating effect, perhaps the hash rate will slightly slow down in its growth rate. But what we can see here is that people are adding, hashing equipment, Bitcoin mining equipment now that was purchased two years ago to the network. And so this is a very good thing for a crypto commodity. And what we see is Bitcoin performing just as you would expect it to perform, you know, as the most anti-fragile digital asset in the world. So with that, I'd like to thank everybody for your time and attention. I guess, Shirish, we're ready for questions\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Great. Thank you, Michael. We are going to jump right into questions. And the first question is for Phong. How is demand faring across geographies and industries? You mentioned that you did well in the Asia Pacific region. Are there any particular areas of strength or weaknesses to call out?\nPhong Le: Thanks, Shirish. Yeah. When I mentioned we did well in the Asia Pacific region. It was related to cloud, and primarily because cloud adoption started in the US. I think over the last year, we've seen it start to grow quite a bit in the European region and Latin America. And most recently, we saw it start to grow in APAC. So that was notable just because we're seeing global adoption of cloud. As far as overall, if you look at our results, I still think macroeconomic impacts, geopolitical challenges, Ukraine war has an outsized impact on Europe. So we're seeing a little bit of a challenge there compared to the rest of the world. And that's probably the only thing I would note geographically that we're seeing right now.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Phong. Another one for you. It's good to see the continuation of your strong renewal trend. Are you seeing long-standing customers budget their MSTR spend any differently?\nPhong Le: Yeah, you know, as I mentioned earlier, what I am seeing is a consolidation of I spend around the world, especially on to enterprise providers like ourselves. So less experimental tools, more and less departmental tools, more enterprise tools. So I am seeing -- and we are seeing customers reinforce their commitment to MicroStrategy over time, which has been a positive thing, and that manifests itself both in terms of renewal rates, but also in terms of customers migrating to cloud with us. Migrating to cloud is just another reinforcement and their belief in MicroStrategy and what we have to offer. So that our cloud subs billing was the strongest we ever had. I think part of that is because of the strength of our platform and all the investments we're making into R&D, and what I consider to be the right places that our customers care about.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you. Next question. Can you comment on the wage inflation that MicroStrategy is seeing what levers do you have available to attract and keep talent, whether by increasing stock or cash comp or hiring internationally? And also, can you expand on the hiring goals in the short-term? Do you plan to make headcount changes due to the current macro environment? So a question for both Andrew and Phong?\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Shirish. I\u2019ll take -- I can start with the first part of that question. I'd say wage inflation for us has been pretty consistent with the overall market. And I'd say that -- it's probably been the most competitive leading up to Q3. I feel like we're seeing competition for talent slow a with general recession fears and cost cutting in the overall technology sector in more recent months. I think we have used stock-based comp across our departments and geographies, which has definitely been a useful tool in retaining talent. I think the last thing I'd say, too, is just keeping in mind that MicroStrategy's talent base across the entire organization, including a very critical role such as in sales and in tech are extremely tenured and our attrition rates are trending, I'd say, lower than our internal targets in recent months.\nPhong Le: And the only thing I'd add is wage inflation is real. Competition for talent is real. It's improved a little bit like Andrew said, we also have folks, especially in our technology teams have been with the company five, tens, fifteen 20 years are years and quite loyal. \u2013 and we like to return that loyalty in terms of comp increases, stock-based comps. So I think we're doing the right things there. I do think, going forward, given macro factors, given volatility, we need to be pretty smart about how we manage, how many more people we add to the organization. So we'll be pretty smart about managing our costs or trying to keep our costs relatively flat \u2013 on headcount. It's just the right thing to do, prudent thing to do with our business right now.\nShirish Jajodia: Next question is for Phong again. Have you seen any changes in the competitive environment as vendors particularly on the private side look to bring down the cash burn?\nPhong Le: Yeah. It's similar to the renewal question. I do think vendors \u2013 do you think customers are reducing the number of vendors. So we're on average before COVID, a large enterprise might have 7 to 12 BI vendors. I think that number is cut in at least half \u2013 and again, that's generally a positive for us. So maybe their overall spend goes down, but their allocation towards MicroStrategy should increase over time. And that's the trend we're starting to see and a trend we hope to continue to see in the future. But we don't take for granted any of our customers, and we need to keep providing awesome product, awesome services, awesome support.\nShirish Jajodia: Next question is for Michael. The broader crypto market and the underlying technology is constantly evolving. How would you characterize Bitcoin's performance relative to broader crypto space over the last quarter?\nMichael Saylor: I think Bitcoin's continue to strengthen for the past quarter against the broader crypto space. I think the market is getting more educated institutional investors are getting more educated. I think there is the momentum on the technology side is lurching away from the other cryptos toward Bitcoin. There's real explosion and enthusiasm in the Lightning community, and there are a lot of Lightning start-ups, Lightening incubators, there's more venture capital starting to look at lightening in particular. So I think Bitcoin's technology story is improving. I think it's \u2013 and I think the story is an asset is also improving. We've got surveys that just came out from Fidelity and gray scale that that show remarkable enthusiasm and interest among institutional investors for bitcoin and an expectation that, it will be part of their portfolio going forward, and those numbers have never been higher.\nShirish Jajodia: Next question for Michael as well. Looking out two to three years, what are some of the positive catalysts we should look out for around broader Bitcoin adoption?\nMichael Saylor: I think we're going to start to see more companies building it into their 401(k). There's like a 12-month delay there, but I think that integrating Bitcoin into traditional finance and traditional investment products is one. I think in time, we'll see a spot Bitcoin ETF and more ETFs and it will be built into more financial adviser type programs. That's the second. I think you start to see more large banks similar to BNY Mellon starting to offer crypto custody services. And either Bitcoin trading or Bitcoin custody or Bitcoin-backed loans. So as the traditional banking establishment embraces Bitcoin, I think that's going to be another milestone. I think we can see with the FASB process. They began to look at this in late 2020, mid-2021, and probably it will be late 2023, it will be fiscal year 2024 when the financial or accounting changes take place. So there tends to be a two to four year delay in all of the institutional adoption of regulators, but once the momentum gets going, it continues. So the supportive actions of the CFTC and the supportive actions of the SEC and the supportive actions that have taken place at FASB will drive more supportive actions across the other regulatory agencies. I would expect when you start to see concrete guidance from the FDIC that will be another big milestone. And of course, we have a number of bills in Congress right now that would provide regulatory frameworks that would accelerate the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. I don't know of any legislation that would be viewed as negative for the asset class. So any of this work that's being done should be positive for the asset class. And so all of those are the fundamental milestones. I think we keep our eye on. And of course, ultimately, the macroeconomic wind has a big impact. So when the wind is to our back, it's beneficial to the asset class when the wind is to your face and blowing at you, it's more of a challenge. But over time, these things go full circle.\nShirish Jajodia: Next question is for Andrew, and this is regarding the overall Bitcoin investment decision. So can you please provide color on how you make the decision to invest in Bitcoin, whether from cash flows generated from software business or proceeds raised from capital markets activity. And are there scenarios such as more severe market downturn or other material changes to the business that could lead to you to tactically change your investment plan?\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Shirish. I think the short answer is we consider all of the above. We have demonstrated that when we have excess cash from operations in any given quarter, those excess proceeds can be used to buy Bitcoin. We've done that in the past few quarters. As well as proceeds from larger capital markets activities, I think you can continue to expect the same pretty simple strategy going forward. In terms of potential more severe macro downturn, I think we do not have any plans to adjust our Bitcoin strategy. We do, as we always have viewed our investment as a long-term view, importantly, through cycles, including the one we're in now, and we will continue to believe in that core principle.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. Next question is for Phong. What is the impact of the macro conditions? Are you seeing new deals slowing within the space, or is it taking longer to get approvals? And has the macro environment -- is it impacted due to -- or is it -- has it impacted the cloud migrations?\nPhong Le: I don't think the macro environment, as of now, is causing fewer deals or fewer cloud migrations. But I think it's reasonable to say that our deals are taking a little bit longer. We're seeing some more delays at the end of the quarter, both with the net new deals, incremental deals and cloud migrations. I think companies, buyers are getting more skittish, which is why we just need to be thoughtful about what we expect in terms of growth but also in terms of our cost structure. And the good thing is, we have long-standing, strong customers, a great cloud business now, and so we're built to weather any macroeconomic changes, volatility, et cetera. But I think it's reasonable to think that there maybe impacts over the course of the next year, and we just need to be thoughtful about how we grow our business and grow our cost.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Phong. Next question is for Michael. Any thoughts on diversifying your Bitcoin strategy given the industry dynamics, for example, a lot of miners are struggling. Could MicroStrategy opportunistically look for returns through getting into mining, or are there any potential ways to exploit current spot price weakness other than just accumulating more Bitcoin?\nMichael Saylor: When we started down this path, we are -- in the middle of this summer 2020, we announced we were going to consider all sorts of different treasury assets. We looked at equity. We looked at gold. We looked at any kind of crypto. We considered bonds. We considered any kind of property investment. We settled upon Bitcoin as the strongest crypto asset at the time, and we said that we thought it was digital gold. And we've stuck with that strategy throughout the last 2.5 years or so. And everything that has happened in the market so far, in my opinion, has strengthened the observation that Bitcoin is the strongest crypto asset. And in theory, the strongest form of property is a crypto gold that's constructed such that you can't make any more than 21 million gold bars and you can move it at the speed of light as many times as you want between all the computers on the planet. So what's happened over the last 24 months is, we're more certain than ever that, in fact, this is a strong $21 million capped asset. We've seen the growth and the maturation of the Lightning Network, which is which is causing us to conclude that, in fact, you are going to see billions of people able to move Bitcoin at the speed of light point-to-point between websites and computers and mobile phones. When we look at all the other investment options, and as people that follow me know, I've recorded hundreds of hours of analysis. I've recorded analysis on Bitcoin versus real estate property. We've analyzed Bitcoin versus gold. We've analyzed Bitcoin versus every other crypto asset. We've analyzed bitcoin versus bonds. We've looked at bitcoin versus equity, and we've looked at Bitcoin. We've considered all of those, and our concludes Bitcoin is the Apex property and there's nothing better. Everything else that we could invest in would be dilutive versus bitcoin.  With regard to strategies, like do we want to be in a bitcoin derivative strategy? Are we going to buy or do Bitcoin mining or buy bitcoin miners or are we going to sell or trade derivatives or do something? We had the ability to pledge our bitcoin to many of these wildcat crypto banks in return for yield. But our view was, the heretical risk of transferring ownership or custody of bitcoin was better than the yield. And so, we didn't do it and of course, what happened is they all failed. And so that was a good strategy.  We also considered other strategies. But at the end of the day, it doesn't make sense to take any inevitable risk with any of those strategies compared to just taking the risk-free return on the bitcoin. So, all of those other ideas complicate our strategy and create opacity and you end up just having this risk in your portfolio, you don't understand. So we don't wish to take on that risk and we don't wish to convey that risk to our shareholders either.  So our conclusion is that, the best strategy for us is long bitcoin, only bitcoin as a digital asset and to the degree that we're going to look for returns in excess of the bitcoin return, and we have achieved that, as you could see from our numbers over the last 2 years on the slide I showed. The way we're going to achieve performance better than Bitcoin is through intelligent leverage when we have the ability to either convert our cash flows into Bitcoin and we do generate cash flow or if we can issue debt or equity under terms that we believe are accretive to the shareholders.  And they don't introduce any undue risk or fragility to the balance sheet. So, I think you'll just see a very thoughtful execution of the levered long Bitcoin strategy. And we don't feel a need to reach for yield or try to juggle any other asset. We view that all these other strategies are dilutive to the Bitcoin strategy.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. Thanks, Michael. This brings us to the end of the time we had for today. So thank you, everyone, for your questions. This concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar. I will now turn the call over to Phong for closing remarks.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish, Andrew, Michael. I want to thank everyone for being with us today and we appreciate your support. We're as enthusiastic as ever about both of our strategies, our enterprise software strategy and our Bitcoin strategy, and we'll continue to execute on both in the coming quarter. I look forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks. And I wish you all happy holidays and thank you all.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and thank you to all of our shareholders that are with us here today. I would like to provide a performance review of the company's results since we adopted a Bitcoin strategy. And I'm delighted to report to all the shareholders that since MicroStrategy adopted the Bitcoin strategy on August 11, 2020, our stock has outperformed all of the major asset classes that we benchmark ourselves against. It has outperformed all big tech stocks, and we have outperformed all enterprise software stocks that we benchmark ourselves against. You can see from this chart, we are up as of 4:00 P.M. yesterday, October 31 we were up 116%, since we embarked on this strategy. And we -- I think the most important benchmark we compare ourselves against is Bitcoin itself. And Bitcoin in that same time period is up 72%. So we have managed by our strategy to capture all of the Bitcoin gains with a boost. Now if we compare the Bitcoin performance in that 2.25 years to other assets, the S&P is up 15%. So a diversified portfolio of really high-quality stocks are 15%. the NASDAQ is effectively zero percent. So there is no gain in the NASDAQ. Gold, and many of you have followed us in our journey will recall that -- when we started on this path, our number one question was, should we buy Bitcoin or should we buy gold. Gold is down 19%. In that same time period, the Bitcoin is up 116%. That makes sense to us. Gold is the hard money solution for the 19th century, and Bitcoin is the hard monetary asset for the 21st century. But I think it's auspicious that we see the market is agreeing with us after these 24 months or so, 26 months. The bond index, and that's really BOND, -- it's still -- it's long bonds, about 20-year duration bonds. They have lost 22% of their value in this time frame. So bonds are obviously not holding value in the interest rate environment we're struggling with, and they have limited upside generally. And of course, silver, which is sort of a weaker precious metal than gold is down 33%. So, I think, when you look at the story here, Bitcoin is winning, but MicroStrategy is winning even more than the Bitcoin right now because of our levered long Bitcoin strategy we pursued. We benchmark ourselves against big tech stocks, and of course, three of the most extraordinary stocks and companies in the modern era are Apple, Google and Microsoft. And of course, Apple is up 36%, about one-fourth of our performance results and our stock. Google was up 27%. Microsoft is only up 11%. So MicroStrategy stock is 10x. Microsoft, even though Microsoft, of course, is the most successful software company on the planet. The challenge with equities, as we all know, is that you have not just monetary risk due to macroeconomics, but you also have execution risk. And so -- and you have all sorts of other types of risks. So Amazon is down 35% because of their challenges, which I won't go into. Netflix is down 40%, and META Group Facebook is down 65%. So you can see, of course, this mix performance is probably what drives the 0% NASDAQ result. And if we look at the mega enterprise software stocks, of course, Oracle is the monster enterprise software copy, they're up 42%. It's very well run and very stable, but they don't have the benefits of a Bitcoin balance sheet. IBM stock up 14%, salesforce down 18%, S&P down 40%. So even though I think there's a lot of publicity about the volatility of Bitcoin and some of the non-cash charges we've taken, the real interesting story here is that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy is the winner against all of these other strategies over the last 2.25 years. We generally pick August 10, 2020, as that date to go back to because that was the date before we purchased $250 million worth of Bitcoin, and we announced a $250 million Dutch auction or share buyback. And so that was a pretty critical point in the history of the company. Before that date, we are operating the software business without any treasury strategy and we had our $500 million in cash invested in short-term treasuries zero to 12-month treasury bills. And our primary strategy was either to buy the stock back or invest in treasuries. And after that date, we had a Bitcoin strategy that was implemented on $250 million. And then we had to wait until the end of the Dutch auction around September 10th of 2020 before we knew what was going to happen next. And then we had $175 million, which we invested in Bitcoin, and we have continued with our consistent Bitcoin long strategy since. I'd like to talk a little bit about the macro environment. And so we'll switch off to the slide for a second. The most important thing that's happened in the past 12 months is the risk-free interest rate in the world, and I don't just mean the Western world, the entire world has gone from 12 basis points to 465 basis points. That's the one-year treasury rate on US treasuries. And that's an extraordinary climb. In the middle of 2018, the one-year rate was about 280 basis points. It coasted down to about 150 basis points in January of 2020. And then it nose dived to just a few basis points, five to 10 basis points in March of 2020. The risk-free rate was effectively nothing for the next 18 months. And then when the Central Bank began to perceive inflation as being the priority more so than economic stimulus, these interest rates start getting increased and they got increased at the most rapid rate in 40 years. So we find ourselves in a situation right now where for the last 12 months, the risk-free rates have increased by a factor of 50, financial assets have all suffered, and that means gold, equities, bonds, et cetera, and crypto assets and Bitcoin, so we're all living that. I don't have to tell you about that. I think you understand that. The important point right now is that, we're now at a seriously inverted yield curve. The three-month bond rate for treasuries is about 417 basis points and the 30-year treasury bond rate is 410 basis points. So in essence, you make more money buying a three-month bond and a 30-year bond. This is probably not sustainable for the long term.  The classic interpretation would be that the yield curve is pointing toward expectation of recession, and the reason the 30-year rate is higher than the 3-month rate is an expectation that eventually the Fed will begin to loosen monetary policy and lower rates. I would say you could almost say that, our monetary policy was kind of to devalue the currency, weaken the currency, if not crash the currency for the first year of the pandemic crisis and now the monetary policy is ripping the wings off the economy for the last year. And we see the wings starting to come off. All of the currencies in the world have been crashing against the dollar and created a massive macroeconomic headwind. The pound and the euro are off about 15% against the dollar in the last 12 months. Japanese yen is down about 23% that manifests itself in a couple of impacts.  One is for any company that's primarily US-based or USD based sees that it's struggling against these foreign currency headwinds and its revenues and its earnings. And MicroStrategy suffered from that this quarter. We're selling in yen and euros and pounds and those in euros and pounds are being devalued 15% to 23% in the last 12 months. So that's a bit of a headwind.  I'm pleased to say that I think our P&L has held up really well against that macroeconomic headwind and we're happy about that. I think the other implication is there's -- this is exporting inflation to the rest of the world. So, commodities are priced in dollars like oil and so as the euro and the pound and the yen weakened, the cost to buy oil in those nations explodes and so we're seeing double-digit inflation throughout Europe, throughout the rest of the world. This is creating protests, social unrest, there are riots in some \u2013 in streets in Eastern Europe.  This is also creating a crisis amongst a number of conventional institutional investors. We just saw this manifest itself in the crisis in the UK, that resulted in the early resignation of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. That happened when they attempted to lower taxes, it created a crisis of confidence in the markets and a 30 and 40-year British pound bond rates exploded into the 505 handle range the markets aren't really holding 5% to 6% interest rates very well. When that happens, that creates a margin call on anyone that's using those instruments is their primary treasury reserve asset.  And \u2013 so the result is the markets hiccup and they reached and the entire government collapsed in the UK. I think that that's a warning sign. We can see that challenge. We can see in Japan right now, they've had to intervene to support the yen, which has also been collapsing and there's very explicit intervention. This is being viewed, I think, in the United States, and the rest of the Western world. And the takeaway is we're just to the point where we're either going to rip the wings off the economy, if we keep raising interest rates much more, or if the interest rates get into the 5% to 6% zone, we're going to undermine the balance sheets of pension funds and other major investors. And this is on international global problem that results in a lot of pressure on central bankers to slow down the rate of interest rate increases. And we see that manifested with people coming on CNBC, pointing out that they have to slow this down. We see political pressure to taper. We see international pressure on the US government from all these other nation states that have their currencies crashing on the Federal Reserve to taper this rise. So we're approaching some sort of macroeconomic inflection point. It's not clear when we get there, but we know that when 30-year bonds and 40-year bonds or 5.5%, the entire government of the U.K. collapses. And we know that the Japanese yen is now laboring because they're trying to hold a 10-year rate of 25 basis points in Japan, while the US 10-year rates served with a four handle. All of these things are suggesting that the current trend of continuing to raise the risk-free rate can't continue too much longer, the resistance of the tightening is increasing. And that takes me to just a discussion of the Bitcoin strategy right now and fundamentals. I think the summer here is over the last 12 weeks, the Bitcoin fundamentals have improved. As Andrew pointed out, volatility of bitcoin shifted for being more volatile than NASDAQ and highly correlated to being less volatile than NASDAQ and not so much correlated in the past three months. That's really bullish, I think, for the asset class and auspicious. The other fundamental developments are auspicious. BNY Mellon officially announced its Bitcoin custody services. That's very auspicious because that's probably the first major bank that stepped up into that business. Block upgraded Cash App and Cash up is a 40 million user type mobile application, and they upgraded it in their support of Lightning. So now they can send and receive lightning to Cash App mobile application instances. And they did it with a universal barcode. And so that means that I can hold the barcode up on my phone, and you can scan it, and it will either send a Bitcoin on the base layer, the Layer 1, if that's what you requested or it will send it on the Lightning layer. We're already seeing this create a massive amount of enthusiasm in the Lightning development community. It's launched a lot more lightning wallets. It's launched a lot more vendor interest in taking Bitcoin as lightening payments. And One of the more interesting stories right now is a supermarket chain call Pick-N-Pay, all around South Africa. Pick-N-Pay rolled out Lightning payments to 40 of their stores in production as the second stage of their Bitcoin adoption. And that appears to have been successful. There are a lot of videos circulating around and people going in and paying in a matter of seconds via Lightning transactions off of Android and iPhones, but the more important point is that their stated plan is to deploy Bitcoin Lightning support to 1,628 stores. So the broad-based adoption of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange via Lightning technology is now being taken seriously with the Cash App example, with the Pick-N-Pay example. This is getting a lot of attention in the community. And of course, the benefit to the retailer would be not only is it almost no fee, but it's also instant settlement. And it also appeals to the crypto friendly. And right now, across South America and Africa, people are becoming much, much more interested in the entire crypto area and Bitcoin, in particular, because the currencies are crashing. The Nigerian Niara has an official exchange rate in the 400 range. But it's government managed and the actual exchange rate is crashing to 800 to the $1, and they're announcing they're going to swap out the currency for a different currency. So what you see is you see a wholesale currency crashes, devaluations and bank failures and capital controls are spreading like wildfire throughout Asia, South America and Africa. And the solution to the population is a $50 Android phone running a mobile wallet like the Lightning wallet. And of course, this becomes a matter of great passion to them. And of course, it also becomes a matter of passion to the merchants because if the merchants can't get paid in hard currency, and they have to go through multiple layers of credit, then their businesses are also at risk. So that's a great fundamental development to Bitcoin, because traditionally, the view of Bitcoin is it's just a store of value because it runs on a Level 1 transaction network with only seven transactions a second. But now that people are saying that it's infinitely scalable over the Lightning Network, it's not just the store value. It's a game-changing technology that you can build into a mobile app on billions and billions of mobile devices. And so this is becoming very, very interesting and it's changing the narrative with regard to Bitcoin. Another big development that happened this quarter is FASB made the fair value decision by a vote of seven to zero. It doesn't mean that we have enough guidance to change our accounting. But -- but if we consider what happens next, we know we have unanimous support to adopt fair value accounting for Bitcoin. The next thing will have to be some guidance around and decisions around what the disclosure forms will be -- after that, there will have to be guidance about the transition plan, then they'll need some public commentary. And after they've internalized or absorbed all the public comments on the transition plan and the guidance, then I think that we'll see \u2013 we will see companies like MicroStrategy and anyone holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet, adopt fair value accounting, and that will be a huge benefit to the asset class. Bitcoin benefited by a few other things this quarter. First of all, noted recognition by the heads of the CFTC and the SEC. They both mentioned Bitcoin favorably and noted it to be a commodity. And so this is -- this was very auspicious and this has been noticed by the entire crypto industry and by the mainstream investment community. I think there's been an increase in DeFi hacks in the crypto industry this quarter. But that actually is just underscored how much more secure Bitcoin is and why Bitcoin is the institutional safe haven investment-grade asset, because in the same quarter where there are lots of DeFi hacks and crypto hacks, people are reminded again that there are no Bitcoin hacks and there have been no Bitcoin hacks. And that's a comforting differentiator. There's been an increase in SEC crypto enforcement actions, and this is serving to educate an entire generation of crypto investors as to the difference between a commodity and security. And I think that as people become educated as to the difference, they realize that there's a great benefit to holding a commodity and Bitcoin is the only crypto asset universally acknowledged to be a commodity. And so I think that the world is getting educated there. And then last point I'll make is that the Bitcoin hash rate is hitting an all-time high right now, and there are notes that people suggesting they see a touching 300 exahashes. So throughout the crypto winter and all the volatility, the Bitcoin hash rate has continued to expand. And people often ask, well, what is Bitcoin back by. It's backed by the most powerful crypto computing network in the world, which is also the most powerful computing network on earth, like so powerful that it's orders of magnitude more powerful than the hash rate that could be generated by all of the Microsoft, Amazon, and Google cloud computing hardware, if it were all turned against the network. So the fact that the Bitcoin has this wall of crypto energy, 300 exahash of it makes the entire asset censorship resistant, hack resistant. It gives it integrity. It gives a longevity. It makes it neutral. And ultimately, it provides the security that you need if you're going to put large amounts of monetary energy or wealth into Bitcoin. So oftentimes, people are spreading FUD, and their FUD will be something like well, the transaction rates will decrease and that will cause the security budget to go to zero, or if the price goes down, people will stop expanding the network. What we can see right now is that the Bitcoin network is adding additional security and the capital that gets invested in the security has about a six to eight-year delay versus when people made the decision. So the natural frequency of the Bitcoin network is eight years, eight years after a disaster catastrophe, you will start to see some mitigating effect, perhaps the hash rate will slightly slow down in its growth rate. But what we can see here is that people are adding, hashing equipment, Bitcoin mining equipment now that was purchased two years ago to the network. And so this is a very good thing for a crypto commodity. And what we see is Bitcoin performing just as you would expect it to perform, you know, as the most anti-fragile digital asset in the world. So with that, I'd like to thank everybody for your time and attention. I guess, Shirish, we're ready for questions I think Bitcoin's continue to strengthen for the past quarter against the broader crypto space. I think the market is getting more educated institutional investors are getting more educated. I think there is the momentum on the technology side is lurching away from the other cryptos toward Bitcoin. There's real explosion and enthusiasm in the Lightning community, and there are a lot of Lightning start-ups, Lightening incubators, there's more venture capital starting to look at lightening in particular. So I think Bitcoin's technology story is improving. I think it's \u2013 and I think the story is an asset is also improving. We've got surveys that just came out from Fidelity and gray scale that that show remarkable enthusiasm and interest among institutional investors for bitcoin and an expectation that, it will be part of their portfolio going forward, and those numbers have never been higher. I think we're going to start to see more companies building it into their 401(k). There's like a 12-month delay there, but I think that integrating Bitcoin into traditional finance and traditional investment products is one. I think in time, we'll see a spot Bitcoin ETF and more ETFs and it will be built into more financial adviser type programs. That's the second. I think you start to see more large banks similar to BNY Mellon starting to offer crypto custody services. And either Bitcoin trading or Bitcoin custody or Bitcoin-backed loans. So as the traditional banking establishment embraces Bitcoin, I think that's going to be another milestone. I think we can see with the FASB process. They began to look at this in late 2020, mid-2021, and probably it will be late 2023, it will be fiscal year 2024 when the financial or accounting changes take place. So there tends to be a two to four year delay in all of the institutional adoption of regulators, but once the momentum gets going, it continues. So the supportive actions of the CFTC and the supportive actions of the SEC and the supportive actions that have taken place at FASB will drive more supportive actions across the other regulatory agencies. I would expect when you start to see concrete guidance from the FDIC that will be another big milestone. And of course, we have a number of bills in Congress right now that would provide regulatory frameworks that would accelerate the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. I don't know of any legislation that would be viewed as negative for the asset class. So any of this work that's being done should be positive for the asset class. And so all of those are the fundamental milestones. I think we keep our eye on. And of course, ultimately, the macroeconomic wind has a big impact. So when the wind is to our back, it's beneficial to the asset class when the wind is to your face and blowing at you, it's more of a challenge. But over time, these things go full circle. When we started down this path, we are -- in the middle of this summer 2020, we announced we were going to consider all sorts of different treasury assets. We looked at equity. We looked at gold. We looked at any kind of crypto. We considered bonds. We considered any kind of property investment.

With regard to strategies, like do we want to be in a bitcoin derivative strategy?

We had the ability to pledge our bitcoin to many of these wildcat crypto banks in return for yield. But our view was, the heretical risk of transferring ownership or custody of bitcoin was better than the yield. And so, we didn't do it and of course, what happened is they all failed.

            "content": "Thank you, Phong. I'll start by highlighting our third quarter 2022 financial results in more detail. GAAP total revenues for the quarter were $125.4 million, down $2.6 million or 2% year-over-year. Isolating the impacts on foreign exchange, total revenue was up 4% year-over-year at constant currency. Total software license revenues, which is a total of product license revenues and subscription services revenues were $38.7 million, up 5% year-over-year, and up double digits or 11% at constant currency. As we continue to migrate our customers to the cloud, we know that product licenses revenues will naturally decline as revenues previously recognized upfront are converted to revenues recognized over a longer period as subscription services revenues. When we look at the two together, year-over-year increases on both a GAAP basis and at constant currency are positive indicators that we are successfully moving our customers to the cloud not only on a stand-alone basis, but as well as contributing to the overall growth of our software platform. In line with what I just described, subscription services revenues were $16.4 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year and up 59% at constant currency. Product licenses revenues were $22.3 million for the quarter, which was $3.5 million lower year-over-year, while product support revenues were $66 million, down $4.4 million year-over-year, relatively flat at constant currency. As Phong mentioned earlier, our Q3 renewal rate was again at 95% this past quarter, demonstrating the durability of our platform and the long-standing nature of our customer base. Finally, other services revenue, which primarily reflects our consulting business was $20.7 million, a slight decrease year-over-year but a 7% increase in constant currency. Our highly skilled and experienced consultants continue to support, innovate and modernize our platform across our customer base. And we have been very successful in delivering consulting services across our global delivery centers in the US, Europe, South America and Asia, while optimizing costs and increasing billable hours year-over-year. Moving to billings. Our total current software license billings were $36.4 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year, and in the third quarter, subscription -- current subscription billings were $14.4 million, an increase of 79% year-over-year. This is in comparison to the increase of 51% year-over-year in Q2. This sequential growth was driven by solid results in both subscription services revenues, as well as current deferred subscription services revenues. It is also worth noting again that we sold our largest cloud billings as multiyear contracts with an average term of over 24 months, of which only 12 months are currently reflected on our balance sheet. We believe our cloud transition is successfully underway, and the demand from our customers to migrate MicroStrategy to the cloud remains very strong with additional pipeline being added from both our domestic and international customers. Shifting to costs. Total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude share-based compensation costs were $102 million in the third quarter, compared to $165 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our total non-GAAP costs this quarter were significantly lower year-over-year, as well as compared to Q2 of this year. This was primarily due to stable Bitcoin prices this quarter, which led to a nominal $700,000 Bitcoin impairment charge in contrast to the $65 million charge in Q3 of 2021. The Bitcoin volatility as measured by the one-month realized volatility fell below that, of the major equity indices such as the S&P 500 and NASDAQ this past quarter. We view this recent market shift as a possible signal that Bitcoin's investor base and institutional adoption is continuing to mature, making it more suitable and accepted by traditional market participants. During the quarter, Bitcoin prices remained above our carrying value, low watermark of approximately $17,600 \u2013 and as a result, we saw a minimal digital asset impairment charge in Q3. Non-GAAP cost of revenues were $24 million in the third quarter, an increase of $2.6 million or 12% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP cost of revenues was up 2% year-over-year attributed to higher cloud hosting fees and investments in technology and talent as we continue to scale up to support our growth in cloud. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $30 million, which was a decrease of $4.1 million or 12% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP sales and marketing costs were lower by 3%, and year-over-year, primarily due to higher net capitalized commissions this quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $27 million, an increase of $1.4 million or 6% year-over-year. We continue to prioritize research and development in our core software business as we invest in personnel supporting innovation, cybersecurity and growth in cloud. Non-GAAP G&A costs were $20 million, which was an increase of $1.4 million or 7% year-over-year. As we emphasized earlier, the uncertain macroeconomic environment and inflationary trends continue to present headwinds to our bottom line, and we believe these challenges are the new normal. Although, we see strong growth in cloud and high sustained renewal rates, managing rising costs is critical to weathering the current environment. We plan to be extremely disciplined in controlling costs in the near term as we navigate these conditions, and we will continue to cut costs in certain areas, while prioritizing spend that we believe will drive revenue growth. On slide 13, total non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $23 million, reflecting a non-GAAP margin of 18%. The very small Bitcoin impairment charge this past quarter that I mentioned earlier had a minimal impact on our reported results and was the lowest digital asset impairment charge since we launched our Bitcoin strategy in Q3 of 2020. In a reporting period, where there are minimal impairment charges under the current accounting rules, we believe our non-GAAP operating income better represents the underlying performance of our core software business. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2 billion, which reflects approximately $2 billion in cumulative impairment charges incurred through the end of Q3. As you know, GAAP accounting treats our Bitcoin holdings as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, which means that any decrease in the fair value below our carrying value any time after date of acquisition requires us to recognize an impairment. Conversely, when prices increase, the current accounting rules did not allow us to increase the carrying value. On October 12, the Financial Accounting Standards Board unanimously voted to recommend the adoption of fair value accounting for all public and private companies in measuring certain digital assets, including Bitcoin. Under current fair value accounting standards, both decreases and increases in the fair market value of an asset would be recognized in GAAP earnings. We understand this is an initial step in the standard-setting process and many of the details and disclosures have yet to be determined, but we are extremely encouraged and supportive of the FASB's decision for the change and the improved investor transparency it should provide. We believe this is an extremely positive step for the future of digital asset accounting, and we remain committed as we have in the past to supporting these efforts. Turning to Slide 15. Our debt capital structure consists of a $500 million senior secured note, a $205 million Bitcoin back loan and $1.7 billion of convertible senior notes, all with a blended interest rate of approximately 2%, the earliest maturity, which is not until March 2025. We have also issued $1 billion of equity through previously announced At The Market or ATM offering in Q3 and Q4 of 2021. Recently, on September 9, we filed a prospectus supplement for an additional ATM equity offering, which will allow us to sell up to $500 million of Class A common shares from time to time into the market. As of October 31, 2022, we have not sold any shares under this program. We intend to use the ATM under a disciplined approach to sell equity, if and when we believe there is an embedded value premium in our stock, compared to the market value of our Bitcoin holdings and our estimated value of our enterprise analytics software business. The use of proceeds will be for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin. Our focus is in managing capital will continue to be that of accreting shareholder value, optimizing our overall capital structure and ensuring adequate liquidity to run our operations and service our debt. On Slide 16, as of September 30, 2022, we held a total of 130,000 Bitcoins, of which 14,890 Bitcoins were held directly by MicroStrategy at the parent. All of which secure our 2028 notes. The remaining 115,110 Bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy -- I'm sorry, MacroStrategy, our subsidiary. In Q3, there was no change to the number of Bitcoins pledged at MacroStrategy. Of the Bitcoins held at the sub, approximately 30,000 Bitcoins are pledged as collateral to our Bitcoin back loan and just over 85,000 Bitcoins or 65% of our total holdings, equivalent to approximately $1.7 billion at the current market price of $20,400 remain unpledged and unencumbered. As you can see, we have more than sufficient collateral to meet the ongoing requirements of our Bitcoin back loan today and through any current foreseeable price volatility. As Paul mentioned earlier, our Bitcoin strategy remains simple. We have bought and held Bitcoin and will continue to do so. Finally, before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to reemphasize that MicroStrategy's principal core strategies are to operate and grow our enterprise analytics business and to acquire and hold Bitcoin as a treasury reserve for the long-term. This hybrid strategy represents a paradigm shift where we seek to maximize the performance of both segments of our business, while identifying and capitalizing on the synergies that come from combining a mature and profitable enterprise software business with a large-scale digital asset holding. Thank you for your time today and for your support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Thanks, Shirish. I'll take -- I can start with the first part of that question. I'd say wage inflation for us has been pretty consistent with the overall market. And I'd say that -- it's probably been the most competitive leading up to Q3. I feel like we're seeing competition for talent slow a with general recession fears and cost cutting in the overall technology sector in more recent months. I think we have used stock-based comp across our departments and geographies, which has definitely been a useful tool in retaining talent. I think the last thing I'd say, too, is just keeping in mind that MicroStrategy's talent base across the entire organization, including a very critical role such as in sales and in tech are extremely tenured and our attrition rates are trending, I'd say, lower than our internal targets in recent months. Thanks, Shirish. I think the short answer is we consider all of the above. We have demonstrated that when we have excess cash from operations in any given quarter, those excess proceeds can be used to buy Bitcoin. We've done that in the past few quarters. As well as proceeds from larger capital markets activities, I think you can continue to expect the same pretty simple strategy going forward. In terms of potential more severe macro downturn, I think we do not have any plans to adjust our Bitcoin strategy. We do, as we always have viewed our investment as a long-term view, importantly, through cycles, including the one we're in now, and we will continue to believe in that core principle."

            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2022 third quarter financial results. First, I will focus on the 2022 third quarter business results. We had another good quarter overall, achieving constant currency total revenue growth on the strength of our cloud business. This, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment in Q3 with continuing high inflation, weakening foreign currencies in the ongoing war in Ukraine. We had strong growth in our subscription revenue and billings driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer revenue renewal rates continue to be amongst the highest we've ever experienced. To summarize our third quarter software results, revenues increased 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total software licenses revenue, which consists of product -- total product licenses and subscription services revenues in our consolidated statement of operations increased 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We benefited from the increased adoption of our cloud platform, partially offset by a decrease in product license revenues. Over time, we expect our revenue profile to continue to shift towards recurring subscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased 59% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Current subscription billings grew 79% year-over-year, our 10th straight quarter of double-digit growth and our best quarter ever. We've also seen further global adoption of our cloud platform among our international customers, including customers in the Asia Pacific region, with several major wins in Q3. We've also seen further growth of our embedded business with multiple new logos. Next, I'd like to provide some observations from my first 90 days of being the CEO of MicroStrategy. I spent more time in the field in the US and internationally, listening to our customers and employees and learning from them. What I learned first is that our customers continue to love our product offerings. There are people that have built their careers on the MicroStrategy platform and dedicated to our success and see us rising above the fray of basic visualization tools. They're also excited about modernizing, consolidating their BI platforms in an open multi-cloud environment.  Accordingly, we'll continue to focus on three key areas of growth that represent core MicroStrategy differentiators, enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and the cloud. Our customers depend on these differentiating capabilities to build mission-critical applications to run their field forces, store operations, bank branches, risk analysis groups, corporate operations and much more.  I'll also focus more on innovation. Our continued investment in research and development has enabled us to modernize our platform and enable our customers to transform how they do business through innovative analytics, tools and techniques. These include personalized applications, immersive interactive visualizations, simple no-code and low-code application development with open APIs, flexibility of consumption for mobile interfaces and innovative capabilities like HyperIntelligence.  We continue to see growth from customers who build MicroStrategy into the software solutions that they sell to end users, leveraging our open embedded analytics capabilities. Looking forward, we recognize the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to augment more traditional reporting capabilities and provide contextual and immediate insights.  In Q3, we released our first set of products in this area called MicroStrategy Insights. This is the basis on which we are combining MicroStrategy Semantic layer, Hyper intelligence and open architecture to provide the data tracking, alerts, forecasting, recommendations and artificial intelligence that will be key for the future of analytics and intelligence. We believe this is something MicroStrategy is uniquely positioned to provide, and we expect to release more functionality in this area every quarter.  Another interesting area where we can differentiate our offerings is Bitcoin Lightning software development for the enterprise. We are in the initial stage of exploring innovative lightning applications for cybersecurity use cases to help enterprise customers through networks, monetize websites and deploy wallets in mass using Bitcoin. While our core focus remains on BI innovation, we believe we are uniquely positioned to bring value in this area also. Mike will elaborate further on this topic.  As MicroStrategy Cloud continues to be a growing part of our business mix. we seek to accelerate growth through increased cloud adoption by both new and existing customers. New customers are increasingly cloud-first and immediately reap the benefits of our managed service offering. Those include business agility, enterprise security, regular updates and upgrades and cost savings. At the same time, more and more existing on-premise customers are migrating to the cloud and expanding their MicroStrategy usage to new departments and user groups. Intentional in our approach to cloud is our belief in cloud agility. The power of multi-cloud, hybrid and the portability between private and public clouds resonates with our customers who do not want to be locked into a single technology stack. We take advantage of the best that each major cloud provider has to offer, optimizing our platform to run on and across each. We will continue to invest in this area to support our customers' needs for flexibility, scalability and security. We're eagerly awaiting final authorization to operate for the launch of MicroStrategy Cloud for government, our new cloud offering with FedRAMP authorization. This product will be our first generally available release of our cloud platform that relies on a modern cloud native architecture, utilizing containers and microservices. It will open up the possibility of migrating a large part of our business, Federal Government customers to the cloud. It also serves as proof of our enterprise-grade security, stability and scalability via certifications for large enterprises, previously reluctant to move to the cloud like those in the financial services industry. The combination of FedRAMP authorization, enterprise-grade capabilities and managed service delivery will help us further differentiate our solutions with government customers, our enterprises and embedded analytics customers worldwide. Our focus on enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and cloud services has resulted in more customers choosing to decommission and consolidate legacy platforms in favor of an enterprise-wide adoption of MicroStrategy. This has led to increasing revenue renewal rates every year in the last three years. Another observation for my time meeting customers is their willingness and desire for hybrid interactions that includes meaningful rich in-person connections alongside virtual meetings. Accordingly, I'm thrilled to share that our next MicroStrategy world will be back in person. From May 1 to 4 in Orlando, Florida. World23 will be a working event designed to help modernize analytics for innovative organizations looking to transform with data. We decided to showcase some of the world's best brands use modern experiences to break through and achieve extraordinary results. The conference will also include dedicated networking opportunities, workshops and training as well as our third annual Bitcoin for Corporations event. Registration is opened November 8, and additional details can be found on our Event website at microstrategy.com/world23. Turning to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. We continue the commitment to our strategy in Q3 and purchased 301 additional Bitcoins for approximately $6 million at an average purchase price of $19,000 \u2013 $19,860 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. We have not sold any Bitcoin to date. To reiterate our strategy, we seek to acquire and hold Bitcoin for the long-term. And we do not currently plan to engage in sales of Bitcoin. We have a long-term time horizon and the core business is not impacted by the near-term Bitcoin price fluctuations. As a final comment, I would say macro and market volatility are expected to be the new normal. We believe change is constant. In this world, businesses need actionable data, enterprise-grade analytics, multi-cloud capabilities and open architecture and customer success focus. MicroStrategy delivers this. Our competition prefers dashboard proliferation, departmental visualizations, single stack vendor lock-in and price increases. This market volatility may impact our financial results in the short-term, as we target modest constant currency revenue growth during our cloud transition. This will require us to be financially prudent, investing our platform, while applying a thoughtful approach to costs with the objective of remaining at least margin neutral in the short-term. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew, to discuss our financial results for the quarter in further detail. Thanks, Shirish. Yeah. When I mentioned we did well in the Asia Pacific region. It was related to cloud, and primarily because cloud adoption started in the US. I think over the last year, we've seen it start to grow quite a bit in the European region and Latin America. And most recently, we saw it start to grow in APAC. So that was notable just because we're seeing global adoption of cloud. As far as overall, if you look at our results, I still think macroeconomic impacts, geopolitical challenges, Ukraine war has an outsized impact on Europe. So we're seeing a little bit of a challenge there compared to the rest of the world. And that's probably the only thing I would note geographically that we're seeing right now. Yeah, you know, as I mentioned earlier, what I am seeing is a consolidation of I spend around the world, especially on to enterprise providers like ourselves. So less experimental tools, more and less departmental tools, more enterprise tools. So I am seeing -- and we are seeing customers reinforce their commitment to MicroStrategy over time, which has been a positive thing, and that manifests itself both in terms of renewal rates, but also in terms of customers migrating to cloud with us. Migrating to cloud is just another reinforcement and their belief in MicroStrategy and what we have to offer. So that our cloud subs billing was the strongest we ever had. I think part of that is because of the strength of our platform and all the investments we're making into R&D, and what I consider to be the right places that our customers care about. And the only thing I'd add is wage inflation is real. Competition for talent is real. It's improved a little bit like Andrew said, we also have folks, especially in our technology teams have been with the company five, tens, fifteen 20 years are years and quite loyal. \u2013 and we like to return that loyalty in terms of comp increases, stock-based comps. So I think we're doing the right things there. I do think, going forward, given macro factors, given volatility, we need to be pretty smart about how we manage, how many more people we add to the organization. So we'll be pretty smart about managing our costs or trying to keep our costs relatively flat \u2013 on headcount. It's just the right thing to do, prudent thing to do with our business right now. Yeah. It's similar to the renewal question. I do think vendors \u2013 do you think customers are reducing the number of vendors. So we're on average before COVID, a large enterprise might have 7 to 12 BI vendors. I think that number is cut in at least half \u2013 and again, that's generally a positive for us. So maybe their overall spend goes down, but their allocation towards MicroStrategy should increase over time. And that's the trend we're starting to see and a trend we hope to continue to see in the future. But we don't take for granted any of our customers, and we need to keep providing awesome product, awesome services, awesome support. I don't think the macro environment, as of now, is causing fewer deals or fewer cloud migrations. But I think it's reasonable to say that our deals are taking a little bit longer. We're seeing some more delays at the end of the quarter, both with the net new deals, incremental deals and cloud migrations. I think companies, buyers are getting more skittish, which is why we just need to be thoughtful about what we expect in terms of growth but also in terms of our cost structure. And the good thing is, we have long-standing, strong customers, a great cloud business now, and so we're built to weather any macroeconomic changes, volatility, et cetera. But I think it's reasonable to think that there maybe impacts over the course of the next year, and we just need to be thoughtful about how we grow our business and grow our cost. Thank you, Shirish, Andrew, Michael. I want to thank everyone for being with us today and we appreciate your support. We're as enthusiastic as ever about both of our strategies, our enterprise software strategy and our Bitcoin strategy, and we'll continue to execute on both in the coming quarter. I look forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks. And I wish you all happy holidays and thank you all."

I will be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website microstrategy.com. I would like to welcome you all to today's webinar and let you know that we will taking questions using the Q&A feature at the bottom of your screen. You can submit questions throughout the webinar, and Michael, Phong or Andrew will answer questions at the end of the session. Please be sure to provide your name and your company's name when submitting your questions. Now I will walk you through the agenda for today's call. First, Michael Saylor will provide a strategic review and discuss our recently announced executive transition. Second, Phong Le, we'll cover the operational results for second quarter 2022. Then Andrew Kang will cover the financial results for second quarter 2022. And lastly, we will open up to Q&A. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael Saylor, Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. Michael?\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Shirish. I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2022 second quarter financial results. First, I'd like to provide a strategic review. As you know, MicroStrategy has two corporate strategies. The first is to operate and grow our enterprise analytics business. The second is to acquire a whole Bitcoin. We've made great strides in both areas over the past two years. We've digitally transformed our sales, marketing and services. We've upgraded our enterprise BI platform and we've migrated many of our customers to our integrated cloud intelligence offering. We've also established a trusted network of digital asset service providers. We've developed a set of corporate procedures for acquiring and holding Bitcoin in custody and executed multiple equity debt and convertible debt offerings in order to expand our balance sheet. We are now the largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company, as well as the largest public holder of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy represents a new kind of firm. which generates cash flow based on enterprise software products and cloud intelligence services and has a balance sheet based on Bitcoin, a digital commodity that we believe is superior to traditional physical commodities, like energy, metals or agricultural products. This hybrid corporate strategy represents a paradigm shift. What started as a defensive strategy and intended to protect our balance sheet rapidly evolved into an opportunistic strategy as we sought to create shareholder value during the pandemic crisis. We no longer view Bitcoin acquisition is opportunistic. It is simply our second corporate strategy. Our future now depends on how we manage and develop our intellectual property, that is software, as well as how we manage and develop our digital property that is Bitcoin. I'd like to talk a bit about our performance in these two strategies. It's now over two years -- about two years since we embarked on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. And while I think a minimum holding period for a long-term investment would be four years, it seems fitting that we should do a midterm review of results so far. Since August 11, 2020, our stock has outperformed Bitcoin as well as every major asset class, along with every major big tech stock. Now why do we choose August 11, 2020? That was the day we announced our Bitcoin strategy, and we've coupled it with the Dutch auction where we offered to buy back $250 million of our shares. So we embarked upon this strategy on August 11. When we looked back at where did MicroStrategy close the day before? It's up 123% since we embarked on that strategy. Where is Bitcoin gone? Bitcoin is up 94% since we announced our Bitcoin strategy. So MicroStrategy has actually outperformed it quite. We've captured more than 100% of the alpha of Bitcoin. From a standing start, the S&P index is up 23% in that same time frame. NASDAQ is up 13%. So as you can see, we've outperformed by a factor of 10 NASDAQ stocks in general. We've outperformed the entire S&P by a factor of 5. The option that we had when we chose Bitcoin was gold. We said digital gold or gold. Gold is down 13% since that fateful day. So Bitcoin plus 94%, gold down minus 13%; MicroStrategy up 123%. We could have held our $500 million plus of treasury assets and bonds. And the conventional view is to hold bonds. Well, we could have held short-dated bonds that generated 0% interest or we could have bought midrange bonds. And if we look at the PIMCO BOND Index, B-O-N-D, that index is down 14% since August 11, 2020. And of course, for those who believe in silver instead of gold, silver is down 29%. So as you can see, when we're choosing a treasury reserve asset, Bitcoin outperformed all other reasonable treasury reserve assets. Now we actually considered MicroStrategy performance and Bitcoin's performance against big tech, too. For those of you who know me, you know I wrote the mobile wave and I've been a big advocate of big tech digital monopolies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook. You can see Google in this time period is up 54%. MicroStrategy more than doubled it. Apple, up 43%; Microsoft, up 34%. So we managed to beat those three digital monopolies. But the other interesting thing is that half of big tech is down in that same period. Amazon has lost 14% of its value, Meta Group or Facebook down 39%, and Netflix down 53%. So if we look at all these numbers, and if you recall, when we announced our strategy, we said we were considering all possible treasury reserve options. We managed to choose the single one, bitcoin that's plus 94% to beat everything. And MicroStrategy executed on that. We basically started by buying $250 million of bitcoin. We executed on that, so as to not just capture a fraction of the Bitcoin return, but actually more than 100% of the bitcoin return for our shareholders in that time period. During this period, we've successfully raised $2.4 billion in debt and $1 billion in equity. And we expanded our enterprise valuation from approximately $666 million to $5.6 billion, an increase of approximately $5 billion or over 730% in those two years. These results probably come as a surprise to many, since there's a tendency to focus on short-term volatility of bitcoin and its related impact on our share price. As a publicly traded operating business that holds digital property, MicroStrategy unlike any other enterprise software company. With our deep knowledge of business intelligence, rich enterprise analytics software platform and distributed network of loyal global providers -- sorry, loyal global customers providing us with a stream of revenues and cash flow, we're unlike any conventional holder of digital assets. That means we need to think differently about how we manage our firm and maximize shareholder value overtime. For an analyst, considering how to value a hybrid software digital asset firm such as MicroStrategy, it makes sense to consider the value of each of the components of the business and then calculate the sum of the parts. The software business can be valued as a revenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as a multiple of revenue or earnings with consideration given to the likely growth rate, the customer loyalty and the quality of those recurring revenues.  The digital asset business can be valued at net asset value with a premium based on an assessment of, A, the ability of the management team to execute effectively; and B, the prospects of the digital asset. Adopting this framework, we've organized our firm in order to maximize the performance of both elements of our business, while using finance to identify and capitalize on synergies that come from pairing, a stable enterprise software business with a large, potentially high-growth admittedly volatile digital asset holding. Now I'd like to talk about the outlook. We are still early in the adoption cycle of digital assets and Bitcoin in general. There is clearly a strong demand around the world for a number of things. First of all, A, a digital property to serve as a long-term store of value asset; B, a digital commodity to service a trading alternative to energy, metals and other physical commodities. C, a digital payments network that's open, neutral, fast and free for all to use. D, a digital currency that can serve as a medium of exchange for those unable to access dollars via the traditional banking system or for those who wish to trade at the speed of light, friction-free on mobile phones and websites. Stable coins like US DC are examples of such a currency. E, digital exchange that allows anyone to trade all currencies and all assets 24/7, 365. These five things are the clear innovations and there's extraordinary excitement and enthusiasm around those ideas. Global consensus has built over the past two years that the world would benefit from these technologies, and we need these digital assets to build the economy of the 21st century. Bitcoin serves as the ethical, technical and economic foundation of this emerging digital economy due to its macular conception, it's recognition as a commodity without an issuer, global brand recognition and worldwide network of mining operators with tens of billions in special purpose hardware and energy contracts that provide unmatched security and network integrity. The current wave of crypto rationalization, regulation and innovation is healthy for this industry over the mid and the long time frame. And we expect Bitcoin will be the prime beneficiary of all these trends. The demise of Celsius, Voyager and 3 eras has removed unhealthy business practices and dangerous leverage from the system, educating millions of market participants on the merits of holding an asset like Bitcoin without counterparty risk and taking self-custody or placing that asset in cold storage. Regulators have been catalyzed by the crypto market meltdown and accelerated plans for regulating exchanges, cryptosecurities and stable coins. We should see regulatory clarity come earlier than we would otherwise expected, and it is clear from communications, from Congress and regulatory bodies, the more focus is going to be placed on the digital assets industry and the rules and related initiatives will be fast tracked. Many large institutional investors have yet to make substantial allocations of capital to this new asset class because they're waiting for this regulatory clarity. So the focus that regulators are placing on the crypto industry is welcome news to us, and we believe a net positive for Bitcoin. Even while there is market turmoil, innovation and adoption continue in the digital asset space. The Bitcoin network has settled more than 17 trillion transactions this year, and the Lightning Network continues to expand at a rapid pace, reaching record levels of liquidity and scale each quarter. Every week, new banks announced Bitcoin custody services, no derivative products are coming to market, and new financial service providers continue to enter the space, offering trading, analysis and banking services to the swelling population of investors. The growing interest in Bitcoin from banks, such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Santander, as well as Fidelity's initiatives to offer 401(k) services that include Bitcoin are indicative of this trend. Macroeconomic trends continue to favor and drive the adoption of digital assets as well. In the past two years, numerous currencies in South America, Africa and Asia have collapsed. And even traditional strong economies are suffering from currency weakness. The Great British pound, the Korean won, the South African rand are all down 12% in the last 12 months. The euro is down 14% against the dollar. The Polish zloty and the Japanese yen are down 17% against the dollar, and the Turkish lira is down 54%. The strengthening dollar has created a demand around the world for digital currency. Since many people outside the US would prefer to trade their local currency for US dollars and many people outside the traditional banking system can install a digital bank on their mobile phone in a few minutes and enter the global economy using the US dollar as a medium of exchange and Bitcoin as a store of value. We believe that Bitcoin should be the primary beneficiary of these trends. Since it is still a small fraction of the market capitalization of gold commodities, property, currency, bonds and commercial real estate. Continued inflation will create a need for a non-sovereign store value asset that is neutral and globally available. Technology will make it easier and more functional to use, and ongoing education and regulation efforts will introduce more investors to this new asset class each year and make them more comfortable holding wealth in the form of digital property. MicroStrategy has ambitious plans to grow both parts of our business. There's a continuing need for enterprise analytics everywhere, and we are well-positioned to grow with our best-in-class integrated business intelligence platform. We expect to accelerate our transition to cloud-based intelligent services and exploit our increasing brand awareness and global reach to gain new customers and deepen our relationships with existing clients. We also have a unique opportunity to continue growing our Bitcoin holdings via more acquisitions financed by cash flows, debt, and equity. We're one of the few operating companies in the world that has the technical capability and the corporate mandate to acquire and own Bitcoin as well as issue Bitcoin-backed financings. We're also uniquely positioned to develop enterprise software that leverages the Bitcoin network. We expect more opportunities will come our way and we intend to be ready to take advantage of our leadership position in the bitcoin industry when the time is right. Given this dramatic increase in the scope of our ambitious plans and the scale of our balance sheet assets. We've decided that the firm would be best served by expanding and reorganizing the management team. Andrew Kang recently joined our team as Chief Financial Officer, assuming responsibilities that were previously handled by Phong Le. Many of you will be hearing from Andrew for the first time on our earnings review call today and we're delighted to have him aboard. For the past two years, Phong Le has served as our President and CFO. Now, we feel it is the right time to elevate him to the role of President and CEO responsible for all of our corporate operations. Phong's the ideal candidate to take the CEO role. He joined our firm in 2015 as CFO, progressively assuming responsibility for Human Resources, Facilities and Information Systems. And later expanded his scope to manage sales and services as our Chief Operating Officer. Two years ago, he assumed responsibility for Marketing and Technology as well when he was elevated to President. In all of these roles, he's been successful and he's gained the respect of the Board as well as the respect of our employees, customers, partners, and vendors. So, the progression to CEO is both natural and well-deserved. Phong will also join our Board of Directors as a member of the Board. I will assume a new full-time role as Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. I will remain an Executive Officer and Employee of the company and Chairman of the Board of Directors as well as assuming the role of Chair of our Investments Committee, where I will continue to provide oversight for our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. My focus will be on our corporate strategy, our innovation efforts, our Bitcoin strategy and related Bitcoin advocacy and education initiatives, such as my work with the Bitcoin Mining Council. I will continue to act as an enthusiastic spokesperson for MicroStrategy and as our envoy to the Global Bitcoin community. As global adoption of digital assets accelerates, this is becoming an ever more expansive job, and I'm comforted increasing the scope of my advocacy efforts knowing that the execution of the MicroStrategy business plan rests in the capable hands of Phong, Andrew and the rest of our executive team. These changes will take place as of August 8, 2022. At that time, the company will have a dedicated Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Kang; a dedicated President and CEO, Phong Le; and a dedicated Executive Chairman and myself. This represents a welcome strengthening of our management team as we prepare for the next phase of corporate growth at MicroStrategy. I'm personally excited about this news. The three of us make a great team. We work together well and possess mutually complementary skills and experience. This will be a benefit to our shareholders, customers, employees, partners as well as to the broader community as we continue to lead the way in Business Intelligence and Bitcoin corporate adoption. Now I would like to pass the floor to Phong Le, our President and soon-to-be CEO to provide an operational review of our business results.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Michael. I'm honored and looking forward to leading this truly innovative organization in my new role as President and CEO. MicroStrategy has founded 33 years ago as a technology innovator with a vision of intelligence everywhere. Since then, we've become a global leader in business intelligence serving the largest, most respected enterprises and government organizations in the world. We've also been a technology pioneer in the fields of relational, web, mobile and cloud analytics. Our employees and executives are the foundation upon which our strength in enterprise analytics was built, and I'm enthusiastic to work with them to continue to grow this business going forward. More recently, MicroStrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of corporation's treasury policy. We believe it's still early and further adoption of Bitcoin globally can have a positive effect on the Bitcoin price, which has the potential to offer upside to our shareholders. Bitcoin is the right long-term store value for MicroStrategy, enterprises, institutions, individuals and the world. Our history of innovation has allowed MicroStrategy to be successful for a sustained period of time. I plan to continue to build a culture and a company where innovation thrives. In addition, our ecosystem of customers, partners, shareholders and employees are essential to our success. Our commitment and focus on this group will strengthen under my leadership. I look forward to leading the organization for the long-term health and growth of our enterprise software and Bitcoin acquisition strategies. I'd also like to thank Michael Saylor. Following Mike's footsteps, our founder and a pioneer in enterprise analytics Bitcoin for institutions and CEO of MicroStrategy for 33 years is a great honor and a great responsibility. I've learned a tremendous amount for Mike over the last seven years, and I'm honored to build upon his foundation at MicroStrategy. I look forward to continuing to work with him in my new role as President and Chief Executive Officer; and as a member of the Board and his new role as Executive Chairman. I'll now focus on the Q2 2022 business results. Overall, we are pleased with our results in Q2. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment due to high inflation, weakening foreign currencies and the ongoing war in Ukraine, we achieved total revenue growth at constant currency on the strength of our cloud business. We had strong growth in our subscription revenue and billings driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer revenue renewal rates continue to be among the highest we've ever experienced. To summarize our second quarter software results. Revenues increased 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total software license revenues, which we consider to consist of total product licenses and subscription services revenues and our consolidated statement of operations increased 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We benefited from the increased adoption of our cloud platform, partially offset by a decrease in product license revenues. Over time, we expect our revenue profile to continue to shift towards recurring subscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased 40% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Current subscription billings grew 51% year-over-year, our ninth straight quarter of double-digit growth and our second best quarter ever. We're also seeing growing adoption of our cloud platform in our international customers with several major wins in Q2. We continue to focus on three key areas of growth that represent core MicroStrategy differentiators; enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and the cloud. Our customers depend on these differentiating capabilities to build mission-critical applications to run their field forces, store operations, risk analysis groups, corporate operations and much more. For our first growth area, I'm pleased to share the MicroStrategy ranked number one in the enterprise analytics use case in Gartner's 2022 Critical Capabilities report for the second year in a row. We found that during volatile economic times, organizations rely heavily on their analytics and look to enhance how they get that information in the hands of their end users effectively. The ability to deliver data analytics at scale with high performance and security remains a critical success factor for our thousands of customers worldwide. So we're proud to receive this designation once again. Moving on to enterprise analytics. We continue to see growth with customers who build MicroStrategy into the software solutions that they sell to end users, leveraging our open embedded analytics capabilities. Our focus on innovation and research and development has enabled us to continue to modernize our platform with improved immersive interactive user interfaces, simple no-code and low-code application development with open APIs and innovative capabilities like mobile and HyperIntelligence. Finally, as MicroStrategy Cloud continues to be a growing part of our business mix, we expect to accelerate growth through increased cloud adoption by both new and existing customers. New customers are increasingly cloud first and choose to deploy directly on MicroStrategy Cloud. At the same time, more and more existing on-premise customers are migrating to the cloud, and expanding their MicroStrategy usage to new departments and user groups. We also expect to launch in Q3 this year, MicroStrategy Cloud for government, our new cloud offering with FedRAMP authorization. This product is our first generally available release of our cloud platform that relies on a modern cloud-native architecture utilizing containers and microservices. It also continues to deliver the enterprise-grade security, stability and scalability that our customers have grown to expect. This combination of FedRAMP authorization, enterprise-grade capabilities and managed service delivery will help us further differentiate our solutions with government, large enterprises and embedded analytics customers worldwide. Our combined focus on enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and cloud services has resulted in more customers relying on us for an end-to-end business intelligence strategy. Off a decommissioning and consolidating legacy platforms in favor of an enterprise-wide adoption of MicroStrategy. This has led to increasing revenue renewal rates every year in the last three years. In summary, our outlook for the software business remains positive with our continued transition to cloud and our expectation of further increases in subscription billings. Overall, we're very pleased with the pace of product innovation. And we feel confident in our ability to achieve our long-term sales growth and profitability targets. Turning to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, we purchased 481 Bitcoins for $10 million in Q2, and an average purchase price of $20,790 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. We've not sold any Bitcoin to date. To reiterate, our strategy, we seek to acquire and hold Bitcoin long term, and we do not currently plan to engage in sales of Bitcoin. As of June 30, 2022, the company owned an aggregate of approximately 129,699 Bitcoins that we acquired for a total cost of $4 billion or $30,000 an 30,664 per bitcoin net of fees and expenses. We have a long-term time horizon and the core business is not impacted by the near-term price fluctuations of Bitcoin. As I mentioned earlier, we're a technology company with more than 30 years of history of innovation and are going to remain laser-focused on technology innovation. We prudently manage our capital allocation strategy and people strategy. As seen in the current markets, many software and crypto exposed companies have had to adjust a periods of rapid cost and headcount growth by rightsizing their teens or freezing hiring. In contrast, we have the benefit of a long history with our product and our customers, a stable, experienced executive team, and a long-term focus. We're in a strong position from a people and product perspective, and will strategically hire and invest in our people, while at the same time being cognizant of the current macroeconomic environment and careful in managing our costs. Finally, I'd like to introduce our CFO, Andrew King. He joined the company in May. I'm thrilled to see Andrew step into this critical leadership role, where he will be able to contribute from his 20-plus years of experience in banking finance, treasury and capital markets. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. I am delighted to be with everyone today and would like to start by turning to our second quarter 2022 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $122 million, down 3% year-over-year. While weakening foreign currencies impacted our revenues this quarter when isolating FX impacts, total revenue increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Total software license revenues, which consist of both product license revenues and subscription services revenues were in total $34 million, up 5% year-over-year or up 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The growth in total software license revenues this past quarter reflects our strategic focus on the migration of our platform to the cloud, which Phong highlighted earlier. In the second quarter, cloud subscription service revenues were $14 million, an increase of 36% year-over-year or up 40% on a constant currency basis. Total product license revenues were $20 million, a decrease of 9% year-over-year or a decrease of 6% on a constant currency basis. And product support revenues were $66.5 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year or 2% lower on a constant currency basis. Both product license and product support revenues are impacted when new and existing customers convert to our cloud model. And as a result, we expect those revenues to modestly decline alongside a corresponding increase in cloud subscription revenues and billings. It is important to note that even in light of this transition, our on-prem customers continue to reflect the durability of our business as demonstrated with a Q2 support renewal rate of 95% among the highest we've ever experienced. Finally, other services revenues, which largely reflect our consulting business, were $21.4 million this quarter, a decrease of 2% year-over-year but an increase of 4% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see positive trends in our consulting business through increased billable rates and our worldwide while optimizing costs through a global and highly skilled technology-consulting workforce. The 4% constant currency growth year-over-year is a strong indication of the desire from our customers to modernize and grow their deployment of MicroStrategy. Moving to billings. Our current total software license billings were $39.9 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the second quarter, current subscription billings were $20.1 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year, reflecting the same strong growth momentum we saw at the end of last year. This increase was driven by solid results in both subscription service revenues as well as current deferred subscription service revenues. Also worth noting, our largest cloud billings in Q2 were sold as multiyear contracts with an average term of over 24 months of which only 12 months are reflected on our balance sheet. We believe the demand to migrate MicroStrategy to the cloud remains very strong with additional pipeline being added from both our domestic and international customers. Shifting to costs. Total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude share-based comp, were $1.02 billion in the second quarter compared to $529 million in the second quarter of 2021. Aside from the bitcoin impairment expense that I will discuss in a moment, our costs this quarter reflect modest increase in areas specific to building out our cloud platform, retaining and attracting talent while focusing on efficiencies and corporate cost areas. Starting from the left of the chart, non-GAAP cost of revenues were $24 million in the second quarter of an increase of $1.6 million or 7% year-over-year. As a percentage of the total revenues, these costs, which are still scaling up to support the build-out of cloud reflect an increase of 2%, which was largely attributed to higher hosting fees and investments in technology talent. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $32 million, a decrease of $4.6 million or 13% year-over-year. As a percentage of total software license revenues, the second quarter decrease of 19% year-over-year continues to reflect improvements in the productivity of our sales and marketing teams, along with an increase in capitalized commissions compared to last year. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $29 million, which was an increase of $2.6 million or 10% year-over-year. This was an increase of 3% as a percentage of total revenues driven by the ongoing competitive environment for talent across the tech sector. We are anticipating that this trend will continue in the near term. However, as we prioritize overall spend in the second half and into next year, we will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in investing in R&D to attract and retain engineering talent and to drive innovation that creates demand for our products. Non-GAAP G&A expense was $22 million, an increase of $3.8 million or 20% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 3%. The overall macroeconomic environment and inflation challenges continue to create headwinds for our bottom line. The fact is, though, our business is operating well and our cost structure is stable. However, in the coming quarters, we will be intentional in prioritizing spend while focusing on areas that drive profitability, while continuing to promote a strong workplace culture. The largest non-GAAP expense for the quarter was the Bitcoin impairment charge of $918 million. You will recall that the GAAP treatment of Bitcoin impairment charges treats our Bitcoin holdings as indefinite wealth intangible assets under the applicable accounting rules, which means that any decrease in the fair value below our carrying value at any time subsequent to acquisition, requires us to recognize an impairment charge. Due to the bitcoin price volatility in Q2, the impairment on our Bitcoin holdings was measured against a low watermark Bitcoin price of approximately $17,600, if the future of Bitcoin prices remain above the low watermark, under the current accounting rules, we would not recognize any additional impairment against a substantial portion of our June 30, 2022 Bitcoin holdings.  On Slide 18, total non-GAAP operating loss in the second quarter of 2022 was $903 million, which includes the $918 million Bitcoin impairment charge I just spoke about. I'd like to highlight that since the adoption of our Bitcoin strategy in Q3 2020, the digital asset impairment charges we have incurred in every quarter since inception have always been greater than our non-GAAP operating losses. While our Bitcoin holdings are impaired when the price drops below the carrying value under current accounting rules, conversely, when the price increases, accounting rules do not allow the carrying value to be revised upward. We feel optimistic that the financial accounting standards board recently unanimously agreed to review the accounting rules for exchange-traded digital assets and commodities as part of their upcoming technical agenda, which could lead to a change in how digital assets are accounted for in the future. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2 billion, which reflects approximately $2 billion in cumulative impairment charges. As you can see in the chart, the market value of our Bitcoin holdings as of each quarter end has always been greater than the carrying value under the current rules. The capital markets have established us -- enabled us to be agile and access both the equity and debt markets in an efficient way to grow our enterprise value. As you can see on Slide 20, the earliest of our debt maturities are not due until March 2025 and the blended interest rate of our total $2.4 billion in debt is only 1.9%. As of quarter end, we had $69 million in cash on our balance sheet, and we expect cash flows from operations will be sufficient to cover our ongoing interest expense needs. Going forward, subject to market conditions, we will continue to evaluate opportunities that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders that further our Bitcoin strategy or optimize our existing capital structure. As of June 30, 2022, we held a total of 129,699 Bitcoins, of which 14,589 Bitcoins were held directly at MicroStrategy, the parent, all of which secure our 2028 notes. The remaining approximately 115,000 Bitcoins are held at our subsidiary macro strategy. Of the Bitcoins held at the sub, approximately 30,000 bitcoins are pledged as collateral to the Silvergate loan and just over 85,000 Bitcoins remain unpledged and available for use. These unencumbered Bitcoin is equivalent to approximately $2 billion, assuming a market price of about 23,000 per Bitcoins. Our Bitcoin strategy remains simple, buy and hold for the long term, and that is it. In Q2, the amount of Bitcoin pledge of macro strategy increased by 10,585 Bitcoins to support the Silvergate loan as Bitcoin prices fell to the Q2 lows. Our $205 million Bitcoin back loan requires us to maintain a loan-to-value or LTV of 50% or less, and we have the ability to contribute additional Bitcoin to meet the requirement as needed, which we did in Q2. If the price of Bitcoin appreciates and the LTV ratio is less than 25% at any time, we are also then able to withdraw any of the excess collateral at that time. With approximately 85,000 available unpledged Bitcoin, we have more than sufficient collateral to meet the ongoing requirements of the loan through any foreseeable price volatility. Finally, before I open up the call for Q&A, I would like to say that I'm extremely honored to be part of the MicroStrategy team and excited to be working with Mike and Phong in their new roles, where we are all aligned on executing on the corporate strategies of operating and growing our enterprise analytics business and acquiring and holding Bitcoin for the long-term. I believe MicroStrategy is truly in a category of one; having successfully combined a long-standing software business with a successful track record and deep customer base with a pioneering corporate treasury strategy to acquire Bitcoin as a store of value to become the largest corporate holder of the Bitcoin in the world. Thank you for your time today. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Shirish for Q&A\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Thank you, Andrew. We have received a lot of good questions, so we are going to jump right into the questions. The first question is for Michael. Is the CEO succession a recent development, or that is something that had been in works for a while?\nMichael Saylor: Okay. Can you hear me? Yes. The matter of CEO succession has been carefully considered and planned for at the Board level for many years. We believe in proactively developing our leadership team, and we realize the future of the firm is dependent upon our ability to cultivate successive generations of executives and promote from within. I had seven years of closely working with Phong on a day-to-day basis on IT projects, sales activities, on technology, on marketing, on services, on facilities, on finance initiatives. And the Board had seven years of experience with him because he was the CFO throughout that time, and he was closely involved with the Board every single quarter. When Phong was promoted to President of the company two years ago, I think it was pretty clear to company watchers that he was my era parent. So in summary, this is a decision seven years in the making when we finally got to the point that seemed right. It was an easy one to execute on.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. Next question is for Phong. What changes do you plan to make as a CEO?\nPhong Le: Well, I think Mike stated, we've been working together for seven years now in my capacity as CFO on and off, two years as President. I think we're fairly aligned in how to run both an enterprise software company and very aligned, working very closely together in the last two years in our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. So, I would sort of see this as a business-as-usual transition, where we get to even further clarify our roles in the organization, with our employees, with customers, with partners, with shareholders in the media, and I don't have any significant changes planned. Probably the biggest changes that we've observed is really Andrew's arrival two months ago and him now running the finance organization very credibly. And professionally, it gives me more time to run the company and gives Mike more time to focus on corporate strategy, innovation and the Bitcoin strategy.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Phong. Next question is for Andrew. Do you anticipate any further capital markets activity and what is your long-term debt strategy?\nAndrew Kang: Thank you for the question, Shirish. I believe the company has executed so far in a very prudent and well thought out capital structure framework. Really since 2020 and it has been extremely successful, as evidenced earlier, when Mike explained our stock performance over the last year compared to our comps. Our approach to debt or equity will remain the same as it has. We will continue to evaluate access to the markets that are most accretive, and we will look to obtain the most premium for dollars generated. That being said, right now in the current market, we are continuing to evaluate all the various opportunities and really have the luxury of continuing to be thoughtful on any future balance sheet execution. So, for the moment we're a bit of evaluate wait and see, but I can assure you that whatever we do in the future, we will continue to do so in a prudent and safe manner.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. Next question is for Phong. Phong congratulations on your promotion to CEO. Can you talk about your growth outlook for the software business for the second half of this year? There are significant macro crosswinds flowing, how do you expect this to impact the growth rate of your license and subscription billings in the second half?\nPhong Le: Thanks, Shirish. It's a good question. We were able to -- in my opinion withstand some of these macroeconomic challenges in the second quarter, as you saw, primarily by growing in the cloud. I think the second half, we'll see more macroeconomic changes, challenges, the strong dollar, unpredictability the War in Ukraine, etcetera. So, I think there will be more challenges. Our intent is to try to continue to grow. I think cloud will help us. As you all know, and as I and Andrew explained, growing in the cloud does have a short-term negative impact on product license revenue and also has a short-term negative impact on total revenue. So that will create probably more distraction in our revenues than the macroeconomic challenges. But I think we'll be able to continue to grow. I'm optimistic about it. That said, we're going to be prudent and thoughtful. We're not going to get out ahead of our skis on cost. And we'll see how the business continues. But things have been going fairly well when we see macroeconomic challenges, given our sort of -- given our strength in enterprise analytics and embedded analytics in the cloud and we'll be cautious but optimistic in the second half.\nShirish Jajodia: Next question is for Michael. Has the recent Bitcoin price volatility accompanied with large accounting adjustment impacted your view on your Bitcoin strategy going forward?\nMichael Saylor: Yes, it's a great question. We anticipated bitcoin volatility and we understood the accounting implications when we embarked on our Bitcoin strategy. I view both of these as competitive advantages for our firm. The volatility means that, A, bitcoin is more interesting than less volatile assets. And B, MicroStrategy is more interesting than companies holding less volatile assets. The phrase that comes to mind is volatility is vitality. We believe one of the reasons Bitcoin is the best-performing asset class of the last decade is because the volatility attracts interest, capital trading, it creates opportunities -- it's very special. Our firm visibility has been increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude since we embarked on our Bitcoin strategy. And interest in our securities has also increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.  We don't have to try to convince companies to want to cover our stock and explain why we're unique? They're hearing from lots and lots of other channels that were unique and the fact that Bitcoin is volatile means that, on the weekend, Bitcoin spikes up 20% or 10% then our stock might be mispriced and all of a sudden, there's someone that's thinking about it and obsessing about what to do on Monday morning and maybe the opposite. And the fact that they're obsessing means they have to discover us, and they notice us. And when they notice us, they started asking questions, what does MicroStrategy do? Oh, software, Tell me more about that. So, every CFO, CEO, CXOs, the C-suite, they've heard of us, the media they've heard of us. Traders have an economic incentive to invest in MicroStrategy. And I used to joke with people. If you like Bitcoin, then you'll like us. But if you hate Bitcoin, you'll still like us, because people that hate Bitcoin, they want to trade our stock and people do like Bitcoin want to trade our stock and everybody's got to have an opinion on it. So, the volatility just attracts attention and attracts capital, and it makes the company much more interesting. As for -- and the interest is important, because the thing you don't want is to be irrelevant to the world. When nobody knows you and nobody cares whether you succeed or don't, and no one knows what you do, that's the kiss of death. And so, our company has really emerged on this world scene, and it has helped us to sell to market, to recruit, to retain employees to find shareholders, et cetera. And so, I see those as all positives. I think the accounting treatment also benefits our firm, because we decided to adopt the Bitcoin standard. So, in an accounting treatment, that's indefinite and intangible, it's kind of challenging to be 3% committed or 2% committed or 18% committed. But when you're all in, all committed and people know they can multiply the price of bitcoin times 129,699 in any given day and then add in what they think the software business is worth, it actually -- it makes things easy, and we were able to do this because we launched that Dutch auction on August 11, 2020. Most other firms would find this a very daunting corporate transition and they wouldn't be able to sort of completely transform the corporate balance sheet with the support of the shareholders and the way that we did it with that transformational deal. So, as a result of that, because people are afraid of volatility and sometimes, they're off put by the accounting, we have been able to develop a lead in the digital asset space as the first and the largest public operating company on a Bitcoin standard, and I think that has given us a sustainable competitive edge and a differentiator that we can use to continue to build shareholder value going forward.\nShirish Jajodia: And Phong, would you like to add any further color?\nPhong Le: No, I think Mike said it very well.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. Next question is also for Michael. How should investors evaluate the new executive work structure? Are there any tangible benefits from it that will become evident over time, for example, a further development of the digital asset strategy beyond Bitcoin holding?\nMichael Saylor: Well, I think the executive structure is going to be a benefit to all of us. First of all, we're actually expanding the management team with the addition of Andrew. And that gives us a full-time finance executive, and as you know, our balance sheet has grown with our debt offerings and our ability to issue equity and the explosion of our enterprise value from $666 million to $5.5 billion, means that the finance function has become a full-time job in its own. And so Andrew has arrived and brought some new skills with him, but also Andrew has made it possible for us to promote Phong to President and Chief Executive Officer, and Phong is just an incredibly gifted operating executive and with the support of Andrew and with the CEO role and the unambiguous power that comes with it, Phong will be more effective and able to move more efficiently and drive the corporate mission. And I feel comfortable with Phong and Andrew in place as well as with the -- we haven't mentioned the rest of the executive team, but we have an awesome CXO team, right, our Head of Technology, our Head of IT, our Head of Consulting, our Head of Sales, right? And our Head of Marketing, they're the unsung heroes that aren't on this call right now. But that team is just very accomplished, very stable. And this new executive structure means that I can even more enthusiastically focus upon communications and strategy and Bitcoin advocacy and evangelism knowing that I'm not ignoring the nuts and bolts day-to-day operations of the business, of which there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100,000 things you have to do well every year in a software company, and they need to get done, and they will get done. But the world of Bitcoin is exploding. And everywhere in the world, people are interested in how they plug into this network, and how can MicroStrategy integrate with them? And so that's a job that's actually growing in scope. So I feel like I'll be more effective, Phong will be more effective. Andrew's welcome addition. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a win-win-win.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Michael. Next question is for Phong. Given the macroeconomic risk, can you update us on how you think about balancing revenue growth versus margin expansion?\nPhong Le: We're focused on growing the revenue. I think we have the right cost structure in place to do it. So I don't believe we need to sacrifice revenue growth by reducing if we were to reduce our costs, I think we can continue to grow at the current cost structure. And I think that will also start to result in margin expansion. So they're not direct trade-offs in my opinion.\nShirish Jajodia: Another one for Phong. So good to see growth in core software, can you give us an idea on where we stand now in mix between license and SaaS? When might we expect to see SaaS growth begin to move the growth needle more materially?\nPhong Le: Yeah. On a recognized revenue basis, our cloud subscription revenue is about 15% of our recurring revenue. On a billings basis, it's about 20%. So we haven't reached that an inflection point where our SaaS business gets to, I would say, north of 40%, whereas we continue to grow, it's fully accretive to revenue in the short-term. Right now it's accretive to revenue in the long-term, but not quite the short-term. So I think we have some time left. Obviously, all of you -- many of you have seen companies go from a perpetual license to a subscription revenue transition in the past. And I think you're familiar with that short-term dip in product license revenue and its impact on total revenue, and how that comes out on the other end with an acceleration of revenue. So we're going through right now -- there's high demand for cloud, which is exciting. Our customers understand the value proposition. Our marketers understand how to explain. Our salespeople understand how to sell it. And we are learning better-and-better how to operate at scale. So it's, I would say, full speed ahead with the cloud transition.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you. Next question is for Andrew. Would you like to elaborate further on managing expenses in the second half of 2022?\nAndrew Kang: Sure. I think tagging on to what Phong said earlier, our cost structure is very stable. And I think that's the benefit of being a long-standing company in business for over 30 years. And we haven't had this massive growth in head count. Head count has been very stable. We haven't over hired as we've seen many in the market do recently. So I think from a cost perspective, we will continue to focus on areas that are accretive to profitability. We'll look to be opportunistic where we can on bringing in new talent, in fact, around key areas like tech and cloud and sales. And we'll really scrutinize the other costs that we think we can be more efficient. And I've got the benefit of coming in and getting to ask a lot of new questions on certain expenses and costs. And so I think that will be helpful and understanding where we can be more efficient. But ultimately, I think we're going to be opportunistic and spend in areas that will help our business grow.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. We'll just take one last question for Phong here. On the demand environment, what are you seeing in the demand environment for BI software, on the uncertainty on macro? And what is your demand outlook for the rest of 2022? And have any deal cycles elongated, or any view from customers on their, spend?\nPhong Le: Yeah. Thanks, Shirish. I do think we're seeing choppier demand, elongated deal cycles more challenges in our selling environment, especially in international. All that said, as I mentioned before, if we can push through and execute, leverage our expertise in enterprise analytics, the fact that we build applications that large enterprises rely on, especially in turbulent times and leverage our cloud transition, I think we can work through this and grow in the second half and in the future. But there's certainly more volatility, we have to be better at execution. We have to be more precise in managing our pipeline, and our sales cycles, and our opportunities, and our customer engagements, and our conversations. So look, it requires better execution in these types of times. And this is what we're good at. We're a company that has great product, great strategy and great execution. So it's hard, but we'll work through it.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. So we are at the end of time for today's call. Thank you, everyone, for the questions. This concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar. I will now turn the call over to Michael for closing remarks.\nMichael Saylor: I want to thank everybody for your support, and Phong, Andrew, Shirish and I will all look forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks, and we wish you a happy summer. Have a good day.",

            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2022 second quarter financial results. First, I'd like to provide a strategic review. As you know, MicroStrategy has two corporate strategies. The first is to operate and grow our enterprise analytics business. The second is to acquire a whole Bitcoin. We've made great strides in both areas over the past two years. We've digitally transformed our sales, marketing and services. We've upgraded our enterprise BI platform and we've migrated many of our customers to our integrated cloud intelligence offering. We've also established a trusted network of digital asset service providers. We've developed a set of corporate procedures for acquiring and holding Bitcoin in custody and executed multiple equity debt and convertible debt offerings in order to expand our balance sheet. We are now the largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company, as well as the largest public holder of Bitcoin. MicroStrategy represents a new kind of firm. which generates cash flow based on enterprise software products and cloud intelligence services and has a balance sheet based on Bitcoin, a digital commodity that we believe is superior to traditional physical commodities, like energy, metals or agricultural products. This hybrid corporate strategy represents a paradigm shift. What started as a defensive strategy and intended to protect our balance sheet rapidly evolved into an opportunistic strategy as we sought to create shareholder value during the pandemic crisis. We no longer view Bitcoin acquisition is opportunistic. It is simply our second corporate strategy. Our future now depends on how we manage and develop our intellectual property, that is software, as well as how we manage and develop our digital property that is Bitcoin. I'd like to talk a bit about our performance in these two strategies. It's now over two years -- about two years since we embarked on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. And while I think a minimum holding period for a long-term investment would be four years, it seems fitting that we should do a midterm review of results so far. Since August 11, 2020, our stock has outperformed Bitcoin as well as every major asset class, along with every major big tech stock. Now why do we choose August 11, 2020? That was the day we announced our Bitcoin strategy, and we've coupled it with the Dutch auction where we offered to buy back $250 million of our shares. So we embarked upon this strategy on August 11. When we looked back at where did MicroStrategy close the day before? It's up 123% since we embarked on that strategy. Where is Bitcoin gone? Bitcoin is up 94% since we announced our Bitcoin strategy. So MicroStrategy has actually outperformed it quite. We've captured more than 100% of the alpha of Bitcoin. From a standing start, the S&P index is up 23% in that same time frame. NASDAQ is up 13%. So as you can see, we've outperformed by a factor of 10 NASDAQ stocks in general. We've outperformed the entire S&P by a factor of 5. The option that we had when we chose Bitcoin was gold. We said digital gold or gold. Gold is down 13% since that fateful day. So Bitcoin plus 94%, gold down minus 13%; MicroStrategy up 123%. We could have held our $500 million plus of treasury assets and bonds. And the conventional view is to hold bonds. Well, we could have held short-dated bonds that generated 0% interest or we could have bought midrange bonds. And if we look at the PIMCO BOND Index, B-O-N-D, that index is down 14% since August 11, 2020. And of course, for those who believe in silver instead of gold, silver is down 29%. So as you can see, when we're choosing a treasury reserve asset, Bitcoin outperformed all other reasonable treasury reserve assets. Now we actually considered MicroStrategy performance and Bitcoin's performance against big tech, too. For those of you who know me, you know I wrote the mobile wave and I've been a big advocate of big tech digital monopolies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook. You can see Google in this time period is up 54%. MicroStrategy more than doubled it. Apple, up 43%; Microsoft, up 34%. So we managed to beat those three digital monopolies. But the other interesting thing is that half of big tech is down in that same period. Amazon has lost 14% of its value, Meta Group or Facebook down 39%, and Netflix down 53%. So if we look at all these numbers, and if you recall, when we announced our strategy, we said we were considering all possible treasury reserve options. We managed to choose the single one, bitcoin that's plus 94% to beat everything. And MicroStrategy executed on that. We basically started by buying $250 million of bitcoin. We executed on that, so as to not just capture a fraction of the Bitcoin return, but actually more than 100% of the bitcoin return for our shareholders in that time period. During this period, we've successfully raised $2.4 billion in debt and $1 billion in equity. And we expanded our enterprise valuation from approximately $666 million to $5.6 billion, an increase of approximately $5 billion or over 730% in those two years. These results probably come as a surprise to many, since there's a tendency to focus on short-term volatility of bitcoin and its related impact on our share price. As a publicly traded operating business that holds digital property, MicroStrategy unlike any other enterprise software company. With our deep knowledge of business intelligence, rich enterprise analytics software platform and distributed network of loyal global providers -- sorry, loyal global customers providing us with a stream of revenues and cash flow, we're unlike any conventional holder of digital assets. That means we need to think differently about how we manage our firm and maximize shareholder value overtime. For an analyst, considering how to value a hybrid software digital asset firm such as MicroStrategy, it makes sense to consider the value of each of the components of the business and then calculate the sum of the parts. The software business can be valued as a revenue a\u0302\u0080\u0093 as a multiple of revenue or earnings with consideration given to the likely growth rate, the customer loyalty and the quality of those recurring revenues.  The digital asset business can be valued at net asset value with a premium based on an assessment of, A, the ability of the management team to execute effectively; and B, the prospects of the digital asset. Adopting this framework, we've organized our firm in order to maximize the performance of both elements of our business, while using finance to identify and capitalize on synergies that come from pairing, a stable enterprise software business with a large, potentially high-growth admittedly volatile digital asset holding. Now I'd like to talk about the outlook. We are still early in the adoption cycle of digital assets and Bitcoin in general. There is clearly a strong demand around the world for a number of things. First of all, A, a digital property to serve as a long-term store of value asset; B, a digital commodity to service a trading alternative to energy, metals and other physical commodities. C, a digital payments network that's open, neutral, fast and free for all to use. D, a digital currency that can serve as a medium of exchange for those unable to access dollars via the traditional banking system or for those who wish to trade at the speed of light, friction-free on mobile phones and websites. Stable coins like US DC are examples of such a currency. E, digital exchange that allows anyone to trade all currencies and all assets 24/7, 365. These five things are the clear innovations and there's extraordinary excitement and enthusiasm around those ideas. Global consensus has built over the past two years that the world would benefit from these technologies, and we need these digital assets to build the economy of the 21st century. Bitcoin serves as the ethical, technical and economic foundation of this emerging digital economy due to its macular conception, it's recognition as a commodity without an issuer, global brand recognition and worldwide network of mining operators with tens of billions in special purpose hardware and energy contracts that provide unmatched security and network integrity. The current wave of crypto rationalization, regulation and innovation is healthy for this industry over the mid and the long time frame. And we expect Bitcoin will be the prime beneficiary of all these trends. The demise of Celsius, Voyager and 3 eras has removed unhealthy business practices and dangerous leverage from the system, educating millions of market participants on the merits of holding an asset like Bitcoin without counterparty risk and taking self-custody or placing that asset in cold storage. Regulators have been catalyzed by the crypto market meltdown and accelerated plans for regulating exchanges, cryptosecurities and stable coins. We should see regulatory clarity come earlier than we would otherwise expected, and it is clear from communications, from Congress and regulatory bodies, the more focus is going to be placed on the digital assets industry and the rules and related initiatives will be fast tracked. Many large institutional investors have yet to make substantial allocations of capital to this new asset class because they're waiting for this regulatory clarity. So the focus that regulators are placing on the crypto industry is welcome news to us, and we believe a net positive for Bitcoin. Even while there is market turmoil, innovation and adoption continue in the digital asset space. The Bitcoin network has settled more than 17 trillion transactions this year, and the Lightning Network continues to expand at a rapid pace, reaching record levels of liquidity and scale each quarter. Every week, new banks announced Bitcoin custody services, no derivative products are coming to market, and new financial service providers continue to enter the space, offering trading, analysis and banking services to the swelling population of investors. The growing interest in Bitcoin from banks, such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan, Santander, as well as Fidelity's initiatives to offer 401(k) services that include Bitcoin are indicative of this trend. Macroeconomic trends continue to favor and drive the adoption of digital assets as well. In the past two years, numerous currencies in South America, Africa and Asia have collapsed. And even traditional strong economies are suffering from currency weakness. The Great British pound, the Korean won, the South African rand are all down 12% in the last 12 months. The euro is down 14% against the dollar. The Polish zloty and the Japanese yen are down 17% against the dollar, and the Turkish lira is down 54%. The strengthening dollar has created a demand around the world for digital currency. Since many people outside the US would prefer to trade their local currency for US dollars and many people outside the traditional banking system can install a digital bank on their mobile phone in a few minutes and enter the global economy using the US dollar as a medium of exchange and Bitcoin as a store of value. We believe that Bitcoin should be the primary beneficiary of these trends. Since it is still a small fraction of the market capitalization of gold commodities, property, currency, bonds and commercial real estate. Continued inflation will create a need for a non-sovereign store value asset that is neutral and globally available. Technology will make it easier and more functional to use, and ongoing education and regulation efforts will introduce more investors to this new asset class each year and make them more comfortable holding wealth in the form of digital property. MicroStrategy has ambitious plans to grow both parts of our business. There's a continuing need for enterprise analytics everywhere, and we are well-positioned to grow with our best-in-class integrated business intelligence platform. We expect to accelerate our transition to cloud-based intelligent services and exploit our increasing brand awareness and global reach to gain new customers and deepen our relationships with existing clients. We also have a unique opportunity to continue growing our Bitcoin holdings via more acquisitions financed by cash flows, debt, and equity. We're one of the few operating companies in the world that has the technical capability and the corporate mandate to acquire and own Bitcoin as well as issue Bitcoin-backed financings. We're also uniquely positioned to develop enterprise software that leverages the Bitcoin network. We expect more opportunities will come our way and we intend to be ready to take advantage of our leadership position in the bitcoin industry when the time is right. Given this dramatic increase in the scope of our ambitious plans and the scale of our balance sheet assets. We've decided that the firm would be best served by expanding and reorganizing the management team. Andrew Kang recently joined our team as Chief Financial Officer, assuming responsibilities that were previously handled by Phong Le. Many of you will be hearing from Andrew for the first time on our earnings review call today and we're delighted to have him aboard. For the past two years, Phong Le has served as our President and CFO. Now, we feel it is the right time to elevate him to the role of President and CEO responsible for all of our corporate operations. Phong's the ideal candidate to take the CEO role. He joined our firm in 2015 as CFO, progressively assuming responsibility for Human Resources, Facilities and Information Systems. And later expanded his scope to manage sales and services as our Chief Operating Officer. Two years ago, he assumed responsibility for Marketing and Technology as well when he was elevated to President. In all of these roles, he's been successful and he's gained the respect of the Board as well as the respect of our employees, customers, partners, and vendors. So, the progression to CEO is both natural and well-deserved. Phong will also join our Board of Directors as a member of the Board. I will assume a new full-time role as Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. I will remain an Executive Officer and Employee of the company and Chairman of the Board of Directors as well as assuming the role of Chair of our Investments Committee, where I will continue to provide oversight for our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. My focus will be on our corporate strategy, our innovation efforts, our Bitcoin strategy and related Bitcoin advocacy and education initiatives, such as my work with the Bitcoin Mining Council. I will continue to act as an enthusiastic spokesperson for MicroStrategy and as our envoy to the Global Bitcoin community. As global adoption of digital assets accelerates, this is becoming an ever more expansive job, and I'm comforted increasing the scope of my advocacy efforts knowing that the execution of the MicroStrategy business plan rests in the capable hands of Phong, Andrew and the rest of our executive team. These changes will take place as of August 8, 2022. At that time, the company will have a dedicated Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Kang; a dedicated President and CEO, Phong Le; and a dedicated Executive Chairman and myself. This represents a welcome strengthening of our management team as we prepare for the next phase of corporate growth at MicroStrategy. I'm personally excited about this news. The three of us make a great team. We work together well and possess mutually complementary skills and experience. This will be a benefit to our shareholders, customers, employees, partners as well as to the broader community as we continue to lead the way in Business Intelligence and Bitcoin corporate adoption. Now I would like to pass the floor to Phong Le, our President and soon-to-be CEO to provide an operational review of our business results. Okay. Can you hear me? Yes. The matter of CEO succession has been carefully considered and planned for at the Board level for many years. We believe in proactively developing our leadership team, and we realize the future of the firm is dependent upon our ability to cultivate successive generations of executives and promote from within. I had seven years of closely working with Phong on a day-to-day basis on IT projects, sales activities, on technology, on marketing, on services, on facilities, on finance initiatives. And the Board had seven years of experience with him because he was the CFO throughout that time, and he was closely involved with the Board every single quarter. When Phong was promoted to President of the company two years ago, I think it was pretty clear to company watchers that he was my era parent. So in summary, this is a decision seven years in the making when we finally got to the point that seemed right. It was an easy one to execute on. Yes, it's a great question. We anticipated bitcoin volatility and we understood the accounting implications when we embarked on our Bitcoin strategy. I view both of these as competitive advantages for our firm. The volatility means that, A, bitcoin is more interesting than less volatile assets. And B, MicroStrategy is more interesting than companies holding less volatile assets. The phrase that comes to mind is volatility is vitality. We believe one of the reasons Bitcoin is the best-performing asset class of the last decade is because the volatility attracts interest, capital trading, it creates opportunities -- it's very special. Our firm visibility has been increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude since we embarked on our Bitcoin strategy. And interest in our securities has also increased by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude.  We don't have to try to convince companies to want to cover our stock and explain why we're unique? They're hearing from lots and lots of other channels that were unique and the fact that Bitcoin is volatile means that, on the weekend, Bitcoin spikes up 20% or 10% then our stock might be mispriced and all of a sudden, there's someone that's thinking about it and obsessing about what to do on Monday morning and maybe the opposite. And the fact that they're obsessing means they have to discover us, and they notice us. And when they notice us, they started asking questions, what does MicroStrategy do? Oh, software, Tell me more about that. So, every CFO, CEO, CXOs, the C-suite, they've heard of us, the media they've heard of us. Traders have an economic incentive to invest in MicroStrategy. And I used to joke with people. If you like Bitcoin, then you'll like us. But if you hate Bitcoin, you'll still like us, because people that hate Bitcoin, they want to trade our stock and people do like Bitcoin want to trade our stock and everybody's got to have an opinion on it. So, the volatility just attracts attention and attracts capital, and it makes the company much more interesting. As for -- and the interest is important, because the thing you don't want is to be irrelevant to the world. When nobody knows you and nobody cares whether you succeed or don't, and no one knows what you do, that's the kiss of death. And so, our company has really emerged on this world scene, and it has helped us to sell to market, to recruit, to retain employees to find shareholders, et cetera. And so, I see those as all positives. I think the accounting treatment also benefits our firm, because we decided to adopt the Bitcoin standard. So, in an accounting treatment, that's indefinite and intangible, it's kind of challenging to be 3% committed or 2% committed or 18% committed. But when you're all in, all committed and people know they can multiply the price of bitcoin times 129,699 in any given day and then add in what they think the software business is worth, it actually -- it makes things easy, and we were able to do this because we launched that Dutch auction on August 11, 2020. Most other firms would find this a very daunting corporate transition and they wouldn't be able to sort of completely transform the corporate balance sheet with the support of the shareholders and the way that we did it with that transformational deal. So, as a result of that, because people are afraid of volatility and sometimes, they're off put by the accounting, we have been able to develop a lead in the digital asset space as the first and the largest public operating company on a Bitcoin standard, and I think that has given us a sustainable competitive edge and a differentiator that we can use to continue to build shareholder value going forward. Well, I think the executive structure is going to be a benefit to all of us. First of all, we're actually expanding the management team with the addition of Andrew. And that gives us a full-time finance executive, and as you know, our balance sheet has grown with our debt offerings and our ability to issue equity and the explosion of our enterprise value from $666 million to $5.5 billion, means that the finance function has become a full-time job in its own. And so Andrew has arrived and brought some new skills with him, but also Andrew has made it possible for us to promote Phong to President and Chief Executive Officer, and Phong is just an incredibly gifted operating executive and with the support of Andrew and with the CEO role and the unambiguous power that comes with it, Phong will be more effective and able to move more efficiently and drive the corporate mission. And I feel comfortable with Phong and Andrew in place as well as with the -- we haven't mentioned the rest of the executive team, but we have an awesome CXO team, right, our Head of Technology, our Head of IT, our Head of Consulting, our Head of Sales, right? And our Head of Marketing, they're the unsung heroes that aren't on this call right now. But that team is just very accomplished, very stable. And this new executive structure means that I can even more enthusiastically focus upon communications and strategy and Bitcoin advocacy and evangelism knowing that I'm not ignoring the nuts and bolts day-to-day operations of the business, of which therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s 100,000 things you have to do well every year in a software company, and they need to get done, and they will get done. But the world of Bitcoin is exploding. And everywhere in the world, people are interested in how they plug into this network, and how can MicroStrategy integrate with them? And so that's a job that's actually growing in scope. So I feel like I'll be more effective, Phong will be more effective. Andrew's welcome addition. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s just a win-win-win. I want to thank everybody for your support, and Phong, Andrew, Shirish and I will all look forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks, and we wish you a happy summer. Have a good day."

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you, Phong. I am delighted to be with everyone today and would like to start by turning to our second quarter 2022 financial results in more detail. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $122 million, down 3% year-over-year. While weakening foreign currencies impacted our revenues this quarter when isolating FX impacts, total revenue increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Total software license revenues, which consist of both product license revenues and subscription services revenues were in total $34 million, up 5% year-over-year or up 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The growth in total software license revenues this past quarter reflects our strategic focus on the migration of our platform to the cloud, which Phong highlighted earlier. In the second quarter, cloud subscription service revenues were $14 million, an increase of 36% year-over-year or up 40% on a constant currency basis. Total product license revenues were $20 million, a decrease of 9% year-over-year or a decrease of 6% on a constant currency basis. And product support revenues were $66.5 million, a decrease of 6% year-over-year or 2% lower on a constant currency basis. Both product license and product support revenues are impacted when new and existing customers convert to our cloud model. And as a result, we expect those revenues to modestly decline alongside a corresponding increase in cloud subscription revenues and billings. It is important to note that even in light of this transition, our on-prem customers continue to reflect the durability of our business as demonstrated with a Q2 support renewal rate of 95% among the highest we've ever experienced. Finally, other services revenues, which largely reflect our consulting business, were $21.4 million this quarter, a decrease of 2% year-over-year but an increase of 4% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see positive trends in our consulting business through increased billable rates and our worldwide while optimizing costs through a global and highly skilled technology-consulting workforce. The 4% constant currency growth year-over-year is a strong indication of the desire from our customers to modernize and grow their deployment of MicroStrategy. Moving to billings. Our current total software license billings were $39.9 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year. In the second quarter, current subscription billings were $20.1 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year, reflecting the same strong growth momentum we saw at the end of last year. This increase was driven by solid results in both subscription service revenues as well as current deferred subscription service revenues. Also worth noting, our largest cloud billings in Q2 were sold as multiyear contracts with an average term of over 24 months of which only 12 months are reflected on our balance sheet. We believe the demand to migrate MicroStrategy to the cloud remains very strong with additional pipeline being added from both our domestic and international customers. Shifting to costs. Total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude share-based comp, were $1.02 billion in the second quarter compared to $529 million in the second quarter of 2021. Aside from the bitcoin impairment expense that I will discuss in a moment, our costs this quarter reflect modest increase in areas specific to building out our cloud platform, retaining and attracting talent while focusing on efficiencies and corporate cost areas. Starting from the left of the chart, non-GAAP cost of revenues were $24 million in the second quarter of an increase of $1.6 million or 7% year-over-year. As a percentage of the total revenues, these costs, which are still scaling up to support the build-out of cloud reflect an increase of 2%, which was largely attributed to higher hosting fees and investments in technology talent. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $32 million, a decrease of $4.6 million or 13% year-over-year. As a percentage of total software license revenues, the second quarter decrease of 19% year-over-year continues to reflect improvements in the productivity of our sales and marketing teams, along with an increase in capitalized commissions compared to last year. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $29 million, which was an increase of $2.6 million or 10% year-over-year. This was an increase of 3% as a percentage of total revenues driven by the ongoing competitive environment for talent across the tech sector. We are anticipating that this trend will continue in the near term. However, as we prioritize overall spend in the second half and into next year, we will continue to be strategic and opportunistic in investing in R&D to attract and retain engineering talent and to drive innovation that creates demand for our products. Non-GAAP G&A expense was $22 million, an increase of $3.8 million or 20% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 3%. The overall macroeconomic environment and inflation challenges continue to create headwinds for our bottom line. The fact is, though, our business is operating well and our cost structure is stable. However, in the coming quarters, we will be intentional in prioritizing spend while focusing on areas that drive profitability, while continuing to promote a strong workplace culture. The largest non-GAAP expense for the quarter was the Bitcoin impairment charge of $918 million. You will recall that the GAAP treatment of Bitcoin impairment charges treats our Bitcoin holdings as indefinite wealth intangible assets under the applicable accounting rules, which means that any decrease in the fair value below our carrying value at any time subsequent to acquisition, requires us to recognize an impairment charge. Due to the bitcoin price volatility in Q2, the impairment on our Bitcoin holdings was measured against a low watermark Bitcoin price of approximately $17,600, if the future of Bitcoin prices remain above the low watermark, under the current accounting rules, we would not recognize any additional impairment against a substantial portion of our June 30, 2022 Bitcoin holdings.  On Slide 18, total non-GAAP operating loss in the second quarter of 2022 was $903 million, which includes the $918 million Bitcoin impairment charge I just spoke about. I'd like to highlight that since the adoption of our Bitcoin strategy in Q3 2020, the digital asset impairment charges we have incurred in every quarter since inception have always been greater than our non-GAAP operating losses. While our Bitcoin holdings are impaired when the price drops below the carrying value under current accounting rules, conversely, when the price increases, accounting rules do not allow the carrying value to be revised upward. We feel optimistic that the financial accounting standards board recently unanimously agreed to review the accounting rules for exchange-traded digital assets and commodities as part of their upcoming technical agenda, which could lead to a change in how digital assets are accounted for in the future. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2 billion, which reflects approximately $2 billion in cumulative impairment charges. As you can see in the chart, the market value of our Bitcoin holdings as of each quarter end has always been greater than the carrying value under the current rules. The capital markets have established us -- enabled us to be agile and access both the equity and debt markets in an efficient way to grow our enterprise value. As you can see on Slide 20, the earliest of our debt maturities are not due until March 2025 and the blended interest rate of our total $2.4 billion in debt is only 1.9%. As of quarter end, we had $69 million in cash on our balance sheet, and we expect cash flows from operations will be sufficient to cover our ongoing interest expense needs. Going forward, subject to market conditions, we will continue to evaluate opportunities that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders that further our Bitcoin strategy or optimize our existing capital structure. As of June 30, 2022, we held a total of 129,699 Bitcoins, of which 14,589 Bitcoins were held directly at MicroStrategy, the parent, all of which secure our 2028 notes. The remaining approximately 115,000 Bitcoins are held at our subsidiary macro strategy. Of the Bitcoins held at the sub, approximately 30,000 bitcoins are pledged as collateral to the Silvergate loan and just over 85,000 Bitcoins remain unpledged and available for use. These unencumbered Bitcoin is equivalent to approximately $2 billion, assuming a market price of about 23,000 per Bitcoins. Our Bitcoin strategy remains simple, buy and hold for the long term, and that is it. In Q2, the amount of Bitcoin pledge of macro strategy increased by 10,585 Bitcoins to support the Silvergate loan as Bitcoin prices fell to the Q2 lows. Our $205 million Bitcoin back loan requires us to maintain a loan-to-value or LTV of 50% or less, and we have the ability to contribute additional Bitcoin to meet the requirement as needed, which we did in Q2. If the price of Bitcoin appreciates and the LTV ratio is less than 25% at any time, we are also then able to withdraw any of the excess collateral at that time. With approximately 85,000 available unpledged Bitcoin, we have more than sufficient collateral to meet the ongoing requirements of the loan through any foreseeable price volatility. Finally, before I open up the call for Q&A, I would like to say that I'm extremely honored to be part of the MicroStrategy team and excited to be working with Mike and Phong in their new roles, where we are all aligned on executing on the corporate strategies of operating and growing our enterprise analytics business and acquiring and holding Bitcoin for the long-term. I believe MicroStrategy is truly in a category of one; having successfully combined a long-standing software business with a successful track record and deep customer base with a pioneering corporate treasury strategy to acquire Bitcoin as a store of value to become the largest corporate holder of the Bitcoin in the world. Thank you for your time today. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Shirish for Q&A Thank you for the question, Shirish. I believe the company has executed so far in a very prudent and well thought out capital structure framework. Really since 2020 and it has been extremely successful, as evidenced earlier, when Mike explained our stock performance over the last year compared to our comps. Our approach to debt or equity will remain the same as it has. We will continue to evaluate access to the markets that are most accretive, and we will look to obtain the most premium for dollars generated. That being said, right now in the current market, we are continuing to evaluate all the various opportunities and really have the luxury of continuing to be thoughtful on any future balance sheet execution. So, for the moment we're a bit of evaluate wait and see, but I can assure you that whatever we do in the future, we will continue to do so in a prudent and safe manner. Sure. I think tagging on to what Phong said earlier, our cost structure is very stable. And I think that's the benefit of being a long-standing company in business for over 30 years. And we haven't had this massive growth in head count. Head count has been very stable. We haven't over hired as we've seen many in the market do recently. So I think from a cost perspective, we will continue to focus on areas that are accretive to profitability. We'll look to be opportunistic where we can on bringing in new talent, in fact, around key areas like tech and cloud and sales. And we'll really scrutinize the other costs that we think we can be more efficient. And I've got the benefit of coming in and getting to ask a lot of new questions on certain expenses and costs. And so I think that will be helpful and understanding where we can be more efficient. But ultimately, I think we're going to be opportunistic and spend in areas that will help our business grow."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. I'm honored and looking forward to leading this truly innovative organization in my new role as President and CEO. MicroStrategy has founded 33 years ago as a technology innovator with a vision of intelligence everywhere. Since then, we've become a global leader in business intelligence serving the largest, most respected enterprises and government organizations in the world. We've also been a technology pioneer in the fields of relational, web, mobile and cloud analytics. Our employees and executives are the foundation upon which our strength in enterprise analytics was built, and I'm enthusiastic to work with them to continue to grow this business going forward. More recently, MicroStrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of corporation's treasury policy. We believe it's still early and further adoption of Bitcoin globally can have a positive effect on the Bitcoin price, which has the potential to offer upside to our shareholders. Bitcoin is the right long-term store value for MicroStrategy, enterprises, institutions, individuals and the world. Our history of innovation has allowed MicroStrategy to be successful for a sustained period of time. I plan to continue to build a culture and a company where innovation thrives. In addition, our ecosystem of customers, partners, shareholders and employees are essential to our success. Our commitment and focus on this group will strengthen under my leadership. I look forward to leading the organization for the long-term health and growth of our enterprise software and Bitcoin acquisition strategies. I'd also like to thank Michael Saylor. Following Mike's footsteps, our founder and a pioneer in enterprise analytics Bitcoin for institutions and CEO of MicroStrategy for 33 years is a great honor and a great responsibility. I've learned a tremendous amount for Mike over the last seven years, and I'm honored to build upon his foundation at MicroStrategy. I look forward to continuing to work with him in my new role as President and Chief Executive Officer; and as a member of the Board and his new role as Executive Chairman. I'll now focus on the Q2 2022 business results. Overall, we are pleased with our results in Q2. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment due to high inflation, weakening foreign currencies and the ongoing war in Ukraine, we achieved total revenue growth at constant currency on the strength of our cloud business. We had strong growth in our subscription revenue and billings driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer revenue renewal rates continue to be among the highest we've ever experienced. To summarize our second quarter software results. Revenues increased 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Total software license revenues, which we consider to consist of total product licenses and subscription services revenues and our consolidated statement of operations increased 8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We benefited from the increased adoption of our cloud platform, partially offset by a decrease in product license revenues. Over time, we expect our revenue profile to continue to shift towards recurring subscription revenue. Subscription revenue increased 40% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Current subscription billings grew 51% year-over-year, our ninth straight quarter of double-digit growth and our second best quarter ever. We're also seeing growing adoption of our cloud platform in our international customers with several major wins in Q2. We continue to focus on three key areas of growth that represent core MicroStrategy differentiators; enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and the cloud. Our customers depend on these differentiating capabilities to build mission-critical applications to run their field forces, store operations, risk analysis groups, corporate operations and much more. For our first growth area, I'm pleased to share the MicroStrategy ranked number one in the enterprise analytics use case in Gartner's 2022 Critical Capabilities report for the second year in a row. We found that during volatile economic times, organizations rely heavily on their analytics and look to enhance how they get that information in the hands of their end users effectively. The ability to deliver data analytics at scale with high performance and security remains a critical success factor for our thousands of customers worldwide. So we're proud to receive this designation once again. Moving on to enterprise analytics. We continue to see growth with customers who build MicroStrategy into the software solutions that they sell to end users, leveraging our open embedded analytics capabilities. Our focus on innovation and research and development has enabled us to continue to modernize our platform with improved immersive interactive user interfaces, simple no-code and low-code application development with open APIs and innovative capabilities like mobile and HyperIntelligence. Finally, as MicroStrategy Cloud continues to be a growing part of our business mix, we expect to accelerate growth through increased cloud adoption by both new and existing customers. New customers are increasingly cloud first and choose to deploy directly on MicroStrategy Cloud. At the same time, more and more existing on-premise customers are migrating to the cloud, and expanding their MicroStrategy usage to new departments and user groups. We also expect to launch in Q3 this year, MicroStrategy Cloud for government, our new cloud offering with FedRAMP authorization. This product is our first generally available release of our cloud platform that relies on a modern cloud-native architecture utilizing containers and microservices. It also continues to deliver the enterprise-grade security, stability and scalability that our customers have grown to expect. This combination of FedRAMP authorization, enterprise-grade capabilities and managed service delivery will help us further differentiate our solutions with government, large enterprises and embedded analytics customers worldwide. Our combined focus on enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and cloud services has resulted in more customers relying on us for an end-to-end business intelligence strategy. Off a decommissioning and consolidating legacy platforms in favor of an enterprise-wide adoption of MicroStrategy. This has led to increasing revenue renewal rates every year in the last three years. In summary, our outlook for the software business remains positive with our continued transition to cloud and our expectation of further increases in subscription billings. Overall, we're very pleased with the pace of product innovation. And we feel confident in our ability to achieve our long-term sales growth and profitability targets. Turning to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, we purchased 481 Bitcoins for $10 million in Q2, and an average purchase price of $20,790 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. We've not sold any Bitcoin to date. To reiterate, our strategy, we seek to acquire and hold Bitcoin long term, and we do not currently plan to engage in sales of Bitcoin. As of June 30, 2022, the company owned an aggregate of approximately 129,699 Bitcoins that we acquired for a total cost of $4 billion or $30,000 an 30,664 per bitcoin net of fees and expenses. We have a long-term time horizon and the core business is not impacted by the near-term price fluctuations of Bitcoin. As I mentioned earlier, we're a technology company with more than 30 years of history of innovation and are going to remain laser-focused on technology innovation. We prudently manage our capital allocation strategy and people strategy. As seen in the current markets, many software and crypto exposed companies have had to adjust a periods of rapid cost and headcount growth by rightsizing their teens or freezing hiring. In contrast, we have the benefit of a long history with our product and our customers, a stable, experienced executive team, and a long-term focus. We're in a strong position from a people and product perspective, and will strategically hire and invest in our people, while at the same time being cognizant of the current macroeconomic environment and careful in managing our costs. Finally, I'd like to introduce our CFO, Andrew King. He joined the company in May. I'm thrilled to see Andrew step into this critical leadership role, where he will be able to contribute from his 20-plus years of experience in banking finance, treasury and capital markets. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail. Well, I think Mike stated, we've been working together for seven years now in my capacity as CFO on and off, two years as President. I think we're fairly aligned in how to run both an enterprise software company and very aligned, working very closely together in the last two years in our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. So, I would sort of see this as a business-as-usual transition, where we get to even further clarify our roles in the organization, with our employees, with customers, with partners, with shareholders in the media, and I don't have any significant changes planned. Probably the biggest changes that we've observed is really Andrew's arrival two months ago and him now running the finance organization very credibly. And professionally, it gives me more time to run the company and gives Mike more time to focus on corporate strategy, innovation and the Bitcoin strategy. Thanks, Shirish. It's a good question. We were able to -- in my opinion withstand some of these macroeconomic challenges in the second quarter, as you saw, primarily by growing in the cloud. I think the second half, we'll see more macroeconomic changes, challenges, the strong dollar, unpredictability the War in Ukraine, etcetera. So, I think there will be more challenges. Our intent is to try to continue to grow. I think cloud will help us. As you all know, and as I and Andrew explained, growing in the cloud does have a short-term negative impact on product license revenue and also has a short-term negative impact on total revenue. So that will create probably more distraction in our revenues than the macroeconomic challenges. But I think we'll be able to continue to grow. I'm optimistic about it. That said, we're going to be prudent and thoughtful. We're not going to get out ahead of our skis on cost. And we'll see how the business continues. But things have been going fairly well when we see macroeconomic challenges, given our sort of -- given our strength in enterprise analytics and embedded analytics in the cloud and we'll be cautious but optimistic in the second half. No, I think Mike said it very well. We're focused on growing the revenue. I think we have the right cost structure in place to do it. So I don't believe we need to sacrifice revenue growth by reducing if we were to reduce our costs, I think we can continue to grow at the current cost structure. And I think that will also start to result in margin expansion. So they're not direct trade-offs in my opinion. Yeah. On a recognized revenue basis, our cloud subscription revenue is about 15% of our recurring revenue. On a billings basis, it's about 20%. So we haven't reached that an inflection point where our SaaS business gets to, I would say, north of 40%, whereas we continue to grow, it's fully accretive to revenue in the short-term. Right now it's accretive to revenue in the long-term, but not quite the short-term. So I think we have some time left. Obviously, all of you -- many of you have seen companies go from a perpetual license to a subscription revenue transition in the past. And I think you're familiar with that short-term dip in product license revenue and its impact on total revenue, and how that comes out on the other end with an acceleration of revenue. So we're going through right now -- there's high demand for cloud, which is exciting. Our customers understand the value proposition. Our marketers understand how to explain. Our salespeople understand how to sell it. And we are learning better-and-better how to operate at scale. So it's, I would say, full speed ahead with the cloud transition. Yeah. Thanks, Shirish. I do think we're seeing choppier demand, elongated deal cycles more challenges in our selling environment, especially in international. All that said, as I mentioned before, if we can push through and execute, leverage our expertise in enterprise analytics, the fact that we build applications that large enterprises rely on, especially in turbulent times and leverage our cloud transition, I think we can work through this and grow in the second half and in the future. But there's certainly more volatility, we have to be better at execution. We have to be more precise in managing our pipeline, and our sales cycles, and our opportunities, and our customer engagements, and our conversations. So look, it requires better execution in these types of times. And this is what we're good at. We're a company that has great product, great strategy and great execution. So it's hard, but we'll work through it."

I'll be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2022 First Quarter Earnings webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and presentation, which were issued today and are available on our website at microstrategy.com. I would like to welcome you all to today's webinar and let you know that we will taking questions using the Q&A feature at the bottom of your screen.  With that, I will turn the call over to Michael Saylor, Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. Michael?\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Shirish. I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2022 first quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who's going to provide an update on our operations and the financials for the quarter.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Michael. We continue to be pleased across both our corporate strategies in the first quarter of 2022. Here is a summary of our first quarter software results. Revenues declined 3% year-over-year and were flat on a constant currency basis. We saw some revenue headwinds in Q1. This included a more challenging macroeconomic environment due to war in Ukraine, a tough comparison in Q1 2021, where we saw license revenue grow 69% and total revenue grow 10% year-over-year, and ongoing cloud growth, which has a short-term negative impact on product license and total revenue. Our cloud business continues its momentum with subscription revenue growing 28% year-over-year and current subscription billings growing 18% year-over-year, our eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth. We had several large cloud deals slipped from Q1 due to macroeconomic uncertainty, which caused billings growth to decline sequentially. Turning now to our Bitcoin strategy. We had another active and successful quarter. We purchased $215 million of Bitcoin at an average purchase price of $44,645 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. We have not sold any bitcoin to-date. These purchases were funded by excess cash in our business as well as through a $205 million first-ever public company Bitcoin back term loan. I'll discuss the terms of the loan in more detail in our financial section. In total, we have raised an aggregate of $3.4 billion in new debt and equity capital that we've deployed in support of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. To reiterate our strategy, we seek to acquire and hold Bitcoin long term. We view our Bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not currently plan to engage in sales of Bitcoin. As of March 31, 2022, the company own an aggregate of 129,218 bitcoins that we acquired for a total cost of $3.97 billion or $30,700 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. The market value of our Bitcoin holdings was $5.9 billion at March 31, 2022 reflecting $1.9 billion of unrealized gains or nearly 50% appreciation when compared to the original cost basis of our bitcoin at March 31, 2022. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of March 31, 2022, was roughly $2.9 billion, reflecting $1.1 billion in cumulative impairment charges. We continue to see opportunities for MicroStrategy to target a multibillion-dollar software market that is at an early stage of moving off of legacy tech into the cloud. We're well positioned to meet the demands of enterprise customers with our modern analytics platform.  As we discussed in detail on our last earnings call, we see three key areas of growth for us: enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and cloud, where we will seek to grow by developing our pipeline, making our customers successful and continuing to innovate, automate and simplify our technology stack.  Next, I would like to provide you an update on the product enhancements in our latest platform release, which expands the value provided to our customers and represents future incremental growth opportunities. In particular, the product now includes an impressive differentiated set of new capabilities that enable organizations to build seamless, scalable business intelligence applications at a faster pace, either deployed stand-alone or embedded directly into other products. With a fully modern, immersive and interactive design even introduce a simple no-code application development option built on the foundation of MicroStrategy Library, built to empower developers to deploy powerful customized data portals for multiple user groups at enterprise scale and a rapid speed to market. MicroStrategy applications bring a competitive edge to our customers.  Developers can build one app for employees using iPads on the sales floor and another for finance executives and headquarters, all based on the same highly governed single version of the truth. This delivers greater trust, less hassle and lower maintenance costs. All qualities that make MicroStrategy the ideal partner for enterprises and independent software providers. Applications also provide enhanced tolerable security controls to grant limited access and log in, as well as sophisticated embedding functionality for extended flexibility and customization. Speaking of security, MicroStrategy also separated itself from the competition recently by way of our fast, transparent and effective response to the high-profile Log4j and Spring for Shell on their abilities.  Our customers benefited from rapid mitigation and remediation of these issues, solidifying the peace of mind they have come to expect from our partnership. Those customer of MicroStrategy cloud has 0-day fixes installed over the weekend and updates and patches installed in a week.  MicroStrategy continues to be growing, a growing part of the mix. MicroStrategy Cloud continues to be a growing part of the mix of our business. We are on track to accelerate the subscription billings momentum in 2022. We expect to grow by migrating on-prem customers to the cloud, expanding the footprint for existing cloud customers, and defaulting deployment of as many new customers as possible to the cloud. We also expect to have our MicroStrategy FedRAMP-compliant version of our software available in Q3 this year. For those customers that are not yet ready to move to cloud, such as those in highly regulated industries or countries, we remain committed to supporting them also. Our underlying cloud architecture is also improving, leveraging containers and micro services. This architecture is built to deliver highly scalable multi-tenant SaaS solutions across tens of thousands of users and provide developers with a streamlined experience to leverage continuous integration and continuous development. Overall, I'm very pleased with the pace of product innovation and we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets while maintaining profitability. Finally, our Annual User Conference, MicroStrategy World, was another tremendous success. World 22 was our second virtual world event and enable us to reach a bigger, broader audience with customer success stories, product presentations, thought leadership keynotes, and a hugely popular Bitcoin for Corporations Event held in tandem. Our content was available to all for free via an online event platform. The key notes, including the Michael Saylor, Jack Dorsey keynote were simulcast live on YouTube. All-in-all, we had nearly 14,000 registrants on the event platform and over 180,000 viewers of the content across all mediums. Replays for the sessions are available on our website. Turning to our first quarter 2022 financial results in more detail. Revenues for the quarter were $119.3 million, down 3% year-over-year were almost flat on a constant currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, total revenues are up 3% year-over-year. Product license revenues were $16.5 million, down 22% year-over-year or down 20% on a constant currency basis. The decline is mainly due to a large transaction included in Q1 2021 and that contributed the majority of the year-over-year differential. On a trailing 12-month basis, product license revenues are up 2% year-over-year. Subscription services revenues were $12.8 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year or up 30% on a constant currency basis. The growth in subscription services revenues reflects the increased portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform. Our current subscription billings in the first quarter of 2021 were $11.4 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. The growth was lower than expected for the first quarter as some deals slipped out of the first quarter, in part, caused by the ongoing war in Ukraine, impacting the purchasing patterns of customers in Europe and worldwide. We see strong demand and pipeline for our cloud licenses and the potential for our future for further growth going forward. Product support revenues were $67.2 million in the quarter, a decrease of 5% year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis. The decline was partially driven by certain existing customers converting from perpetual product licenses to our subscription services or term licenses offerings and partially by an impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. As we see more on-premise conversions to our cloud offering, we would anticipate product support revenues will experience a modest decline over time. That said, our in-quarter product support renewal rates for Q1 continue to be among the highest we've ever experienced. Finally, other services revenues, which largely reflect our consulting services, were $22.8 million in this quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year or 13% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in billable hours worldwide, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact and a decrease in average billing rates. We believe that growth in consulting revenues is an indication of continued engagement from our customers to modernize, retain and grow their deployment of the MicroStrategy platform. Shifting to our cost. Total non-GAAP expenses include share-based compensation expenses, were $275 million, which excludes share-based compensation expenses, were $275 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to $298 million in the first quarter of 2021. Of this amount, $170 million were bitcoin impairment charges in Q1 2022 and $194 million in Q1 2021. As a reminder, on the treatment of bitcoin impairment charges, our bitcoin holdings are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in their fair value below our carrying value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges. During the first quarter, we incurred digital asset impairment charges of $170 million. As discussed on the last earnings call, on a go-forward basis, any non-GAAP financial measures we may present in future filings will retain the impact from bitcoin impairment charges. This change in the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures does not impact our strategy, operations or GAAP financial statements or previous SEC filings. We'll continue to report the bitcoin impairment charges separately. Now, starting from the bottom of the chart moving up. Non-GAAP cost of revenues were $25 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $2.4 million or 11% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues, this reflects an increase of 2.6%, driven by increases in cloud customer hosting fees and personnel costs from additional headcount. As we continue to accelerate our shift to cloud, we expect increases in infrastructure costs and headcount to support additional customers. And over time, for our cloud business to scale, decreasing costs as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $29 million, a decrease of $6.9 million or 19% year-over-year. The decline is primarily driven by a decrease in variable compensation, mainly due to higher capitalized commissions and decreases in bonus and personnel costs. As a percentage of product license and subscription revenue, the charge reflects a decrease -- the change reflects a decrease of 16%, which in part reflects improved productivity of our sales and marketing teams. Non-GAAP research and development expense was $30 million, an increase of $2.8 million or 10% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 3%, driven by headcount increases, cost of hiring and wage inflation. The technology sector has experienced significant wage inflation and competition for resources, and we anticipate that trend will continue in 2022 and that we'll continue to invest in R&D to retain our talented engineers and develop sophisticated innovative products. We're also shifting some headcount to lower-cost regions, which we expect will result in some cost efficiencies over time. Non-GAAP general and administrative expense was $21 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 11% year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue. This reflects an increase of 2.3%. Overall, we feel comfortable with our cost structure and our ability to generate cash flow sustainably. Total non-GAAP operating loss in the first quarter of 2022 was $155.6 million, inclusive of impairment charge related to Bitcoin and $170.1 million. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of March 31, 2022, was $2.9 billion, which reflects $1.1 billion in cumulative impairment charges have also been reflected as losses on our GAAP income statements in the period incurred. Our non-cash Bitcoin impairment charges will remain subject to market volatility of Bitcoin market prices. As one of the leading advocates for digital assets, we've been working with peer companies and various policy setting agencies in the US to try to develop an alternative accounting framework for digital assets. Currently, companies that aren't investment companies report Bitcoin as intangible assets. This means Bitcoin is initially recorded on balance sheet, so that is the store cost and then is deemed impaired at the market price of the company's principal exchange for Bitcoin drops below the carrying value at any time. However, the carrying value can never conversely be revised upward at the price of Bitcoin increases. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, announced that it had added a project to their research agenda to explore accounting for exchange-traded digital assets. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, we believe we have a responsibility to share what we've learned since embarked on this strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this new asset class. Next, I'll discuss the terms of our first ever Bitcoin backed term loan with Silvergate Bank. We raised $205 million as an interest-only loan for a term of three years, which is collateralized by Bitcoin. The loan matures on March 23, 2025. It bears monthly interest at a floating rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or SOFR, 30-day average as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website plus 3.70% with a floor of 3.75%. The low may be prepaid at any time, subject to modest prepayment premiums. The loan had an initial loan to collateral value of 25%, which was thus collateralized closing by Bitcoin with a value of approximately $820 million. While the loan is outstanding, we are required to maintain an LTV ratio of 50% or less. Which essentially allows for an approximately 50% drop of Bitcoin prices from the time of transaction closing before we're required to post any incremental collateral. We're also allowed to proactively manage the LTV ratio by posting any desired value of additional collateral, if we choose to. If Bitcoin appreciates in price and the LTV ratio is less than 25% at any time, we\u2019re entitled a return of excess collateral so long as the LTV ratio would not exceed 25% after such. Additionally, we have established a $5 million cash reserve account with Silvergate to serve as additional collateral for the loan that can be used towards the interest payments for the last six months of the long-term. Also, we have held back approximately $9 million from the loan proceeds as cash and macro strategy that can be used towards general corporate purposes, including paying interest for this loan or buying additional Bitcoin. This loan is not guaranteed by any party. The agreement does not restrict us from incurring additional debt, permits additional lean so long as such liens are not on the asset serving as collateral for the loan, and permits us to sell assets so long as they are not serving as collateral for the loan. There are no restrictions on utilizing Bitcoin that is not a part of the collateral for this loan. Thus, this loan would be accretive to shareholders. As long as Bitcoin appreciates, more than the issue expense and cumulative interest expense to be occurred -- incurred over the term of the loan. MicroStrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of enterprise's treasury policy, which has generated incremental value for our shareholders, as a snapshot into our current Bitcoin holdings by entities, as of March 31, 2022, of the total of 129,218 Bitcoins held by the company. Roughly 14,100 Bitcoins are held at the MicroStrategy entity, all of which are held as collateral securing our 2028 secured notes. The remaining approximately 115,100 Bitcoins are held at the MacroStrategy subsidiary. Of the MacroStrategy of Bitcoins, approximately 19,500 Bitcoins are pledges collateral towards the Bitcoin back term loan and over 95,600 Bitcoins remain unpledged and unencumbered. We may consider additional opportunities to utilize the strategic asset in the future. For example, subject to market conditions, we may enter into additional bitcoin back financings, we seek to lend our Bitcoin to third parties to generate yield. We will continue to closely monitor market conditions and determine whether to engage in any such transactions and may ultimately decide not to pursue any of these transactions. Next, I would like to emphasize the strength of our robust capital structure. From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we're insulated from the near-term market volatility at Bitcoin prices, since we currently do not have any debt principal maturities coming due until March 2025. The total annualized interest expense today is approximately $44 million, which equates to a blended interest rate of approximately 1.82% on our entire debt obligations of $2.4 billion. We expect cash flows generated from our software business to be sufficient to cover interest obligations, as they become payable. Additionally, we maintain a certain minimum amount of cash balance to fund our regular working capital needs. As of the first quarter, we had $95 million in cash on our balance sheet. Going forward, we'll continue to evaluate debt or equity capital raising and other financing opportunities that we believe will be accretive to shareholders, subject to market conditions and that further our Bitcoin acquisition strategy or optimize our capital structure is needed. We believe that the further adoption of Bitcoin globally will have a positive effect on Bitcoin prices, which has the potential to offer asymmetric upside to our shareholders. Our 2022 outlook remains positive with our continued transition to cloud and our expectation of a sustained increase in subscription billings. Our cloud transition will result in increased subscription revenue and billings. With the continued growth of our subscription billings, it is possible that our product license revenue and total revenue growth will decelerate in the near term, even as our cloud software business -- even as our overall software business expense. This will depend largely on the mix of new sales between cloud and on-premise licenses. This is because of a new cloud contract, which may have a higher total contract value than an on-premise license still results in lower recognized revenue in the first year. Overall, we feel we are well positioned to achieve our long-term sales growth target of greater than 10% and increased free cash flows over time. Finally, I'd like to share an update with you regarding the appointment of our new CFO. I'd like to welcome Andrew Kang, who will be joining MicroStrategy as our new CFO effective on a start date, which we expect to be on or around May 9. I'm thrilled to see him step into this new critical leadership role where he will be able to contribute from his wealth of experience. Andrew has over 20 years of experience in banking and consumer finance and most recently served as CFO for GreenSky, Inc., a publicly-traded fintech company. Prior to GreenSky, Andrew served as the Corporate Treasurer for Santander Holdings USA, the $150 billion US bank holding company under Banco Santander SA. Andrew has also held leadership positions in capital markets, finance, and treasury at Santander Consumer USA, HSBC Finance, and Capital One. Following Andrew's appointment, I look forward to having more time to focus on my role as President, running the day-to-day operations of MicroStrategy as well as strategically planning for our long-term health and growth for both BI and Bitcoin strategies. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss observations for the MicroStrategy World Event, comments on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, as well as regulatory outlook for the digital asset space.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Phong and I want to thank everybody for being with us at here today. I thought I'd start with a few observations of global developments. In Q1, we saw some fairly seminal events, the trucker crisis in Canada, the Ukrainian war, Russian sanctions, continued inflation, supply chain chaos, concerns about food and energy shortages, all of those things have been combined with a weakening currency environment, the Chinese currency, the Japanese currency, South Africa -- South America and African currencies, and a lot of Asian currencies were all collapsing against the dollar. In fact, just about every currency in the world, except for two, I think, are collapsing against the dollar right now. This is creating a very challenging macroeconomic environment. It's going to continue to create uncertainty and challenges for all businesses. I think that it has had the impact of increasing awareness of and the understanding of the need for a digital asset like Bitcoin and so the silver-lining is that hundreds of millions, if not billions of people are now becoming aware of the need for non-sovereign store value digital asset like Bitcoin. The negative is it creates a very challenging operating environment. Over the last few months in the world of Bitcoin, the interesting developments worth highlighting are the Executive Order coming out of the Biden White House on March 9th, which was really a first as long as anyone can remember, the first time that we had the executive branch in the United States in essence highlighting and endorsing an asset class as being critical to the future of the nation. And so I thought that, that was extraordinarily auspicious. Janet Yellen gave a speech on April 7th at American University, equally auspicious. We had the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, laying out the case for decentralized networks, the theory of digital property, talking about the need for digital currencies. What the innovations in the crypto economy and suggesting that the administration is going to do enthusiastically move forward to provide responsible regulations to allow this economy to grow. I thought that was very critical, too. I think if you put all of these macroeconomic developments together with the regulator signal, what you have is a world that's a bit insecure about currencies and insecure about property rights and then, secure about 20th century banking systems and 20th century payment systems and aware that they need to find a solution. But you also have another big development, which is that the Deniers of Bitcoin and Digital Assets in general are now being silenced by the administration of the United States. One of the early crippling criticism was this is just a panty scheme, where this is intangible or there's nothing here. And I think that, with now the Head of the SEC, the Head of Treasury, the President of the United States acknowledging that there is something here. And it's an important priority for the entire government. I think that, that really isolates the Deniers and if not making them look silly at this point, because, it's pretty clear that 250 million people know that there is something here. And it's growing like wildfire. And it's pretty clear that the government recognizes this. So, we have another classification of Bitcoin investors after Deniers that will be the Skeptics. The Skeptics acknowledge that it exists. They acknowledge that it's good. They may even acknowledge that, it's better than gold and it's better than other sorts of money or property and then they follow-up with the observation that since it's so good the politicians will ban it or the government will ban it. And that was -- that's been articulated by a number of fairly well-known credible sources over the past two years. But of course, with the March 9th Executive Order and the Ellen speech of April 7th, it gets increasingly difficult to maintain the skeptical stance, because you would have to, in essence, put yourself in opposition to the White House, right? It's not the policy of the United States demand Bitcoin. So in fact, it's not the policy of anyone in the Western world to band Bitcoin. So the Deniers and the Skeptics are being silenced, and now the entire Bitcoin market is evolving to be controlled by the traders, the technocrats and the maximal list. And clearly, the volatility of the market right now is driven by the fact that the traders are trading Bitcoin as a correlated asset to the NASDAQ. And technology investors that are NASDAQ heavy are selling or shorting technology assets as a risk off trade, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. So I would say that, if we look at the last three months, although the macroeconomic environment is difficult and macroeconomic winds are blowing in the face of all risk assets and all operating companies. I would say the fundamental developments, the political developments and the market awareness of Bitcoin has made enormous strides \u2013 and if you compare where we were today on where we are today versus two years ago, the asset class has matured dramatically, awareness has matured dramatically and the risk of holding the asset class has decreased. And specifically, I think the skeptics in the past 24 months are increasingly disappearing and everyone is migrating to either a trader or a technocrat or a maximus. I had a chance to attend the Bitcoin Conference in Miami Beach this April. I noted a massive surge of interest in bitcoin among politicians, among media and among investors. And there are a lot of politicians that hadn't heard of it and weren't interested in it a year ago, both international and domestic, and now it's on their radar, and they realize they need to pay attention to it.  It's probably not uncorrelated to the executive order of March 9. I think there's a lot more media coverage and we've seen a change in the media tone. I think the media tone two years ago was nonexistent. In fact, people used to lament that Bitcoin was not being covered by mainstream media at all. It wasn't until February of 2021 after Tesla bought Bitcoin that Bitcoin got on to the radar of mainstream media.  But I think that over the past few months, the tone has evolved from skeptical or amused to respectful. And in fact, I almost noticed now that that mainstream journalists across the major papers and the major cable news networks are all much, much more aware of the entire crypto economy, much, much more aware of bitcoin in its value proposition and much less skeptical, much more interested in engage.  And I think the environment has moved from disinterested, through skeptical to now neutrally intrigued or even, I would say, intrigued, intrigued would be the right word in the media. -- also seen a bunch of investors, credible investors that are well respected in the space, speaking much more freely about bitcoin in the marketplace.  And actually, becoming much more vocal and much more supportive in their words. And I think that, that's a big move forward over the past 12 months. Examples of that, we see our Carlos, Salinas, Piaggio becoming much more vocal,  becoming much more vocal. Paul Tudor Jones becoming much more vocal. And Orlando Bravo becoming much more vocal. So, I think you'll continue to see this develop over the next 12 months.  I think advances in the Lightning Network are pretty relevant, maybe one of the bigger developments in the past 12 months is lightening is maturing. And Lightning is the open permissionless non-custodial Layer 2 network. In essence, if Bitcoin represents protocol for sound money, Lightning represents a protocol for transaction and money transfer that's open permissionless. And since it's -- it could, in theory, scale to hundreds of millions or billions of transactions an hour. This is, in essence, the Internet of money. Two years ago, the Lightning network was really just developmental. In the past year, it's come to life. And so we're now entering into early part of the year two of the Internet for money coming to life. Major milestones there, block integrating, lightning into the Cash App was a major milestone. The release of specifications for the Taro protocol on top of Lightning is a major milestone. What it means is that Lightning will in time not just move Satoshis back and forth at the speed of light to billions of people, Lightning will also move other digital assets like stable coins, Tether or a circle or any other digital currency or any other digital token could or an NFC or another asset could move over the Lightning network at extraordinary high speeds, extremely scalable, while taking advantage of the security assurances of the Bitcoin network. So that's pretty compelling. Kraken also incorporated Lightning into their exchange, and that's a very compelling breakthrough. So I think in time, all the competitive digital assets, exchanges and all the competitive applications of money transfer and the like are going to have to build Lightening as a protocol into their applications. And we've got a number of years of development there, but the significance of Lightning is it takes Bitcoin from being viewed just as an asset and as a low frequency, high volume -- a low-frequency, high-value settlement network and it takes it to the next level, which is becoming a high frequency, high volume, very, very functionally rich, scalable transaction network. And there will be, I think, an explosion of applications on top of the Bitcoin network that are empowered by Lightning. Another big development in Bitcoin this last quarter is the launch of Fidelity's 401(k) offering. We're very enthusiastic about that. And of course, we're an early anchor partner with them on that launch. Bitcoin is better than gold. To call it digital gold is an understatement. It really is the hardest money in the history of the world. But if you're thinking about generational wealth and if you wanted to leave something for your grandchildren or if you wanted a retirement fund, it's obviously a very, very compelling element of a 401(k). We just saw just on television today, one of the world's great macro investors, Paul Tudor Jones said, in the current economic environment, I certainly wouldn't be owning stocks and bonds. I mean, people are very skeptical of owning equities and owning bonds in an environment where you have hyperinflation and macroeconomic wins. So if I can't on stocks, and I can't own bonds, and what am I supposed to put in a 401(k)? And this is where Bitcoin comes. What have I wanted to hold some kind of commodity money that's better than a commodity because no one can make any more of it. And Bitcoin is that thing. So I do think that -- the world is evolving rapidly. It's probably evolving faster than regulators and the mainstream media can keep up with it kind of like a shock wave. When you start moving through the civilization at a faster rate than people can educate themselves on the consequences, you'll see sparks, but the 401(k) launch was kind of the shot heard around the world here because what's going on here is people are going to have to stop and think about this and either this is the least risky thing you can put in a retirement portfolio or it's too risky to put in a retirement portfolio. And of course, as soon as you think about it and study it, you'll realize that it's the least risky thing you could put in a retirement portfolio. At least that's the opinion of people that have studied Bitcoin for a while. So the 401(k) offering from Fidelity is a massive educational event. It's going to put this front and center on the table for financial advisers, retirement planners, the entire big finance industry and I think, ultimately, it's going to introduce Bitcoin to an entirely new class of investors and broaden fill the asset class. So, I'd like to move on to talk about our Bitcoin strategy. We're going to continue to pursue a strategy which offers our investors spot exposure with leverage to Bitcoin. So if you want to buy a security and you would like that security to own Bitcoin. And then you would like to -- and you think it would be a reasonable idea to borrow money at 1.8% interest and buy that Bitcoin then MicroStrategy looks like a rational company to invest in. We're going to work to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time in an accretive fashion. So we're not trading Bitcoin, we're not selling Bitcoin we're holding Bitcoin. And from time to time, when we can, we'll buy more Bitcoin. If we focus upon the strategy, then we believe that we can offer a security to the market and be an operating company that, in essence, is superior to the security that you would get if you were to buy a spot ETF. We won't be an ETF. We're an operating company, and we have the software business. But for an investor that's thinking about buying an ETF that holds spot Bitcoin, they'll think about that. It will probably have no leverage, they'll probably pay a fee. And our goal will be to offer them the same Bitcoin holding, but without charging that fee and to use intelligent leverage from time to time when the opportunity presents itself. I was very, very pleased with the Bitcoin backed loan that we were able to acquire this quarter. We'll obviously use that mechanism sparingly because generally, we're not going to want to develop a large set of obligations where we might have to post additional collateral on a price fluctuation of Bitcoin. So managing our balance sheet versus the risk in the volatility of Bitcoin is primary concern. We're always thinking about. We will slow down our Bitcoin acquisitions when market conditions don't present us with any good opportunities. And when the market presents us with lots of good opportunities, we may speed up. And you'll just have to tune in quarter-by-quarter to see what we do there. We have the option to do nothing. And if the market doesn't give us a good option or we have the option to do things. You can see at this point, we've now bought Bitcoin with senior secured debt. We bought Bitcoin with a tender offer. We bought Bitcoin with cash flows from the core business. We bought Bitcoin with convertible debt. We bought Bitcoin with at-the-market equity issuance and we bought Bitcoin with an asset-backed financing. And we pursued each of those initiatives at the time we did it because we thought that they would be accretive to our common stock shareholders and beneficial to our long-term strategy. My last point I'll make before we take questions are; we will continue to pursue a mission of education and advocacy on behalf of Bitcoin to the general market. As the largest public holder of bitcoin, it makes sense for us to educate regulators. It makes sense for us to educate other corporations, it makes sense for us to educate anyone in the media or any politicians that are interested and what this means to the world, and why it's good for the world, why it's good for the United States, why it's good for their corporation, their institution and then how they can benefit and plug Bitcoin into their P&L or plug it into their balance sheet. If you don't follow me on Twitter, please do. I now just cross 2.4 million followers. And I try to share thoughts about the current environment on a pretty routine basis. I'm pleased to say that by the end of the day today or tomorrow, a podcast I did with Lex Friedman on YouTube will have crossed 2 million views. So I sat down with Lex in my study at my home in Miami Beach, and we talked for four hours about digital transformation and the bitcoin imperative. And our strategy and, of course, macroeconomics and geopolitics. And it's not easy to put 2 million people into your living room. But 2 million people listening for 4 hours is a lot of education, and we'll continue to do more of it. I feel that where there's an enormous thirst for knowledge about digital assets. There's enormous thirst for knowledge about the implications of Bitcoin to the world and the entire crypto economy. There's a lot of education to do. We're nowhere near done. We're really just starting, but we have established a platform to do that and we will get more and more opportunities to communicate this message and educate the world.  I'll continue with our efforts working with Bitcoin miners through the Bitcoin Mining Council and the entire Bitcoin community to address misperceptions about mining to explain the benefits of Bitcoin, the benefits of coin mining. We just had another quarterly release of Bitcoin mining information where we were able to show the world for the fourth quarter in a row, Bitcoin mining is running on more than 50% sustainable energy, in fact, 58%. 58% sustainable energy usage makes the Bitcoin mining industry, the cleanest, most sustainable industry in the world of all industries. And that was a surprise to many people. It continues to be a surprise to many people, but it's a delightful surprise. Bitcoin mining in general, is 63% more efficient year-over-year. And a lot of people don't realize that the Bitcoin network is secured, not just by energy, but by technology and that technology is getting exponentially more efficient overtime. So, I'm really pleased that we're able to educate the world on the efficiencies of the Bitcoin network and the benefits of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. I think that there is a lot more education to do. Our leadership role in acquiring and holding bitcoin as a publicly traded company. It's afforded us a platform to do a lot of that education and we'll continue to do that in the coming year. So with that, I want to thank everybody for your support, and we'll go ahead and answer questions.\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. We're going to jump right into questions. We have received a lot of good questions, and we'll try to cover as many as we can. So the first question is for fun. On the software business, clearly, you have been through a few economic cycles over the years, how discretionary is BI software? And do you see the current macro, just pushing deal cycles out or do you think there are certain deals that will be put on hold for a while?\nPhong Le: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jo. The short answer is, there is a portion of BI spend as discretionary and I'll call that speculative, try out new things without necessarily a concrete use case or operational outcome. And then there's a portion that's required and that's the piece that is required to operate and run an enterprise.  And fortunately, MicroStrategy falls more into the latter than the former. So that kind of spending might get pushed out one quarter when there's uncertain macroeconomic conditions like we had in Q1, but it isn't permanently shelved for the whole year or multiple years. So generally speaking, I feel good about our ability to weather macroeconomic downturns better than we've seen in some of our newer competitors who've joined the market recently\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Fang. The next question is for Michael. When you purchase Bitcoin, how much do you consider dollar cost averaging into the purchase during the quarter versus a more OLED once purchase strategy?\nMichael Saylor: Yes. We try to be thoughtful about the way that we acquire Bitcoin, and we do it in such a way that we wouldn't impact the market, and we'll spread it over a time period, sometimes a long time period, sometimes a shorter time period, depending upon our perception of the market and the volatility, as a practical matter because we purchased Bitcoin on many, many different occasions over the past two years, we are dollar cost averaging as we acquire more capital. And I guess I -- that's what I would say to that.\nShirish Jajodia: And one more question for Michael. Are you comfortable with the leverage level? And what is your long-term debt strategy?\nMichael Saylor: Yeah. I think we're comfortable with our leverage level and our long-term debt strategy is not to take on more debt than we can reasonably manage.\nPhong Le: I can add to that a little bit. You saw us share a little bit earlier. Right now, our interest expenses are around $44 million annually, which compared to last year's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, if you were to adjust out the Bitcoin depreciation is about half of that. And so I think we have plenty of earnings and cash flow to cover our interest expense. So we're in a pretty comfortable place right now with our leverage.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you. Next question is for Phong. How far does Bitcoin have to fall for MicroStrategy to receive a margin call on the Silver Gate done? And was this loan needed for cash flow purposes.\nPhong Le: I'll take the second part first. No, the loan was not needed for cash flow purposes. We took out the loan primarily so that we could continue to invest more in Bitcoin and also really to create a market for a Bitcoin-backed term loan. So being the first company to do that in the public markets is consistent with what Mike said, which is really us being a leader in the Bitcoin space in general. As far as where Bitcoin needs to fall, we took out the loan at a 25% LTV, the margin call occurs 50% LTV. So essentially, Bitcoin needs to cut in half or around $21,000 before we'd have a margin call. That said, before it gets to 50%, we could contribute more Bitcoin to the collateral package, so it never gets there, so we don't ever get into a situation of March call also.\nShirish Jajodia: And continue with the next question for Phong as well. Are there any risks of bitcoin collateral being liquidated due to extreme market volatility regarding the Silvergate loan?\nPhong Le: It sort of related to just that last question. The risk of really are that we would have to contribute more bitcoin. As you can see, we mentioned previously, we have quite a bit of uncollateralized bitcoin. So we have 95,643encumbered bitcoin. So we have more that we could contribute in the case that we have a lot of downward volatility. But again, we're talking about $21,000 before we get to a point where there needs to be more margin or more collateral contributors. So I think we're in a pretty comfortable place where we are right now.\nShirish Jajodia: Next question is for Michael. What would be the company's strategy, if the price of Bitcoin stays flat for a prolonged amount of time?\nPhong Le: We'll continue with our strategy. We'll keep generating cash flow in the core business and from time to time, we'll acquire more Bitcoin.\nShirish Jajodia: And I'll follow up one more for Michael. Can MicroStrategy provide any details on exploring the yield generation opportunities on unencumbered macro strategy Bitcoins?\nPhong Le: No.\nShirish Jajodia: Is there anything else on that?\nPhong Le: Yes. I mean we're looking at a lot of different things out there. It's sort of part of our role that we've been playing as a as a leader in the market. But what we're going to do, when we're going to do it, the -- and with deal generation, there is a lot more to it in terms of accounting implications, et cetera. So they are all things we look at from time to time.\nShirish Jajodia: Next question is perform. How did you get comfortable including Bitcoin in your 401(k) program? Can you please provide some details on the plan and whether it's already active?\nPhong Le: Yes. It's similar to the question of how do we get comfortable with Bitcoin in general, right? And Mike talked about this a little bit. First of all, I think it's great what Fidelity is doing as a leader in the market. As one of the leading retirement savings plan providers, it's great to see what they're doing from a leadership perspective. We got comfortable because the executive team, the Board, leadership, employees has spent the last two years learning about studying, understanding details about Bitcoin, especially as a store value, especially as an investment. And so the idea that it's a great long-term historic value, which is why we put so much of our investment into Bitcoin, would make sense for a certain number of employees. It doesn't make sense for everyone and ultimately, it will be something that's voluntary. We have not rolled this out yet. It's something we plan on doing in the second half of the year. And we're still working through details as exactly how we're going to go about it.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Phong. I'll ask one more question for Phong. How much longer do you expect product license revenue to face headwinds, how large will be the segment \u2013 will the segment be by the time it stabilizes?\nPhong Le: Yes. So as we go through this transition to cloud, product license revenues start to decline as we replace that with faster-growing subscription revenues. I can imagine last year was a pretty big increase from the previous year and that we wouldn't expect to see that level of growth on a go-forward basis on a year-over-year basis for product license revenue. As we replace that with cloud and subscription revenues over time, that will be the engine of growth in the organization and our revenue line.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Phong. Next question is for Michael. Can you provide any thoughts into if it's better to buy MicroStrategy stock or the comparison of buying MicroStrategy stock versus buying Bitcoin direct?\nMichael Saylor: I think that there are some companies in some situations where people literally can't buy the Bitcoin like either legally or by charter, they can't buy the Bitcoin, but they can buy securities. There are other situations where people can't or don't wish to buy securities, but they wish to buy property. So there are very different things. One of them is digital property. The other is a security that happens to hold on its balance sheet digital property. So I think that those are the primary issues. For those people that prefer to own securities and their portfolio but want Bitcoin exposure, then will be one of their options. And for those that prefer to own property than Bitcoin's digital property, and I think that's the right way to think of it.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. I think one last question for Phong, is the top-line miss this quarter driven by a faster-than-expected migration to the cloud, or is it a reflection of weaker demand due to macroeconomic risk.\nPhong Le: I think it's more of the latter. And I think that is primarily manifested in slippages of both cloud and perpetual deals into the second quarter. So I don't think this is a permanent change or impact. We do have a little bit of the impact coming from stronger cloud, but I think it's more on the macroeconomic side in the war in Ukraine.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. So I think we are at the top of the time now. So thank you, everyone, for your questions. This concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar. I will now turn the call over to Michael for any closing remarks.\nMichael Saylor: I want to thank everybody for being with us today, and thanks for your support. We wouldn't be here without you. So we'll continue with our strategy, and we look forward to speaking with you again in 12 weeks. Wishing you the best.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you.",

            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. I'm Michael Saylor. I'm the Chairman and CEO of MicroStrategy. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar regarding our 2022 first quarter financial results. I'm here with Phong Le, our President and Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like to pass the floor to Phong, who's going to provide an update on our operations and the financials for the quarter. Thank you, Phong and I want to thank everybody for being with us at here today. I thought I'd start with a few observations of global developments.

I think advances in the Lightning Network are pretty relevant, maybe one of the bigger developments in the past 12 months is lightening is maturing. And Lightning is the open permissionless non-custodial Layer 2 network. In essence, if Bitcoin represents protocol for sound money, Lightning represents a protocol for transaction and money transfer that's open permissionless. And since it's -- it could, in theory, scale to hundreds of millions or billions of transactions an hour. This is, in essence, the Internet of money. Two years ago, the Lightning network was really just developmental. In the past year, it's come to life. And so we're now entering into early part of the year two of the Internet for money coming to life. Major milestones there, block integrating, lightning into the Cash App was a major milestone. The release of specifications for the Taro protocol on top of Lightning is a major milestone. What it means is that Lightning will in time not just move Satoshis back and forth at the speed of light to billions of people, Lightning will also move other digital assets like stable coins, Tether or a circle or any other digital currency or any other digital token could or an NFC or another asset could move over the Lightning network at extraordinary high speeds, extremely scalable, while taking advantage of the security assurances of the Bitcoin network. So that's pretty compelling. Kraken also incorporated Lightning into their exchange, and that's a very compelling breakthrough. So I think in time, all the competitive digital assets, exchanges and all the competitive applications of money transfer and the like are going to have to build Lightening as a protocol into their applications. And we've got a number of years of development there, but the significance of Lightning is it takes Bitcoin from being viewed just as an asset and as a low frequency, high volume -- a low-frequency, high-value settlement network and it takes it to the next level, which is becoming a high frequency, high volume, very, very functionally rich, scalable transaction network. And there will be, I think, an explosion of applications on top of the Bitcoin network that are empowered by Lightning. Another big development in Bitcoin this last quarter is the launch of Fidelity's 401(k) offering. We're very enthusiastic about that. And of course, we're an early anchor partner with them on that launch. Bitcoin is better than gold. To call it digital gold is an understatement. It really is the hardest money in the history of the world. But if you're thinking about generational wealth and if you wanted to leave something for your grandchildren or if you wanted a retirement fund, it's obviously a very, very compelling element of a 401(k). We just saw just on television today, one of the world's great macro investors, Paul Tudor Jones said, in the current economic environment, I certainly wouldn't be owning stocks and bonds. I mean, people are very skeptical of owning equities and owning bonds in an environment where you have hyperinflation and macroeconomic wins. So if I can't on stocks, and I can't own bonds, and what am I supposed to put in a 401(k)? And this is where Bitcoin comes. What have I wanted to hold some kind of commodity money that's better than a commodity because no one can make any more of it. And Bitcoin is that thing. So I do think that -- the world is evolving rapidly. It's probably evolving faster than regulators and the mainstream media can keep up with it kind of like a shock wave. When you start moving through the civilization at a faster rate than people can educate themselves on the consequences, you'll see sparks, but the 401(k) launch was kind of the shot heard around the world here because what's going on here is people are going to have to stop and think about this and either this is the least risky thing you can put in a retirement portfolio or it's too risky to put in a retirement portfolio. And of course, as soon as you think about it and study it, you'll realize that it's the least risky thing you could put in a retirement portfolio. At least that's the opinion of people that have studied Bitcoin for a while. So the 401(k) offering from Fidelity is a massive educational event. It's going to put this front and center on the table for financial advisers, retirement planners, the entire big finance industry and I think, ultimately, it's going to introduce Bitcoin to an entirely new class of investors and broaden fill the asset class. So, I'd like to move on to talk about our Bitcoin strategy. We're going to continue to pursue a strategy which offers our investors spot exposure with leverage to Bitcoin. So if you want to buy a security and you would like that security to own Bitcoin. And then you would like to -- and you think it would be a reasonable idea to borrow money at 1.8% interest and buy that Bitcoin then MicroStrategy looks like a rational company to invest in. We're going to work to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time in an accretive fashion. So we're not trading Bitcoin, we're not selling Bitcoin we're holding Bitcoin. And from time to time, when we can, we'll buy more Bitcoin. If we focus upon the strategy, then we believe that we can offer a security to the market and be an operating company that, in essence, is superior to the security that you would get if you were to buy a spot ETF. We won't be an ETF. We're an operating company, and we have the software business. But for an investor that's thinking about buying an ETF that holds spot Bitcoin, they'll think about that. It will probably have no leverage, they'll probably pay a fee. And our goal will be to offer them the same Bitcoin holding, but without charging that fee and to use intelligent leverage from time to time when the opportunity presents itself. I was very, very pleased with the Bitcoin backed loan that we were able to acquire this quarter. We'll obviously use that mechanism sparingly because generally, we're not going to want to develop a large set of obligations where we might have to post additional collateral on a price fluctuation of Bitcoin. So managing our balance sheet versus the risk in the volatility of Bitcoin is primary concern. We're always thinking about. We will slow down our Bitcoin acquisitions when market conditions don't present us with any good opportunities. And when the market presents us with lots of good opportunities, we may speed up. And you'll just have to tune in quarter-by-quarter to see what we do there. We have the option to do nothing. And if the market doesn't give us a good option or we have the option to do things. You can see at this point, we've now bought Bitcoin with senior secured debt. We bought Bitcoin with a tender offer. We bought Bitcoin with cash flows from the core business. We bought Bitcoin with convertible debt. We bought Bitcoin with at-the-market equity issuance and we bought Bitcoin with an asset-backed financing. And we pursued each of those initiatives at the time we did it because we thought that they would be accretive to our common stock shareholders and beneficial to our long-term strategy. My last point I'll make before we take questions are; we will continue to pursue a mission of education and advocacy on behalf of Bitcoin to the general market. As the largest public holder of bitcoin, it makes sense for us to educate regulators. It makes sense for us to educate other corporations, it makes sense for us to educate anyone in the media or any politicians that are interested and what this means to the world, and why it's good for the world, why it's good for the United States, why it's good for their corporation, their institution and then how they can benefit and plug Bitcoin into their P&L or plug it into their balance sheet. If you don't follow me on Twitter, please do. I now just cross 2.4 million followers. And I try to share thoughts about the current environment on a pretty routine basis. I'm pleased to say that by the end of the day today or tomorrow, a podcast I did with Lex Friedman on YouTube will have crossed 2 million views. So I sat down with Lex in my study at my home in Miami Beach, and we talked for four hours about digital transformation and the bitcoin imperative. And our strategy and, of course, macroeconomics and geopolitics. And it's not easy to put 2 million people into your living room. But 2 million people listening for 4 hours is a lot of education, and we'll continue to do more of it. I feel that where there's an enormous thirst for knowledge about digital assets. There's enormous thirst for knowledge about the implications of Bitcoin to the world and the entire crypto economy. There's a lot of education to do. We're nowhere near done. We're really just starting, but we have established a platform to do that and we will get more and more opportunities to communicate this message and educate the world.  I'll continue with our efforts working with Bitcoin miners through the Bitcoin Mining Council and the entire Bitcoin community to address misperceptions about mining to explain the benefits of Bitcoin, the benefits of coin mining. We just had another quarterly release of Bitcoin mining information where we were able to show the world for the fourth quarter in a row, Bitcoin mining is running on more than 50% sustainable energy, in fact, 58%. 58% sustainable energy usage makes the Bitcoin mining industry, the cleanest, most sustainable industry in the world of all industries. And that was a surprise to many people. It continues to be a surprise to many people, but it's a delightful surprise. Bitcoin mining in general, is 63% more efficient year-over-year. And a lot of people don't realize that the Bitcoin network is secured, not just by energy, but by technology and that technology is getting exponentially more efficient overtime. So, I'm really pleased that we're able to educate the world on the efficiencies of the Bitcoin network and the benefits of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining. I think that there is a lot more education to do. Our leadership role in acquiring and holding bitcoin as a publicly traded company. It's afforded us a platform to do a lot of that education and we'll continue to do that in the coming year. So with that, I want to thank everybody for your support, and we'll go ahead and answer questions. Yes. We try to be thoughtful about the way that we acquire Bitcoin, and we do it in such a way that we wouldn't impact the market, and we'll spread it over a time period, sometimes a long time period, sometimes a shorter time period, depending upon our perception of the market and the volatility, as a practical matter because we purchased Bitcoin on many, many different occasions over the past two years, we are dollar cost averaging as we acquire more capital. And I guess I -- that's what I would say to that. Yeah. I think we're comfortable with our leverage level and our long-term debt strategy is not to take on more debt than we can reasonably manage. I think that there are some companies in some situations where people literally can't buy the Bitcoin like either legally or by charter, they can't buy the Bitcoin, but they can buy securities. There are other situations where people can't or don't wish to buy securities, but they wish to buy property. So there are very different things. One of them is digital property. The other is a security that happens to hold on its balance sheet digital property. So I think that those are the primary issues. For those people that prefer to own securities and their portfolio but want Bitcoin exposure, then will be one of their options. And for those that prefer to own property than Bitcoin's digital property, and I think that's the right way to think of it. I want to thank everybody for being with us today, and thanks for your support. We wouldn't be here without you. So we'll continue with our strategy, and we look forward to speaking with you again in 12 weeks. Wishing you the best."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. We continue to be pleased across both our corporate strategies in the first quarter of 2022. Here is a summary of our first quarter software results. Revenues declined 3% year-over-year and were flat on a constant currency basis. We saw some revenue headwinds in Q1. This included a more challenging macroeconomic environment due to war in Ukraine, a tough comparison in Q1 2021, where we saw license revenue grow 69% and total revenue grow 10% year-over-year, and ongoing cloud growth, which has a short-term negative impact on product license and total revenue. Our cloud business continues its momentum with subscription revenue growing 28% year-over-year and current subscription billings growing 18% year-over-year, our eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth. We had several large cloud deals slipped from Q1 due to macroeconomic uncertainty, which caused billings growth to decline sequentially. Turning now to our Bitcoin strategy. We had another active and successful quarter. We purchased $215 million of Bitcoin at an average purchase price of $44,645 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. We have not sold any bitcoin to-date. These purchases were funded by excess cash in our business as well as through a $205 million first-ever public company Bitcoin back term loan. I'll discuss the terms of the loan in more detail in our financial section. In total, we have raised an aggregate of $3.4 billion in new debt and equity capital that we've deployed in support of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy. To reiterate our strategy, we seek to acquire and hold Bitcoin long term. We view our Bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings and we do not currently plan to engage in sales of Bitcoin. As of March 31, 2022, the company own an aggregate of 129,218 bitcoins that we acquired for a total cost of $3.97 billion or $30,700 per Bitcoin, net of fees and expenses. The market value of our Bitcoin holdings was $5.9 billion at March 31, 2022 reflecting $1.9 billion of unrealized gains or nearly 50% appreciation when compared to the original cost basis of our bitcoin at March 31, 2022. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of March 31, 2022, was roughly $2.9 billion, reflecting $1.1 billion in cumulative impairment charges. We continue to see opportunities for MicroStrategy to target a multibillion-dollar software market that is at an early stage of moving off of legacy tech into the cloud. We're well positioned to meet the demands of enterprise customers with our modern analytics platform.  As we discussed in detail on our last earnings call, we see three key areas of growth for us: enterprise analytics, embedded analytics and cloud, where we will seek to grow by developing our pipeline, making our customers successful and continuing to innovate, automate and simplify our technology stack.  Next, I would like to provide you an update on the product enhancements in our latest platform release, which expands the value provided to our customers and represents future incremental growth opportunities. In particular, the product now includes an impressive differentiated set of new capabilities that enable organizations to build seamless, scalable business intelligence applications at a faster pace, either deployed stand-alone or embedded directly into other products. With a fully modern, immersive and interactive design even introduce a simple no-code application development option built on the foundation of MicroStrategy Library, built to empower developers to deploy powerful customized data portals for multiple user groups at enterprise scale and a rapid speed to market. MicroStrategy applications bring a competitive edge to our customers.  Developers can build one app for employees using iPads on the sales floor and another for finance executives and headquarters, all based on the same highly governed single version of the truth. This delivers greater trust, less hassle and lower maintenance costs. All qualities that make MicroStrategy the ideal partner for enterprises and independent software providers. Applications also provide enhanced tolerable security controls to grant limited access and log in, as well as sophisticated embedding functionality for extended flexibility and customization. Speaking of security, MicroStrategy also separated itself from the competition recently by way of our fast, transparent and effective response to the high-profile Log4j and Spring for Shell on their abilities.  Our customers benefited from rapid mitigation and remediation of these issues, solidifying the peace of mind they have come to expect from our partnership. Those customer of MicroStrategy cloud has 0-day fixes installed over the weekend and updates and patches installed in a week.  MicroStrategy continues to be growing, a growing part of the mix. MicroStrategy Cloud continues to be a growing part of the mix of our business. We are on track to accelerate the subscription billings momentum in 2022. We expect to grow by migrating on-prem customers to the cloud, expanding the footprint for existing cloud customers, and defaulting deployment of as many new customers as possible to the cloud. We also expect to have our MicroStrategy FedRAMP-compliant version of our software available in Q3 this year. For those customers that are not yet ready to move to cloud, such as those in highly regulated industries or countries, we remain committed to supporting them also. Our underlying cloud architecture is also improving, leveraging containers and micro services. This architecture is built to deliver highly scalable multi-tenant SaaS solutions across tens of thousands of users and provide developers with a streamlined experience to leverage continuous integration and continuous development. Overall, I'm very pleased with the pace of product innovation and we are confident in our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets while maintaining profitability. Finally, our Annual User Conference, MicroStrategy World, was another tremendous success. World 22 was our second virtual world event and enable us to reach a bigger, broader audience with customer success stories, product presentations, thought leadership keynotes, and a hugely popular Bitcoin for Corporations Event held in tandem. Our content was available to all for free via an online event platform. The key notes, including the Michael Saylor, Jack Dorsey keynote were simulcast live on YouTube. All-in-all, we had nearly 14,000 registrants on the event platform and over 180,000 viewers of the content across all mediums. Replays for the sessions are available on our website. Turning to our first quarter 2022 financial results in more detail. Revenues for the quarter were $119.3 million, down 3% year-over-year were almost flat on a constant currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, total revenues are up 3% year-over-year. Product license revenues were $16.5 million, down 22% year-over-year or down 20% on a constant currency basis. The decline is mainly due to a large transaction included in Q1 2021 and that contributed the majority of the year-over-year differential. On a trailing 12-month basis, product license revenues are up 2% year-over-year. Subscription services revenues were $12.8 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year or up 30% on a constant currency basis. The growth in subscription services revenues reflects the increased portion of our product bookings that are related to our managed cloud platform. Our current subscription billings in the first quarter of 2021 were $11.4 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. The growth was lower than expected for the first quarter as some deals slipped out of the first quarter, in part, caused by the ongoing war in Ukraine, impacting the purchasing patterns of customers in Europe and worldwide. We see strong demand and pipeline for our cloud licenses and the potential for our future for further growth going forward. Product support revenues were $67.2 million in the quarter, a decrease of 5% year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis. The decline was partially driven by certain existing customers converting from perpetual product licenses to our subscription services or term licenses offerings and partially by an impact from unfavorable foreign currency exchange. As we see more on-premise conversions to our cloud offering, we would anticipate product support revenues will experience a modest decline over time. That said, our in-quarter product support renewal rates for Q1 continue to be among the highest we've ever experienced. Finally, other services revenues, which largely reflect our consulting services, were $22.8 million in this quarter, an increase of 9% year-over-year or 13% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in billable hours worldwide, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact and a decrease in average billing rates. We believe that growth in consulting revenues is an indication of continued engagement from our customers to modernize, retain and grow their deployment of the MicroStrategy platform. Shifting to our cost. Total non-GAAP expenses include share-based compensation expenses, were $275 million, which excludes share-based compensation expenses, were $275 million in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to $298 million in the first quarter of 2021. Of this amount, $170 million were bitcoin impairment charges in Q1 2022 and $194 million in Q1 2021. As a reminder, on the treatment of bitcoin impairment charges, our bitcoin holdings are considered indefinite-lived intangible assets under applicable accounting rules, meaning that any decrease in their fair value below our carrying value for such assets at any time subsequent to their acquisition requires us to recognize impairment charges. During the first quarter, we incurred digital asset impairment charges of $170 million. As discussed on the last earnings call, on a go-forward basis, any non-GAAP financial measures we may present in future filings will retain the impact from bitcoin impairment charges. This change in the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures does not impact our strategy, operations or GAAP financial statements or previous SEC filings. We'll continue to report the bitcoin impairment charges separately. Now, starting from the bottom of the chart moving up. Non-GAAP cost of revenues were $25 million in the first quarter of 2022, an increase of $2.4 million or 11% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues, this reflects an increase of 2.6%, driven by increases in cloud customer hosting fees and personnel costs from additional headcount. As we continue to accelerate our shift to cloud, we expect increases in infrastructure costs and headcount to support additional customers. And over time, for our cloud business to scale, decreasing costs as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $29 million, a decrease of $6.9 million or 19% year-over-year. The decline is primarily driven by a decrease in variable compensation, mainly due to higher capitalized commissions and decreases in bonus and personnel costs. As a percentage of product license and subscription revenue, the charge reflects a decrease -- the change reflects a decrease of 16%, which in part reflects improved productivity of our sales and marketing teams. Non-GAAP research and development expense was $30 million, an increase of $2.8 million or 10% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, this reflects an increase of 3%, driven by headcount increases, cost of hiring and wage inflation. The technology sector has experienced significant wage inflation and competition for resources, and we anticipate that trend will continue in 2022 and that we'll continue to invest in R&D to retain our talented engineers and develop sophisticated innovative products. We're also shifting some headcount to lower-cost regions, which we expect will result in some cost efficiencies over time. Non-GAAP general and administrative expense was $21 million, an increase of $2.1 million or 11% year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue. This reflects an increase of 2.3%. Overall, we feel comfortable with our cost structure and our ability to generate cash flow sustainably. Total non-GAAP operating loss in the first quarter of 2022 was $155.6 million, inclusive of impairment charge related to Bitcoin and $170.1 million. The carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings as of March 31, 2022, was $2.9 billion, which reflects $1.1 billion in cumulative impairment charges have also been reflected as losses on our GAAP income statements in the period incurred. Our non-cash Bitcoin impairment charges will remain subject to market volatility of Bitcoin market prices. As one of the leading advocates for digital assets, we've been working with peer companies and various policy setting agencies in the US to try to develop an alternative accounting framework for digital assets. Currently, companies that aren't investment companies report Bitcoin as intangible assets. This means Bitcoin is initially recorded on balance sheet, so that is the store cost and then is deemed impaired at the market price of the company's principal exchange for Bitcoin drops below the carrying value at any time. However, the carrying value can never conversely be revised upward at the price of Bitcoin increases. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, announced that it had added a project to their research agenda to explore accounting for exchange-traded digital assets. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, we believe we have a responsibility to share what we've learned since embarked on this strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this new asset class. Next, I'll discuss the terms of our first ever Bitcoin backed term loan with Silvergate Bank. We raised $205 million as an interest-only loan for a term of three years, which is collateralized by Bitcoin. The loan matures on March 23, 2025. It bears monthly interest at a floating rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or SOFR, 30-day average as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website plus 3.70% with a floor of 3.75%. The low may be prepaid at any time, subject to modest prepayment premiums. The loan had an initial loan to collateral value of 25%, which was thus collateralized closing by Bitcoin with a value of approximately $820 million. While the loan is outstanding, we are required to maintain an LTV ratio of 50% or less. Which essentially allows for an approximately 50% drop of Bitcoin prices from the time of transaction closing before we're required to post any incremental collateral. We're also allowed to proactively manage the LTV ratio by posting any desired value of additional collateral, if we choose to. If Bitcoin appreciates in price and the LTV ratio is less than 25% at any time, we're entitled a return of excess collateral so long as the LTV ratio would not exceed 25% after such. Additionally, we have established a $5 million cash reserve account with Silvergate to serve as additional collateral for the loan that can be used towards the interest payments for the last six months of the long-term. Also, we have held back approximately $9 million from the loan proceeds as cash and macro strategy that can be used towards general corporate purposes, including paying interest for this loan or buying additional Bitcoin. This loan is not guaranteed by any party. The agreement does not restrict us from incurring additional debt, permits additional lean so long as such liens are not on the asset serving as collateral for the loan, and permits us to sell assets so long as they are not serving as collateral for the loan. There are no restrictions on utilizing Bitcoin that is not a part of the collateral for this loan. Thus, this loan would be accretive to shareholders. As long as Bitcoin appreciates, more than the issue expense and cumulative interest expense to be occurred -- incurred over the term of the loan. MicroStrategy has pioneered the use of digital assets as a core component of enterprise's treasury policy, which has generated incremental value for our shareholders, as a snapshot into our current Bitcoin holdings by entities, as of March 31, 2022, of the total of 129,218 Bitcoins held by the company. Roughly 14,100 Bitcoins are held at the MicroStrategy entity, all of which are held as collateral securing our 2028 secured notes. The remaining approximately 115,100 Bitcoins are held at the MacroStrategy subsidiary. Of the MacroStrategy of Bitcoins, approximately 19,500 Bitcoins are pledges collateral towards the Bitcoin back term loan and over 95,600 Bitcoins remain unpledged and unencumbered. We may consider additional opportunities to utilize the strategic asset in the future. For example, subject to market conditions, we may enter into additional bitcoin back financings, we seek to lend our Bitcoin to third parties to generate yield. We will continue to closely monitor market conditions and determine whether to engage in any such transactions and may ultimately decide not to pursue any of these transactions. Next, I would like to emphasize the strength of our robust capital structure. From a balance sheet and liquidity perspective, we're insulated from the near-term market volatility at Bitcoin prices, since we currently do not have any debt principal maturities coming due until March 2025. The total annualized interest expense today is approximately $44 million, which equates to a blended interest rate of approximately 1.82% on our entire debt obligations of $2.4 billion. We expect cash flows generated from our software business to be sufficient to cover interest obligations, as they become payable. Additionally, we maintain a certain minimum amount of cash balance to fund our regular working capital needs. As of the first quarter, we had $95 million in cash on our balance sheet. Going forward, we'll continue to evaluate debt or equity capital raising and other financing opportunities that we believe will be accretive to shareholders, subject to market conditions and that further our Bitcoin acquisition strategy or optimize our capital structure is needed. We believe that the further adoption of Bitcoin globally will have a positive effect on Bitcoin prices, which has the potential to offer asymmetric upside to our shareholders. Our 2022 outlook remains positive with our continued transition to cloud and our expectation of a sustained increase in subscription billings. Our cloud transition will result in increased subscription revenue and billings. With the continued growth of our subscription billings, it is possible that our product license revenue and total revenue growth will decelerate in the near term, even as our cloud software business -- even as our overall software business expense. This will depend largely on the mix of new sales between cloud and on-premise licenses. This is because of a new cloud contract, which may have a higher total contract value than an on-premise license still results in lower recognized revenue in the first year. Overall, we feel we are well positioned to achieve our long-term sales growth target of greater than 10% and increased free cash flows over time. Finally, I'd like to share an update with you regarding the appointment of our new CFO. I'd like to welcome Andrew Kang, who will be joining MicroStrategy as our new CFO effective on a start date, which we expect to be on or around May 9. I'm thrilled to see him step into this new critical leadership role where he will be able to contribute from his wealth of experience. Andrew has over 20 years of experience in banking and consumer finance and most recently served as CFO for GreenSky, Inc., a publicly-traded fintech company. Prior to GreenSky, Andrew served as the Corporate Treasurer for Santander Holdings USA, the $150 billion US bank holding company under Banco Santander SA. Andrew has also held leadership positions in capital markets, finance, and treasury at Santander Consumer USA, HSBC Finance, and Capital One. Following Andrew's appointment, I look forward to having more time to focus on my role as President, running the day-to-day operations of MicroStrategy as well as strategically planning for our long-term health and growth for both BI and Bitcoin strategies. I'll now turn the call over to Michael to discuss observations for the MicroStrategy World Event, comments on our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, as well as regulatory outlook for the digital asset space. Yes. Thanks for the question, Jo. The short answer is, there is a portion of BI spend as discretionary and I'll call that speculative, try out new things without necessarily a concrete use case or operational outcome. And then there's a portion that's required and that's the piece that is required to operate and run an enterprise.  And fortunately, MicroStrategy falls more into the latter than the former. So that kind of spending might get pushed out one quarter when there's uncertain macroeconomic conditions like we had in Q1, but it isn't permanently shelved for the whole year or multiple years. So generally speaking, I feel good about our ability to weather macroeconomic downturns better than we've seen in some of our newer competitors who've joined the market recently I can add to that a little bit. You saw us share a little bit earlier. Right now, our interest expenses are around $44 million annually, which compared to last year's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, if you were to adjust out the Bitcoin depreciation is about half of that. And so I think we have plenty of earnings and cash flow to cover our interest expense. So we're in a pretty comfortable place right now with our leverage. I'll take the second part first. No, the loan was not needed for cash flow purposes. We took out the loan primarily so that we could continue to invest more in Bitcoin and also really to create a market for a Bitcoin-backed term loan. So being the first company to do that in the public markets is consistent with what Mike said, which is really us being a leader in the Bitcoin space in general. As far as where Bitcoin needs to fall, we took out the loan at a 25% LTV, the margin call occurs 50% LTV. So essentially, Bitcoin needs to cut in half or around $21,000 before we'd have a margin call. That said, before it gets to 50%, we could contribute more Bitcoin to the collateral package, so it never gets there, so we don't ever get into a situation of March call also. It sort of related to just that last question. The risk of really are that we would have to contribute more bitcoin. As you can see, we mentioned previously, we have quite a bit of uncollateralized bitcoin. So we have 95,643encumbered bitcoin. So we have more that we could contribute in the case that we have a lot of downward volatility. But again, we're talking about $21,000 before we get to a point where there needs to be more margin or more collateral contributors. So I think we're in a pretty comfortable place where we are right now. We'll continue with our strategy. We'll keep generating cash flow in the core business and from time to time, we'll acquire more Bitcoin. No. Yes. I mean we're looking at a lot of different things out there. It's sort of part of our role that we've been playing as a as a leader in the market. But what we're going to do, when we're going to do it, the -- and with deal generation, there is a lot more to it in terms of accounting implications, et cetera. So they are all things we look at from time to time. Yes. It's similar to the question of how do we get comfortable with Bitcoin in general, right? And Mike talked about this a little bit. First of all, I think it's great what Fidelity is doing as a leader in the market. As one of the leading retirement savings plan providers, it's great to see what they're doing from a leadership perspective. We got comfortable because the executive team, the Board, leadership, employees has spent the last two years learning about studying, understanding details about Bitcoin, especially as a store value, especially as an investment. And so the idea that it's a great long-term historic value, which is why we put so much of our investment into Bitcoin, would make sense for a certain number of employees. It doesn't make sense for everyone and ultimately, it will be something that's voluntary. We have not rolled this out yet. It's something we plan on doing in the second half of the year. And we're still working through details as exactly how we're going to go about it. Yes. So as we go through this transition to cloud, product license revenues start to decline as we replace that with faster-growing subscription revenues. I can imagine last year was a pretty big increase from the previous year and that we wouldn't expect to see that level of growth on a go-forward basis on a year-over-year basis for product license revenue. As we replace that with cloud and subscription revenues over time, that will be the engine of growth in the organization and our revenue line. I think it's more of the latter. And I think that is primarily manifested in slippages of both cloud and perpetual deals into the second quarter. So I don't think this is a permanent change or impact. We do have a little bit of the impact coming from stronger cloud, but I think it's more on the macroeconomic side in the war in Ukraine."

With that, I will turn the call over to Phong Le, President and CEO of MicroStrategy.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar. I want to start by providing an update on the state of the company and achievements over the past year. Today, MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world, holding 190,000 bitcoins with a total bitcoin market value of $8.1 billion as of yesterday. In 2023, we acquired 56,650 bitcoins for a total purchase cost of $1.9 billion, an average price of $33,580. In 2024 so far, we've acquired an additional 850 bitcoins for a total purchase cost of $37 million. Over the past year, we've seen bitcoin mature further as an institutional-grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption. We remain highly committed to our Bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus. Andrew will provide further details on our Bitcoin purchase activity for this quarter later. MicroStrategy is also positioned as the world's largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company. Our objective is to grow in AI and cloud-powered BI software. We have over 1,900 employees focused on our software business, devoted to achieving our vision of intelligence everywhere. The past year has marked the most transformative in our 25-year history of being a public company as we released MicroStrategy ONE, MicroStrategy AI, MicroStrategy Cloud for Azure, AWS, and now the Google Cloud platform and continue to focus on growth in both cloud and AI plus BI. In 2023, we made important progress in our shift towards our cloud offering resulting in annual subscription services revenue of $81.2 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. The strong growth in our subscription services revenue was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer renewal rates continue to be among the highest we've ever experienced, and our subscription billings remain strong. Overall, we continue to see further global adoption of our cloud platform as a result of transitioning our business strategy and product offerings from an on-prem perpetual license software company to a cloud native organization. Further, we've transformed the way we function as an organization. We've reorganized and invested in our go-to-market approach to help develop sales opportunities, convert more customers to our cloud offering. We've created a customer success function to focus on the customer experience, including onboarding, adoption, retention, migration, and upsell. This enables our sales teams to focus on selling to new customers in the cloud. We've revised our sales compensation plans to prioritize new business and cloud transactions. We've rebuilt our marketing leadership team and have invested in product marketing, field enablement, brand development, and demand generation. We have expanded our partner sales channel with strategic partnerships with Microsoft, AWS, Google, and Snowflake, harnessing thousands of eager sellers ready to deploy MicroStrategy on their platforms. I believe MicroStrategy is entering 2024 stronger than ever and will continue to provide a unique value proposition for our shareholders. With our bitcoin strategy being so significant to our overall business value, while we also continue to pursue growth in our enterprise analytics business, some may ask, what kind of a company is MicroStrategy now? It's a fair question and a question that takes on even more significance with the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETPs in the United States. We consider MicroStrategy to be unique. We consider MicroStrategy to be the world's first bitcoin development company. Let me explain what we mean. We are a publicly traded operating company committed to the continued development of the bitcoin network through activities in the financial markets, advocacy, and technology innovation. As an operating business, we're able to use cash flows as well as proceeds from equity and debt financing to accumulate bitcoin, which serve as our primary treasury reserve asset. We also develop and provide industry leading AI powered enterprise analytics software that promotes our vision of intelligence everywhere and are also using our software development capabilities to develop bitcoin applications. We believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for value creation. Being an operating company, our software business remains our core revenue and cash flow generator. In addition, it also enables us to acquire bitcoin through the use of excess cash or proceeds from equity capital raises or corporate debt capital raises and to pursue software innovations that leverage the bitcoin blockchain. We've deployed these levers to increase our bitcoin holdings in a manner which we believe has created shareholder value. Bitcoin development includes our bitcoin acquisition strategy and bitcoin advocacy initiatives. Our software development includes BI, AI, Cloud, or Bitcoin and Lightning related software development. Let me elaborate on our 2024 software strategic focus. In 2024, we will continue our transformation focus to wane and grow in AI plus BI, while accelerating our transition to a cloud-centric operating model. Our key strategic goals are to grow cloud, innovate with AI, and increase profitability. So first, let me cover growing with cloud. MicroStrategy Cloud is a key area of our research and development efforts as we expand our platform's flexibility, scalability, and security. In December, we successfully deployed our Google Cloud platform integration, furthering our multi-cloud capabilities, providing greater optionality to our customers. This offering is microservices and container-based and uses our most recent cloud innovations. As of today, MicroStrategy can be deployed and fully hosted on Azure, AWS, and GCP. Additionally, we'll provide the ability to automate deployment of MicroStrategy with many of the same benefits of a public cloud, but in a private cloud later this year. This distinguishes us from other BI platforms with the flexibility and automation that enterprise customers require. We believe such investment and capability will encourage current on-premise customers to embrace the benefits of MicroStrategy Cloud, such as containerized architecture, proactive cloud management from experts, seamless backups, and single click updates. Transitioning our customer base to the technology of the future remains a key focus, and our resource deployment underscores our commitment to the cloud first approach. As customers and prospects move to the cloud to empower their AI-driven digital transformations, we expect a decrease in product license revenues. This will in part be offset by increases in subscription services revenues in the same year and will be more than offset with higher recurring revenues in the following years. This will be most pronounced in 2024 as we expect to increase the pace of cloud adoption. Besides more healthy recurring revenues, additional benefits of moving customers and prospects to cloud include more engaged and happy customers using our latest software, resulting in higher retention rates. The second area of focus for our software business is to innovate with AI. We will continue to focus on product innovation and AI-powered BI in the cloud. In September, MicroStrategy released its most innovative product to date, MicroStrategy AI. Our innovative, first-to-market AI solution offers capabilities designed to deliver an exceptional user experience on trusted data, featuring out of the box resources that streamline adoption on our multi-cloud platform. The initial reception from customers has been positive. Our platform's AI/BI capabilities enable customers to automate their BI workflows, including building data wrangling, dashboard creation, and data exploration. This elevates the role of data throughout the organization, allowing companies to make better database decisions and take actions. We believe that our continued thought leadership and innovation focus in the AI plus BI intersection will serve as a growth catalyst for MicroStrategy into the future. As business continues to search for efficiencies to reduce cost, increase productivity, and increase revenues, AI solutions and trusted data will continue to gain prevalence as a necessity. In addition, in December, we released our standalone bot feature as an extension of our MicroStrategy AI capabilities. With the release of build your own bot, MicroStrategy has entered the adjacent bot market with the capabilities and pedigree of our BI product to address a wide range of use cases. When considering the services currently offered in the bot market, we noticed customer demand for a bot builder that addresses [GenAI] (ph) resource constraints, improves structured data processing, and solving for the lack of enterprise trust provided by current LLM solutions. The current landscape of bot offerings, such as domain-specific bots, LLM, customizations, and flexible build bots either lack the flexibility to address broad use cases or face limitations with structured data. MicroStrategy bots are one of the easiest to use products we've ever developed. Combining our structured data horsepower with our open AI integrated LLM capabilities, we've created an AI bot flexible enough to support any industry vertical or departmental scenario with trusted analytics. Leveraging the MicroStrategy platform's advanced capabilities in the enterprise such as security, governance, integration with third-party tools, and system auditability, we enable customers to easily deploy chatbots for broad use on trusted data. The third area of focus for our software business is to increase profitability. We will continue to optimize our internal organizational structure in 2024. This means being mindful of financial objectives when choosing investment areas, collapse in organizational layers to improve internal velocity, reducing our dependence on low margin consulting in favor of external partners, and leverage our leadership team to guide both strategy and execution to deliver increased profitability. For 2024, operating goals for our software business are to increase overall top-line revenue compared to 2023 and target non-GAAP operating income, excluding impairment losses of $70 million to $90 million. Increased profitability would further enable us to increase our bitcoin holdings. As a bitcoin development company, we're focused on generating value for our stockholders by using various capital markets and technology levers. As an operating company, we can make use of intelligent leverage. Since our adoption of our bitcoin strategy, we've used three primary mechanisms to acquire more bitcoin. One, cash flow from software operations. Since August 2020, we've invested $726 million of total cash on our balance sheet in bitcoin. Two, equity issuances. We have issued $3.1 billion in equity in a manner that we believe to be accretive to existing shareholders to acquire bitcoin. And three, debt financing. We've obtained $2.2 billion in corporate debt proceeds through the issuance of both senior secured notes and convertible notes that we use to purchase bitcoin. The blended cost of our debt is fixed at 1.6% annually. We believe each of these techniques and our unique positioning as the world's first bitcoin development company have enabled us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. And thank you all for joining. I'll first start with our software financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $124.5 million, down 6% year-over-year. For the full year, total revenues were $496.3 million, down slightly 1% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating results were mixed with a decline in year-over-year revenues, in part due to the ongoing revenue shift to cloud and the lingering macroeconomic headwinds impacting overall customer spend. Product license revenues were $18.4 million, which was down 33% year-over-year in Q4, and $75.4 million, down about 13% year-over-year for the full year. However, as we transition our business to the cloud, we fully anticipate lower product license revenues as we migrate both existing and new customers to the cloud. More importantly, we continue to grow subscription services revenues which reflect the recurring revenues from our expanding cloud business. In Q4, subscription services revenues were $21.5 million, which is an increase of 23% year-over-year, and $81.2 million for the full year, an increase of 34% year-over-year. Current subscription billings, which reflect new cloud bookings, grew 33% in the fourth quarter to $41.3 million and $94.8 million for the full year, a 23% increase year-over-year, which was our 15th straight quarter of double digit growth in cloud bookings. Q4 was an important milestone for us, where for the first time in both Q4 and for the full year, our subscription services revenues were higher than our product license revenues. This was a significant achievement to show the continued progress in our transition to stronger recurring revenues in the cloud. As I mentioned before, we expect the mix of revenue will continue to shift from product license to subscription services revenues in 2024 as we focus on delivering AI-based products to our customers in the cloud. Moving to costs, total non-GAAP expenses were $148 million in the fourth quarter, 52% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Bitcoin impairment charges for the quarter were $39 million compared to $198 million in Q4 of last year. Total non-GAAP expenses excluding bitcoin impairment were $108 million in the fourth quarter down 3% year-over-year. While we're spending more on cloud hosting costs as we grow our cloud business, we have been able to offset those increases with cost reductions in corporate overhead and while optimizing headcount, which was down 10% year-over-year. We reported a total non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter of $23 million, of which, the loss on the bitcoin impairment was $39 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $89 million, which included a $150 million tax benefit, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset, directly related to our bitcoin holdings. And at the end of Q4, fair market value of bitcoin as of December 31st was above our aggregate cost basis, resulting in a release of the previously established valuation allowance and a corresponding non-cash tax provision benefit. Turning to our bitcoin strategy, we had an extremely successful Q4 adding more bitcoin to our holdings, acquiring 30,905 bitcoins in the quarter, the largest single quarter bitcoin holdings increase since Q4 of 2020. After the end of the quarter, we purchased an additional 850 bitcoins using $37 million of excess cash. And as of February 5th, 2024, the company held a total of 190,000 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate cost of $5.93 billion, or $31,224 per bitcoin. Bitcoins purchased through excess cash from the software business are held at MicroStrategy, the parent entity, and are secured under our 2028 secured notes. As of yesterday, there were 16,931 bitcoins held at MicroStrategy. Bitcoins acquired through proceeds from capital markets activities after the issuance of our senior secured notes, which include equity and debt issuances, are held at MacroStrategy, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy. We hold 173,069 bitcoins, representing 91% of our total bitcoin holdings or over $7.3 billion in current market value at the MacroStrategy level, all of which are currently unrestricted and unencumbered, providing us with optionality to potentially leverage this strategic asset in the future. In Q4, we purchased a total of 30,555 bitcoins for $1.2 billion using net proceeds from our ATM program. As noted a moment ago, these bitcoins are held at MacroStrategy and remain unencumbered. In Q4, we also purchased an additional 350 bitcoins for $13.4 million using excess cash from operations, which are held at MicroStrategy. And subsequently, in January 2024, we used additional excess cash from operations to purchase an additional 850 bitcoins for $37 million, which are also held at MicroStrategy. Our commitment to our bitcoin strategy remains unchanged and unwavering, and we plan to add more bitcoin over time using our excess cash from operations, as well as proceeds from any capital markets activities. MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world and we have remained committed to our bitcoin acquisition strategy with the highest conviction, with a consistent track record, long-term focus, and a strong risk managed approach to acquiring and holding more bitcoin on our balance sheet. Turning to Slide 15, we saw bitcoin outperform the US equity markets in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our bitcoin holdings is approximately $3.6 billion compared to approximately $8 billion in market value based on the bitcoin price as of the last day of the quarter. Year to date, the market value of our bitcoin holdings is approximately $8.1 billion, which is significantly above our average purchase price of approximately $31,200. In late December, FASB approved a change in accounting rules for certain digital assets, including bitcoin, to be measured using fair value accounting. We are delighted by FASB's expeditious move to create more transparent reporting, and we are encouraged by the continuing maturity of the regulatory environment surrounding bitcoin and we hope these enhanced accounting rules will serve as a positive on-ramp for other corporates to adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve. The new accounting rule requires companies holding digital assets, including bitcoin, to adopt fair value accounting treatment by Q1 of 2025. And while we have not yet elected to early adopt the new accounting standard, which was only just finalized late in the fourth quarter, we continue to evaluate the timing along with accounting and tax impacts of adoption. If we elect to adopt the new accounting standard in 2024, we estimate that our 2024 beginning bitcoin holdings value would be marked up to a fair value of approximately $8 billion as of January 1st, 2024. As Phong mentioned earlier, we have effectively used excess cash flows to grow our bitcoin holdings. At the inception of our bitcoin balance sheet strategy in 2020, we allocated a substantial portion of our cash reserves generated over many previous years into bitcoin, acquiring over 43,000 Bitcoin for $595 million. Beyond that initial acquisition, we have continued to acquire an average of $40 million of bitcoin each year with excess cash on our balance sheet, totaling approximately 3,500 bitcoins since 2022. Our ability to leverage cash from operations enables us to increase our bitcoin holdings in a manner that we believe is accretive to our shareholders. And in total, we have issued approximately $726 million of excess cash to acquire more bitcoin, accounting for approximately 48,000 bitcoin added to our balance sheet, or about 25% of our total bitcoin holdings. Now turning to our capital markets activities, also since the inception of our bitcoin strategy, we have raised $2.2 billion of debt through senior secured notes and convertible notes with an attractive blended interest rate of approximately 1.6%, with the earliest maturity not until 2025. Leverage remains a key component of our active capital management strategy, which when intelligently deployed enables us to accrete more bitcoin on our balance sheet at an attractive cost. We will continue to actively monitor the capital markets, evaluating liability management opportunities to manage our debt maturities as well as opportunities to raise additional debt in the future. In addition to raising debt, we have demonstrated a solid track record of issuing permanent equity capital in a manner that we believe has been accretive to our shareholders. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have raised a total of $3.1 billion in proceeds through our at-the-market or ATM programs, with the average price of approximately $457 per share across total equity raised. In Q4 of last year, we accelerated the execution of our current ATM program and raised $1.2 billion in aggregate net proceeds. And in Q4 alone, we issued approximately 2.27 million shares of Class A common stock [indiscernible] approximately $138 million of capacity remaining under our current program. As we have done in the past, we will continue to carefully evaluate the most accretive use of proceeds from the sale of equity to be incremental value for our shareholders. The primary use of proceeds from the sale of equity to date has been to acquire additional bitcoin. But we also use proceeds of our ATM program to prepay the $250 million bitcoin back loan in Q1 of 2023, which generated a $45 million gain on extinguishment. Our capital allocation strategy continues to be focused on increasing the value generated from our balance sheet through the addition of more bitcoin, while managing our debt very carefully. Also, at the end of the fourth quarter, we had $46.8 million in cash on our balance sheet, which is sufficient overall liquidity to manage our ongoing operating needs. 2023 was an extremely successful year for us where we generated approximately $5.8 billion of incremental value from both the increase in the price of bitcoin of our existing holdings, as well as through our strategic use of equity capital markets activities. We began the year with 132,500 bitcoins on our balance sheet with a market value of approximately $2.2 billion. As bitcoin prices increased from approximately $16,500 to approximately $42,500 by the end of the year, it resulted in an increase of over $3.4 billion in value based on our bitcoin holdings at the start of the year. In addition to the price appreciation of bitcoin we held as of the beginning of the year, MicroStrategy's issuance additional equity and use of excess cash from operations to purchase even more bitcoin in 2023 led to an increase of an additional $1.9 billion in value of our bitcoin holdings. In total, we add an additional 56,650 bitcoins to our balance sheet at an average price of $33,580, which generated an approximately $500 million of value from the increase in the price of bitcoin after those purchases were made. Again, overall, 2023 was a tremendously successful year, and taking into account our purchases and appreciation of our holdings, we increased the value of our bitcoin holdings by 267% to $8 billion over the course of the year. While the overall market benefited from the increase in Bitcoin prices, well, we believe our intelligent use of leverage and excess cash to acquire more bitcoin, as well as our equity capital market strategy contributed $2.4 billion of incremental value for our balance sheet, demonstrating our track record of generating value for our shareholders. This slide shows an illustrative example of how responsible and intelligent leverage can be used to boost returns when bitcoin prices are increasing. The baseline returns of any long bitcoin strategy benefit from spot bitcoin price appreciation. Bitcoin ETPs also benefit from this offset, of course, by the management fees that are charged for those products. Leverage provides us the opportunity to generate higher returns if price increases. In this illustration, assuming bitcoin price reaches $250,000, keeping bitcoin count constant, Spot Bitcoin without leverage would return approximately 480%. In this example, adding leverage to acquire more bitcoin would return between 660% to 740%, depending on the amount of leverage further boosting returns compared to simply holding spot. If the market value of our bitcoin increases, we believe this would create more opportunities to manage our leverage targets. With the opportunity to take on more leverage in a prudent, risk-managed fashion, the value generated from our increasing bitcoin holdings would be expected to outperform even further if bitcoin prices continue to rise. MicroStrategy's value proposition is clear when compared to other forms of exposure to bitcoin. And as Phong said earlier, we believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for shareholder value creation. The management team has demonstrated a track record of disciplined approach to navigate through volatile times in the bitcoin market and establish credibility in achieving our goal of generating more value for our shareholders. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Andrew. I'm Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. First, I'd like to go over a few performance statistics with you. Since August 10th or August 11th, when we adopted our bitcoin strategy, our stock has outperformed bitcoin, as well as every major asset class along with every major big tech stock, as well as every major enterprise software stock. We're very proud of this. And for those of you who have followed us on this journey, it's been a number of steps every single quarter that got us here. But I think that this is a very useful chart to illustrate and discuss some key elements in our strategy and in our business outlook. First of all, with regard to bitcoin, 2024 is the year of birth of bitcoin as an institutional grade asset class. Bitcoin is being increasingly referred to as an asset class and as a new asset class. And in fact, it's the first new asset class of the modern era. It's difficult to really name another asset class. Gold, when it was converted to ETFs wasn't a new asset. Commodities were never a new asset. 30 years ago, the S&P Index was converted into an ETF, the Spider. That wasn't a new asset then, but it was certainly a revolution in finance. And so, bitcoin represents many things, but one thing it represents is the first institutional-grade digital asset. And so, we've now completed the first 15 years of the bitcoin life cycle. And in that first 15 years, it was largely unregulated retail asset misunderstood. The next 15 years, I would expect will be a regulated institutional high growth period of bitcoin. Very, very different in many ways from the last 15 years. Bitcoin itself is performing well for a number of reasons. But one reason is because it represents the digital transformation of capital. If we look at some of these other great performers on the chart, like Microsoft and Google and Meta and Apple, they're all digital transformation plays. They represent the digital transformation of devices and the digital transformation of relationships and the digital transformation of information and books and libraries and entertainment and education and the digital transformation of corporate processes at, say, Microsoft. Well bitcoin\u2019s very profound idea, it's, what if we actually transformed capital from its analog form, capital in the form of land or buildings, or capital in the form of shares in an actual physical company, or bushels of corn, or diamonds, or bars of gold, or capital in the form of Fiat currency or bonds. And what if we could actually make that into a digital asset that's created in order to address all of the historic perceived shortcomings of analog assets. What if we had all the benefits of gold, but none of the liabilities of gold? What if we had the benefits of the share of stock, but none of the liabilities of a share of stock? What if we had the benefits of a building but not the liabilities of the building? A synthetic digital asset. And so increasingly investors are recognizing this. That's why bitcoin is up 260% since we embarked on our bitcoin strategy. That's why it's outperforming the S&P and the NASDAQ. That's why it's outperforming gold, silver and bonds. Bitcoin isn't a company. And it's profoundly important to understand that it's not a company, it's an asset class. And as such, based on a commodity, it has spawned an entire universe of companies, products, and services built on that asset class. So part of the driver of bitcoin's performance is not just its protocol and superior fundamental characteristics, but another driver is the industry of bitcoin miners that secure the network and bitcoin custodians and a set of bitcoin exchanges. So we see lots of public companies that are bitcoin miners now. We see many, many companies that are entering into bitcoin custody, like Anchorage, like Bitco, like Fidelity, like Coinbase. We see Bitcoin exchanges, like Block, acting as an exchange, like Fidelity, like Coinbase, like Gemini, et cetera. We're going to see more exchanges. We see an explosion in bitcoin wallets, different software applications for mobile phones or devices in order to move bitcoin around. We've got bitcoin devices themselves for signing and securing the network. There's a whole host of companies in the lightning ecosystem and other bitcoin L2s that are scaling the network. And now, of course, this year, we have bitcoin ETPs, Spot ETPs, and even derivatives of those ETPs, companies that are going to trade the volatility of the underlying Spot ETPs are starting to pop-up in application form. And of course, these ETPs aren't just local or aren't just United States based, but they're global. And that's significant, because every single company everywhere in the world is meeting a different set of compliance requirements. A bitcoin ETP in Hong Kong will serve a different need, meet different compliance requirements and meet the needs of different types of investors from a bitcoin ETP in Canada or in France or in the UK or in the United States. And so, all of these various actors are scaling the bitcoin network with increasing enthusiasm. MicroStrategy, as we've noted, is unique as of now as the first bitcoin development company, but hopefully not for long. We've published our playbook and we're showing other companies how to do it. And there's a lot of real estate development companies in the world, companies that issue securities and develop real estate. There are a lot of oil or petroleum exploration and development companies in the world. There are natural gas development companies in the world. There are software development companies in the world. So we believe that as awareness builds a bitcoin as a commodity, as a global commodity, as a unique asset class, I think we're going to see more entrepreneurs enter the space and start to work in these various areas to add value to the ecosystem. It's worthwhile to note, people are, in the early days, they thought of bitcoin as currency and a medium of exchange, and that creates a lot of misunderstandings and a lot of inappropriate or irrelevant criticisms with the advent of these new ETPs from BlackRock and from Fidelity. Awareness of bitcoin -- can you please go back? Yeah, let's stay on the slide. Awareness of bitcoin as a store of value asset is growing and people are starting to see bitcoin not as digital currency, but as digital property or digital gold, a digital store of value. You could think of it as gold or you could think of it as property or think of it as another kind of digital store of value. But in that regard, you kind of have to compare it against other liquid stores of value that people are using. So for right now, the most common alternative to bitcoin for a tech enthusiast would be to invest in big tech, like the Magnificent 7, the Microsoft, the Google, the Meta\u2019s. But as you can see, when the market cap of a big tech company doubles, you have a company doing a lot of work, generating a lot of cash flow to support the market cap. And the work that they have to do doubles. And if they want to double their market cap, their value, again, they have to keep generating -- they have to keep doing more work, generating more cash, because traditional finance technique is, I dividend out my cash flows or I buy the stock back. Two very famous examples of this traditional approach are Apple and Meta, who are both engaging in monstrous capital return programs. So a stock is returning its capital and its value or store of value promise is based upon being able to grow its cash flows faster than the rate of inflation. So they're working increasingly hard. If you want to make it 10 times more valuable, eventually you got to come up with a way to get 10 times more cash flows. And that's very different than the bitcoin, because Bitcoin is the asset. So whereas big tech is asset poor, cash flow rich, bitcoin is asset rich and the strategy with bitcoin becomes asset rich. Now we're moving into a macroeconomic environment where we're going to see increasing monetary inflation to pay off the debt. That's well understood. That was even acknowledged by [Jerome Powell] (ph) in a 60 minutes interview this weekend, where he expressed concern. And so as the monetary supply expands, if your strategy is to generate more cash flows, you're going to have to grow your cash flows faster than the rate of monetary inflation. And that means that a big tech strategy becomes increasingly difficult. And so you could almost say, a big tech company becomes more difficult, gets harder, right, as the value increases, but bitcoin gets more compelling as the value of bitcoin increases because the liquidity increases and the network of holders increases. So we're in the first year of bitcoin being viewed seriously as a possible institutional grade store of value. And I believe that over time, it's going to appeal to technology investors as they understand it as digital capital and the digital transformation of capital. And there's a reason that we believe we can outperform other strategies and why we believe a commodity like bitcoin is a better long-term store of value than just buying a portfolio of stocks, because it isn't a cash derivative. I think that it's worthwhile to point out that the arrival of the ETFs have been a catalytic moment, because if you believe bitcoin is only valuable as a medium of exchange, then it's very easy to say, well, it's slow, it's not good medium exchange, it's not the dollar. There are lots of tax problems and liabilities where there are lots of KYC problems, there are a lot of pricing problems, accounting problems, and you just dismiss it. But of course, if we look at all the wealth in the world, only a small percentage of the wealth is stored in a checking account as a medium of exchange. Most of the wealth is really store of value or its useful capital. And so, as that narrative shifts from digital currency to digital property and from medium of exchange to store of value. Past criticisms are becoming irrelevant. And now if you look at bitcoin as a digital gold, as gold, it can be 10 times what it is, and as property it could be 100 times what it is. And we don't need to address any of the traditional currency criticisms or medium of exchange criticisms. In fact, one could say simply as a store of value, there's no reason why bitcoin can't continue to outperform and can't become 100 times what it is. And these ETPs that have been released are doing a tremendous job of scaling bitcoin as a store of value, because they're putting it within the grasp. You can buy $100 worth of it in millions or 10s of millions or 100 millions of accounts with one-one hundredth of the friction -- perhaps one-one thousandth of the friction that traditional investors faced just a few years ago when they had to go set up a crypto account on a crypto exchange. And then they had to figure out who their bitcoin custodian is going to be or whether they're going to do self-custody. And there are large classes of investors and institutional investors that either can't or won't do that. So we're living through a very exciting period. Now we can go to the next slide. The question is, what's micro strategy going to do in order to support the bitcoin network, in order to benefit our shareholders from these trends? Well, as you can see, and as we've said, we view ourselves as a bitcoin development company. And what does that mean? Well, that means we're going to do everything we can to grow the bitcoin network. We're going to do everything we can to acquire more bitcoin. And we're going to do everything we can to benefit our shareholders and do this in an creative fashion. And when we consider our options and our unique strengths, we boil it down to four. First of all, our company structure. We are unique as an operating company. And that means we have active control over our capital structure. And we can do things operating companies can do that trust companies like, say, Spot Bitcoin ETPs, they can't do. And that's a wide range of things. One of those things is, we can develop software. And of course, we'll continue to develop business intelligence software. There's extraordinary opportunities to blend artificial intelligence with our traditional business intelligence customer base. It's great value. And we will also continue to pursue bitcoin development opportunities. So develop applications that create value from the bitcoin network, either working on the base layer or working with L2 protocols like the Lightning protocol in order to do this. We're very enthusiastic about that. And as we develop this software, we will release it either to the benefit of the bitcoin network or we'll release it to generate more revenue and work to generate more cash flow so that we can buy more bitcoin. Another thing that we can do uniquely as an operating company is, we can generate cash from operations. There are lots and lots of ways to generate cash from operations, too many for me to enumerate right now. As Andrews pointed out, we've reinvested $726 million in cash to date in the bitcoin network. We expect to continue to be able to reinvest cash into bitcoin acquisitions. And when we do this, this is, we believe, very accretive to our shareholders. And the last point that I would want to make is, we're very fortunate to be able to leverage the capital markets. There really are no companies that have, to the extent that we have, been able to leverage the capital markets to acquire bitcoin. We have acquired bitcoin with senior secured debt issuance. We have acquired bitcoin with convertible debt issuance. We've acquired bitcoin with equity issuance. And those are just three ways we've done it in the past. And as we look forward, we're going to consider all possible capital market opportunities. So perhaps preferred equity would be a route for us to acquire bitcoin with leverage that's beneficial to our shareholders. Perhaps other types of equity would be or continued equity like we have with our ATMs, perhaps convertible debt, perhaps structured notes, perhaps secured debt or perhaps unsecured debt. We try to evaluate all options, we keep our options open, and we ask ourselves the question, is this prudent? And then also, is this accretive? Is this going to be good for our shareholders? And of course, with any discussion of leverage, we don't want too much. We want to just pick just the right amount of leverage, the leverage that allows us to benefit our shareholders without creating undue uncertainty. So this is an ongoing opportunistic exercise of ours quarter by quarter. And of course, every single quarter we expect the bitcoin market, the capital markets, the debt markets will evolve. And so, we pride ourselves on being nimble and being able to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves as we did in Q4 with our equity issuance. Sometimes it's appropriate to go fast. Sometimes it's appropriate to go slow. Sometimes it's appropriate to do nothing and wait for better opportunities to present themselves. The nice thing about our situation right now is that, we have all these options and we believe we're structured very, very well to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves in the bitcoin era of institutional adoption that we see over the coming 15 years. It won't be like the first 15 years, but we believe it will be a healthy growth period presenting many, many opportunities for corporations such as ours as more and more institutional investors and retail investors become aware of bitcoin and as regulatory clarity spreads everywhere in the world. And with that, I guess I'd like to pass the floor to Shirish for questions.\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. We're going to jump into the questions. And the first question is for Phong. Phong, if you can elaborate on the company's new positioning as the bitcoin development company? And does this mean any different allocation of R&D? And will you be allocating more R&D into Lightning and Layer 2 applications? If you can elaborate a little more on that.\nPhong Le: Thanks, Shirish, and thanks for the question. I think our press release and our prepared remarks, and Mike actually did a really nice job of explaining our positioning as a bitcoin development company. We thought long and hard about the positioning and the right words to describe our unique value proposition. I suggest everyone take a quick look or a long look at that. On the R&D piece, we will invest more in R&D into bitcoin software development. It will not be at the expense of our business intelligence and AI and cloud-based software development. Some of the things that we've been doing, you've seen at our Bitcoin and Lightning for Corporations MicroStrategy World event last year, where we implemented a Lightning Rewards program on the Layer 2 network. We're also looking at some things that will leverage the native bitcoin blockchain technology, some security applications that we'll reveal at our next MicroStrategy World Conference. So we're excited about bitcoin overall, but very excited about some of the software development capabilities that we'll be able to create coming out of it.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. The next question is for Andrew. You talked about excess cash and leverage, highlighting the value proposition for MicroStrategy. How do you plan to acquire more Bitcoin in 2024?\nAndrew Kang: Thanks for the question. I think Michael summed it up really well in the last few minutes of his remarks. I believe we have all options available to us, which includes excess cash, but also all the different forms of capital that we could issue through debt and equity markets. I think as we've done in the past, those are the levers that we'll use to acquire more bitcoin. I think 2024 will offer some opportunities for us to do so. I think as our market value increases with the increasing price of bitcoin, I think there will be additional opportunities to access the capital markets. And similar to what we've always said, we will look to assess which is the most accretive. We've issued debt in certain markets, we've issued equity in different types of markets. I think we've demonstrated the track record of our ability to think through those complex ideas. And so as Michael alluded to, I think we have all of those options available to us to acquire more bitcoin in 2024.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you. The next question is for Phong, regarding cloud. So can you please elaborate on the progress of converting software clients to cloud from license? And how is the timing of transition looking overall?\nPhong Le: Yes, 2023 is a pretty pivotal year for us. One, our subscription services revenue has now surpassed our product license revenue. And two, our subscription services revenue has surpassed our other services revenue. And so that was a pretty big transition. It's now the second biggest revenue line item behind product support, which represents the maintenance that on-prem customers pay us. Another data point I'll give you is, we are near or exceeding the $100 million of ARR in the cloud, which is a pretty major milestone for any software company and a very major milestone for us as we're transitioning from on-prem to the cloud. That said, we still have less than 25% of our recurring revenue in the cloud. So there's still a pretty major opportunity, and there are greater than 75% of on-prem revenue that we need to move. I think 2024 is going to be an acceleration year in terms of moving existing customers to the cloud and getting more new customers to move the cloud. Reasons for that I talked about, one is our partnerships with our hyperscalers including Microsoft, Azure, Amazon, AWS, and Google, GCP. Another reason is the maturity of our technology offering, container-based, microservices-based, and the fact that we're going to roll out a private cloud offering this year. So a lot of progress, but more opportunity to move to the cloud. And I would say 2024 will be probably the most important year for our transition we've seen in the history of the company in terms of moving to the cloud. And we have the entire organization aligned behind it and we have our customers ready to roll.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you. The next question is also for Phong. How is the initial reception of the AI product, and what do you think this will contribute to product mix or profit margins? I think it's like a lot of AI products that are actually in the market. First, I'll remind everyone, we went GA with our AI plus BI product in September. So essentially four months ago, end of September, four months ago. And we were the first in the BI space to have done so. And we have a lot of customers who are starting to kick the tires, play around with it, getting excited about it. And what we're really doing is trying to understand what are the production use cases that are going to drive further growth in AI plus BI. The exciting side effect, if you will, is because our AI product is build cloud native and therefore only available in the cloud is accelerating our cloud migration even further. So while the revenue impact of AI directly may not be extremely significant in 2024, it could be, but we're not positive yet. What will be significant is how it's driving our customers to migrate to the cloud. And back to the previous question, that'll show up in our revenues and our transition to subscription services revenue and our increase in cloud ARR. And we're seeing that happen already. We're seeing CIOs, CEOs, COOs saying this gives us a real important reason to want to move MicroStrategy in all of our workloads to the cloud.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Tom. The next question is for Andrew, regarding the debt maturity. So how do you plan to address your upcoming 2025 convert maturity? And what are the different ways the company can pursue?\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Shirish. I guess first to note, we still have a good amount of time before that maturity arises in December 2025. We've always managed our maturities from a timing perspective that gives us ample time to figure out these types of questions. But that being said, I think we are getting closer and we're continually evaluating the market opportunities in regards to 2025s. We could of course -- they could equitize at the conversion price, that's clearly one option. I think other options out there exist and potentially being able to refinance those converts, which could allow us to even stand out maturities further. Of course, all that would be based on market conditions. But the point is, I think we're evaluating everything. And I think it's something that we'll keep very close consideration in the coming months.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. I'll ask one last question for Michael here, given that we are coming to the end of the time. How important is the SEC acceptance of Spot Bitcoin ETPs in terms of eventual mainstreaming of Bitcoin as a legitimate form of money?\nMichael Saylor: Yes, I think it's tremendously important. I think the approval of the Spot ETPs marked an inflection point in the history of bitcoin and it demarcates the era of retail offshore unregulated crypto adoption versus the era of onshore regulated institutional bitcoin adoption by the mainstream investors and investment community. We can already see these ETPs have been a screaming success as a launch. They're sucking all the oxygen out of the room, getting all the attention in the ETF industry. They've already marched up the leaderboard amongst the top commodity ETFs in the world very rapidly. It's pretty clear that bitcoin is now on a path to eat gold, to subsume gold's monetary value and of course it's a fairly easy trade for someone now to sell their gold ETF and buy a Bitcoin ETF. It just takes a matter of 30 second phone call. And so the amount of the frequency with which people are comparing bitcoin to gold is dramatically increasing. The frequency of bitcoin in a conversation with a registered financial advisor is going up by orders of magnitude. So this has catalyzed the adoption and the normalization of bitcoin throughout the traditional finance industry. I think the implication is bitcoin will become everybody's favorite commodity investment because the other investments like gold, silver, basic commodities, natural gas, oil, they have not been terribly successful strategies and bitcoin has an order of magnitude more enthusiasm behind it. So first bitcoin takes over commodities, but then bitcoin spreads throughout the entire traditional finance industry in the US. And as it's doing that, it's entering with legitimacy into the political conversation, the banking conversations, the regulatory conversations into mainstream media. It's coming onto college campuses and education institutions, and it's beginning to be talked about much more frequently in technology organizations, startups, and big tech companies. So in general, this is just a massive catalytic event for bitcoin throughout the United States. And that leads to global acceptance and a surge in global interest. We're already seeing a lot more talk about bitcoin outside of the US, and many other countries take their lead from US regulators. So we already have seen discussions of bitcoin Spot ETFs in Hong Kong, but I think you'll see any resistance to a similar product in South America, Africa, Europe, Asia is going to decrease dramatically in the aftermath of the SEC approval. There used to be a little, a structure of bitcoin investors and there were five classes. There were the deniers that thought it was tulip bulbs and it was not legitimate. And then the skeptics, that thought, oh, it's too good to be true. It's going to be banned. And then you've got the traders that they recognize as an asset and they just trade it for the volatility because it's fun to trade. And then you've got the investors that think, well, maybe it's something like the next big tech company like an Apple or a Facebook. So I'll kind of buy it as a store of value in my tech portfolio. And then you've got the maximalist, and the maximalist think it's an instrument of economic empowerment. It's a way to spread global freedom and sovereignty, and it's a way to make the world a better place. And of course, the maximalist we can find on Twitter, but the significance of this SEC approval is that the deniers have been discredited and the skeptics are being silenced. That is to say, if you think it's not a legitimate asset, well, there's no way that the SEC would have approved an ATP on fake counterfeit tulip bulbs or something random and ridiculous. So the deniers don't really have a lot of credibility anymore. And the skeptics, the ones that said, I get it, but it's too good to be true, and it's too threatening to the establishment, so it'll be banned. Well, they typically -- they were the ones that thought of as a medium of exchange and a currency and a competition for the dollar. And now they're beginning to realize that the establishment views this as a store of value, maybe a speculative asset, maybe they're not going to endorse the asset, but it's an asset, it's not a currency substitute. And as such, no, it's not going to be banned. If BlackRock can sell it to you, if Fidelity can sell it to you, it's not being banned. So the deniers are out of the picture. The skeptics are increasingly looking out of touch. And the entire investment community has shifted right toward either being a trader, an investor, or a maximalist. And this is profoundly positive and auspicious for Bitcoin as an asset class. You put these things together and awareness is spreading and support is spreading everywhere in the world. Now you're probably not going to get fired if you're working at a bank or a financial institution. And you say, hey, maybe we should look at this and maybe write a piece about it or do some research on it or consider whether we can trade it or custody it or build a product on it. And that wasn't really something that was easy to consider two, three, four years ago. In fact, we've even shifted the point where now there's a lot of mainstream and even political lobbying to say revoke, staff accounting bulletin 121 that makes it difficult for banks to custody bitcoin. So there's a lot of political pressure to normalize the asset, to embrace the asset, to allow companies to do business with this asset. And so I think that this ETP launch really was the beginning of the next stage of growth of the entire bitcoin network. And it was really the catalytic event necessary for institutions everywhere in the world to begin to invest material amounts of capital or material amounts of time or energy, or to risk their brands and their reputations to do business with and support bitcoin. And so, we're only like three and a half weeks into it. And so it's hard to see all of the positive developments that are being catalyzed by this. But I do believe we will see them manifest themselves over time. And quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year, we're going to see many, many positive developments that bring bitcoin to many, many more investors and many more organizations, many more companies, many more countries, and increasingly bring utility to the world.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. Thank you so much, Michael. We received so many great questions that we couldn't answer, but we would like to thank you everyone for attending and asking the questions. We will try to cover these in our future remarks. But this concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar. I will now turn the call over to Phong for closing remarks.\nPhong Le: I want to thank everyone for being with us today, for your continued support of MicroStrategy. Before we wrap up, I'm pleased to share that our next in-person MicroStrategy World Conference will be held from April 29th to May 2nd in Las Vegas, Nevada. There will be a Business Intelligence track and a Bitcoin for Corporations track, and you can expect that we'll further expand on a lot of the discussion we had today at that MicroStrategy World event, and it's a great way for you to interact with us live and in-person. Registrations are open, and additional details can be found on our event website page, microstrategy.com/world24. We're excited and looking forward to seeing customers, prospects, and shareholders at this one-of-a-kind event. We're as enthusiastic as ever with both our enterprise software strategy, as well as our bitcoin strategy. We wish you a good quarter and look forward to seeing you again, if not at MicroStrategy World, again in 12 weeks. Thank you all.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. I'm Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy. First, I'd like to go over a few performance statistics with you. Since August 10th or August 11th, when we adopted our bitcoin strategy, our stock has outperformed bitcoin, as well as every major asset class along with every major big tech stock, as well as every major enterprise software stock. We're very proud of this. And for those of you who have followed us on this journey, it's been a number of steps every single quarter that got us here. But I think that this is a very useful chart to illustrate and discuss some key elements in our strategy and in our business outlook. First of all, with regard to bitcoin, 2024 is the year of birth of bitcoin as an institutional grade asset class. Bitcoin is being increasingly referred to as an asset class and as a new asset class. And in fact, it's the first new asset class of the modern era. It's difficult to really name another asset class. Gold, when it was converted to ETFs wasn't a new asset. Commodities were never a new asset. 30 years ago, the S&P Index was converted into an ETF, the Spider. That wasn't a new asset then, but it was certainly a revolution in finance. And so, bitcoin represents many things, but one thing it represents is the first institutional-grade digital asset. And so, we've now completed the first 15 years of the bitcoin life cycle. And in that first 15 years, it was largely unregulated retail asset misunderstood. The next 15 years, I would expect will be a regulated institutional high growth period of bitcoin. Very, very different in many ways from the last 15 years. Bitcoin itself is performing well for a number of reasons. But one reason is because it represents the digital transformation of capital. If we look at some of these other great performers on the chart, like Microsoft and Google and Meta and Apple, they're all digital transformation plays. They represent the digital transformation of devices and the digital transformation of relationships and the digital transformation of information and books and libraries and entertainment and education and the digital transformation of corporate processes at, say, Microsoft. Well bitcoin's very profound idea, it's, what if we actually transformed capital from its analog form, capital in the form of land or buildings, or capital in the form of shares in an actual physical company, or bushels of corn, or diamonds, or bars of gold, or capital in the form of Fiat currency or bonds. And what if we could actually make that into a digital asset that's created in order to address all of the historic perceived shortcomings of analog assets. What if we had all the benefits of gold, but none of the liabilities of gold? What if we had the benefits of the share of stock, but none of the liabilities of a share of stock? What if we had the benefits of a building but not the liabilities of the building? A synthetic digital asset. And so increasingly investors are recognizing this. That's why bitcoin is up 260% since we embarked on our bitcoin strategy. That's why it's outperforming the S&P and the NASDAQ. That's why it's outperforming gold, silver and bonds. Bitcoin isn't a company. And it's profoundly important to understand that it's not a company, it's an asset class. And as such, based on a commodity, it has spawned an entire universe of companies, products, and services built on that asset class. So part of the driver of bitcoin's performance is not just its protocol and superior fundamental characteristics, but another driver is the industry of bitcoin miners that secure the network and bitcoin custodians and a set of bitcoin exchanges. So we see lots of public companies that are bitcoin miners now. We see many, many companies that are entering into bitcoin custody, like Anchorage, like Bitco, like Fidelity, like Coinbase. We see Bitcoin exchanges, like Block, acting as an exchange, like Fidelity, like Coinbase, like Gemini, et cetera. We're going to see more exchanges. We see an explosion in bitcoin wallets, different software applications for mobile phones or devices in order to move bitcoin around. We've got bitcoin devices themselves for signing and securing the network. There's a whole host of companies in the lightning ecosystem and other bitcoin L2s that are scaling the network. And now, of course, this year, we have bitcoin ETPs, Spot ETPs, and even derivatives of those ETPs, companies that are going to trade the volatility of the underlying Spot ETPs are starting to pop-up in application form. And of course, these ETPs aren't just local or aren't just United States based, but they're global. And that's significant, because every single company everywhere in the world is meeting a different set of compliance requirements. A bitcoin ETP in Hong Kong will serve a different need, meet different compliance requirements and meet the needs of different types of investors from a bitcoin ETP in Canada or in France or in the UK or in the United States. And so, all of these various actors are scaling the bitcoin network with increasing enthusiasm. MicroStrategy, as we've noted, is unique as of now as the first bitcoin development company, but hopefully not for long. We've published our playbook and we're showing other companies how to do it. And there's a lot of real estate development companies in the world, companies that issue securities and develop real estate. There are a lot of oil or petroleum exploration and development companies in the world. There are natural gas development companies in the world. There are software development companies in the world. So we believe that as awareness builds a bitcoin as a commodity, as a global commodity, as a unique asset class, I think we're going to see more entrepreneurs enter the space and start to work in these various areas to add value to the ecosystem. It's worthwhile to note, people are, in the early days, they thought of bitcoin as currency and a medium of exchange, and that creates a lot of misunderstandings and a lot of inappropriate or irrelevant criticisms with the advent of these new ETPs from BlackRock and from Fidelity. Awareness of bitcoin -- can you please go back? Yeah, let's stay on the slide. Awareness of bitcoin as a store of value asset is growing and people are starting to see bitcoin not as digital currency, but as digital property or digital gold, a digital store of value. You could think of it as gold or you could think of it as property or think of it as another kind of digital store of value. But in that regard, you kind of have to compare it against other liquid stores of value that people are using. So for right now, the most common alternative to bitcoin for a tech enthusiast would be to invest in big tech, like the Magnificent 7, the Microsoft, the Google, the Meta's. But as you can see, when the market cap of a big tech company doubles, you have a company doing a lot of work, generating a lot of cash flow to support the market cap. And the work that they have to do doubles. And if they want to double their market cap, their value, again, they have to keep generating -- they have to keep doing more work, generating more cash, because traditional finance technique is, I dividend out my cash flows or I buy the stock back. Two very famous examples of this traditional approach are Apple and Meta, who are both engaging in monstrous capital return programs. So a stock is returning its capital and its value or store of value promise is based upon being able to grow its cash flows faster than the rate of inflation. So they're working increasingly hard. If you want to make it 10 times more valuable, eventually you got to come up with a way to get 10 times more cash flows. And that's very different than the bitcoin, because Bitcoin is the asset. So whereas big tech is asset poor, cash flow rich, bitcoin is asset rich and the strategy with bitcoin becomes asset rich. Now we're moving into a macroeconomic environment where we're going to see increasing monetary inflation to pay off the debt. That's well understood. That was even acknowledged by [Jerome Powell] (ph) in a 60 minutes interview this weekend, where he expressed concern. And so as the monetary supply expands, if your strategy is to generate more cash flows, you're going to have to grow your cash flows faster than the rate of monetary inflation. And that means that a big tech strategy becomes increasingly difficult. And so you could almost say, a big tech company becomes more difficult, gets harder, right, as the value increases, but bitcoin gets more compelling as the value of bitcoin increases because the liquidity increases and the network of holders increases. So we're in the first year of bitcoin being viewed seriously as a possible institutional grade store of value. And I believe that over time, it's going to appeal to technology investors as they understand it as digital capital and the digital transformation of capital. And there's a reason that we believe we can outperform other strategies and why we believe a commodity like bitcoin is a better long-term store of value than just buying a portfolio of stocks, because it isn't a cash derivative. I think that it's worthwhile to point out that the arrival of the ETFs have been a catalytic moment, because if you believe bitcoin is only valuable as a medium of exchange, then it's very easy to say, well, it's slow, it's not good medium exchange, it's not the dollar. There are lots of tax problems and liabilities where there are lots of KYC problems, there are a lot of pricing problems, accounting problems, and you just dismiss it. But of course, if we look at all the wealth in the world, only a small percentage of the wealth is stored in a checking account as a medium of exchange. Most of the wealth is really store of value or its useful capital. And so, as that narrative shifts from digital currency to digital property and from medium of exchange to store of value. Past criticisms are becoming irrelevant. And now if you look at bitcoin as a digital gold, as gold, it can be 10 times what it is, and as property it could be 100 times what it is. And we don't need to address any of the traditional currency criticisms or medium of exchange criticisms. In fact, one could say simply as a store of value, there's no reason why bitcoin can't continue to outperform and can't become 100 times what it is. And these ETPs that have been released are doing a tremendous job of scaling bitcoin as a store of value, because they're putting it within the grasp. You can buy $100 worth of it in millions or 10s of millions or 100 millions of accounts with one-one hundredth of the friction -- perhaps one-one thousandth of the friction that traditional investors faced just a few years ago when they had to go set up a crypto account on a crypto exchange. And then they had to figure out who their bitcoin custodian is going to be or whether they're going to do self-custody. And there are large classes of investors and institutional investors that either can't or won't do that. So we're living through a very exciting period. Now we can go to the next slide. The question is, what's micro strategy going to do in order to support the bitcoin network, in order to benefit our shareholders from these trends? Well, as you can see, and as we've said, we view ourselves as a bitcoin development company. And what does that mean? Well, that means we're going to do everything we can to grow the bitcoin network. We're going to do everything we can to acquire more bitcoin. And we're going to do everything we can to benefit our shareholders and do this in an creative fashion. And when we consider our options and our unique strengths, we boil it down to four. First of all, our company structure. We are unique as an operating company. And that means we have active control over our capital structure. And we can do things operating companies can do that trust companies like, say, Spot Bitcoin ETPs, they can't do. And that's a wide range of things. One of those things is, we can develop software. And of course, we'll continue to develop business intelligence software. There's extraordinary opportunities to blend artificial intelligence with our traditional business intelligence customer base. It's great value. And we will also continue to pursue bitcoin development opportunities. So develop applications that create value from the bitcoin network, either working on the base layer or working with L2 protocols like the Lightning protocol in order to do this. We're very enthusiastic about that. And as we develop this software, we will release it either to the benefit of the bitcoin network or we'll release it to generate more revenue and work to generate more cash flow so that we can buy more bitcoin. Another thing that we can do uniquely as an operating company is, we can generate cash from operations. There are lots and lots of ways to generate cash from operations, too many for me to enumerate right now. As Andrews pointed out, we've reinvested $726 million in cash to date in the bitcoin network. We expect to continue to be able to reinvest cash into bitcoin acquisitions. And when we do this, this is, we believe, very accretive to our shareholders. And the last point that I would want to make is, we're very fortunate to be able to leverage the capital markets. There really are no companies that have, to the extent that we have, been able to leverage the capital markets to acquire bitcoin. We have acquired bitcoin with senior secured debt issuance. We have acquired bitcoin with convertible debt issuance. We've acquired bitcoin with equity issuance. And those are just three ways we've done it in the past. And as we look forward, we're going to consider all possible capital market opportunities. So perhaps preferred equity would be a route for us to acquire bitcoin with leverage that's beneficial to our shareholders. Perhaps other types of equity would be or continued equity like we have with our ATMs, perhaps convertible debt, perhaps structured notes, perhaps secured debt or perhaps unsecured debt. We try to evaluate all options, we keep our options open, and we ask ourselves the question, is this prudent? And then also, is this accretive? Is this going to be good for our shareholders? And of course, with any discussion of leverage, we don't want too much. We want to just pick just the right amount of leverage, the leverage that allows us to benefit our shareholders without creating undue uncertainty. So this is an ongoing opportunistic exercise of ours quarter by quarter. And of course, every single quarter we expect the bitcoin market, the capital markets, the debt markets will evolve. And so, we pride ourselves on being nimble and being able to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves as we did in Q4 with our equity issuance. Sometimes it's appropriate to go fast. Sometimes it's appropriate to go slow. Sometimes it's appropriate to do nothing and wait for better opportunities to present themselves. The nice thing about our situation right now is that, we have all these options and we believe we're structured very, very well to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves in the bitcoin era of institutional adoption that we see over the coming 15 years. It won't be like the first 15 years, but we believe it will be a healthy growth period presenting many, many opportunities for corporations such as ours as more and more institutional investors and retail investors become aware of bitcoin and as regulatory clarity spreads everywhere in the world. And with that, I guess I'd like to pass the floor to Shirish for questions. Yes, I think it's tremendously important. I think the approval of the Spot ETPs marked an inflection point in the history of bitcoin and it demarcates the era of retail offshore unregulated crypto adoption versus the era of onshore regulated institutional bitcoin adoption by the mainstream investors and investment community. We can already see these ETPs have been a screaming success as a launch. They're sucking all the oxygen out of the room, getting all the attention in the ETF industry. They've already marched up the leaderboard amongst the top commodity ETFs in the world very rapidly. It's pretty clear that bitcoin is now on a path to eat gold, to subsume gold's monetary value and of course it's a fairly easy trade for someone now to sell their gold ETF and buy a Bitcoin ETF. It just takes a matter of 30 second phone call. And so the amount of the frequency with which people are comparing bitcoin to gold is dramatically increasing. The frequency of bitcoin in a conversation with a registered financial advisor is going up by orders of magnitude. So this has catalyzed the adoption and the normalization of bitcoin throughout the traditional finance industry. I think the implication is bitcoin will become everybody's favorite commodity investment because the other investments like gold, silver, basic commodities, natural gas, oil, they have not been terribly successful strategies and bitcoin has an order of magnitude more enthusiasm behind it. So first bitcoin takes over commodities, but then bitcoin spreads throughout the entire traditional finance industry in the US. And as it's doing that, it's entering with legitimacy into the political conversation, the banking conversations, the regulatory conversations into mainstream media. It's coming onto college campuses and education institutions, and it's beginning to be talked about much more frequently in technology organizations, startups, and big tech companies. So in general, this is just a massive catalytic event for bitcoin throughout the United States. And that leads to global acceptance and a surge in global interest. We're already seeing a lot more talk about bitcoin outside of the US, and many other countries take their lead from US regulators. So we already have seen discussions of bitcoin Spot ETFs in Hong Kong, but I think you'll see any resistance to a similar product in South America, Africa, Europe, Asia is going to decrease dramatically in the aftermath of the SEC approval. There used to be a little, a structure of bitcoin investors and there were five classes. There were the deniers that thought it was tulip bulbs and it was not legitimate. And then the skeptics, that thought, oh, it's too good to be true. It's going to be banned. And then you've got the traders that they recognize as an asset and they just trade it for the volatility because it's fun to trade. And then you've got the investors that think, well, maybe it's something like the next big tech company like an Apple or a Facebook. So I'll kind of buy it as a store of value in my tech portfolio. And then you've got the maximalist, and the maximalist think it's an instrument of economic empowerment. It's a way to spread global freedom and sovereignty, and it's a way to make the world a better place. And of course, the maximalist we can find on Twitter, but the significance of this SEC approval is that the deniers have been discredited and the skeptics are being silenced. That is to say, if you think it's not a legitimate asset, well, there's no way that the SEC would have approved an ATP on fake counterfeit tulip bulbs or something random and ridiculous. So the deniers don't really have a lot of credibility anymore. And the skeptics, the ones that said, I get it, but it's too good to be true, and it's too threatening to the establishment, so it'll be banned. Well, they typically -- they were the ones that thought of as a medium of exchange and a currency and a competition for the dollar. And now they're beginning to realize that the establishment views this as a store of value, maybe a speculative asset, maybe they're not going to endorse the asset, but it's an asset, it's not a currency substitute. And as such, no, it's not going to be banned. If BlackRock can sell it to you, if Fidelity can sell it to you, it's not being banned. So the deniers are out of the picture. The skeptics are increasingly looking out of touch. And the entire investment community has shifted right toward either being a trader, an investor, or a maximalist. And this is profoundly positive and auspicious for Bitcoin as an asset class. You put these things together and awareness is spreading and support is spreading everywhere in the world. Now you're probably not going to get fired if you're working at a bank or a financial institution. And you say, hey, maybe we should look at this and maybe write a piece about it or do some research on it or consider whether we can trade it or custody it or build a product on it. And that wasn't really something that was easy to consider two, three, four years ago. In fact, we've even shifted the point where now there's a lot of mainstream and even political lobbying to say revoke, staff accounting bulletin 121 that makes it difficult for banks to custody bitcoin. So there's a lot of political pressure to normalize the asset, to embrace the asset, to allow companies to do business with this asset. And so I think that this ETP launch really was the beginning of the next stage of growth of the entire bitcoin network. And it was really the catalytic event necessary for institutions everywhere in the world to begin to invest material amounts of capital or material amounts of time or energy, or to risk their brands and their reputations to do business with and support bitcoin. And so, we're only like three and a half weeks into it. And so it's hard to see all of the positive developments that are being catalyzed by this. But I do believe we will see them manifest themselves over time. And quarter-by-quarter and year-by-year, we're going to see many, many positive developments that bring bitcoin to many, many more investors and many more organizations, many more companies, many more countries, and increasingly bring utility to the world."

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you, Phong. And thank you all for joining. I'll first start with our software financial results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $124.5 million, down 6% year-over-year. For the full year, total revenues were $496.3 million, down slightly 1% year-over-year. Our fourth quarter operating results were mixed with a decline in year-over-year revenues, in part due to the ongoing revenue shift to cloud and the lingering macroeconomic headwinds impacting overall customer spend. Product license revenues were $18.4 million, which was down 33% year-over-year in Q4, and $75.4 million, down about 13% year-over-year for the full year. However, as we transition our business to the cloud, we fully anticipate lower product license revenues as we migrate both existing and new customers to the cloud. More importantly, we continue to grow subscription services revenues which reflect the recurring revenues from our expanding cloud business. In Q4, subscription services revenues were $21.5 million, which is an increase of 23% year-over-year, and $81.2 million for the full year, an increase of 34% year-over-year. Current subscription billings, which reflect new cloud bookings, grew 33% in the fourth quarter to $41.3 million and $94.8 million for the full year, a 23% increase year-over-year, which was our 15th straight quarter of double digit growth in cloud bookings. Q4 was an important milestone for us, where for the first time in both Q4 and for the full year, our subscription services revenues were higher than our product license revenues. This was a significant achievement to show the continued progress in our transition to stronger recurring revenues in the cloud. As I mentioned before, we expect the mix of revenue will continue to shift from product license to subscription services revenues in 2024 as we focus on delivering AI-based products to our customers in the cloud. Moving to costs, total non-GAAP expenses were $148 million in the fourth quarter, 52% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Bitcoin impairment charges for the quarter were $39 million compared to $198 million in Q4 of last year. Total non-GAAP expenses excluding bitcoin impairment were $108 million in the fourth quarter down 3% year-over-year. While we're spending more on cloud hosting costs as we grow our cloud business, we have been able to offset those increases with cost reductions in corporate overhead and while optimizing headcount, which was down 10% year-over-year. We reported a total non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter of $23 million, of which, the loss on the bitcoin impairment was $39 million in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP net income of $89 million, which included a $150 million tax benefit, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset, directly related to our bitcoin holdings. And at the end of Q4, fair market value of bitcoin as of December 31st was above our aggregate cost basis, resulting in a release of the previously established valuation allowance and a corresponding non-cash tax provision benefit. Turning to our bitcoin strategy, we had an extremely successful Q4 adding more bitcoin to our holdings, acquiring 30,905 bitcoins in the quarter, the largest single quarter bitcoin holdings increase since Q4 of 2020. After the end of the quarter, we purchased an additional 850 bitcoins using $37 million of excess cash. And as of February 5th, 2024, the company held a total of 190,000 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate cost of $5.93 billion, or $31,224 per bitcoin. Bitcoins purchased through excess cash from the software business are held at MicroStrategy, the parent entity, and are secured under our 2028 secured notes. As of yesterday, there were 16,931 bitcoins held at MicroStrategy. Bitcoins acquired through proceeds from capital markets activities after the issuance of our senior secured notes, which include equity and debt issuances, are held at MacroStrategy, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy. We hold 173,069 bitcoins, representing 91% of our total bitcoin holdings or over $7.3 billion in current market value at the MacroStrategy level, all of which are currently unrestricted and unencumbered, providing us with optionality to potentially leverage this strategic asset in the future. In Q4, we purchased a total of 30,555 bitcoins for $1.2 billion using net proceeds from our ATM program. As noted a moment ago, these bitcoins are held at MacroStrategy and remain unencumbered. In Q4, we also purchased an additional 350 bitcoins for $13.4 million using excess cash from operations, which are held at MicroStrategy. And subsequently, in January 2024, we used additional excess cash from operations to purchase an additional 850 bitcoins for $37 million, which are also held at MicroStrategy. Our commitment to our bitcoin strategy remains unchanged and unwavering, and we plan to add more bitcoin over time using our excess cash from operations, as well as proceeds from any capital markets activities. MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world and we have remained committed to our bitcoin acquisition strategy with the highest conviction, with a consistent track record, long-term focus, and a strong risk managed approach to acquiring and holding more bitcoin on our balance sheet. Turning to Slide 15, we saw bitcoin outperform the US equity markets in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of our bitcoin holdings is approximately $3.6 billion compared to approximately $8 billion in market value based on the bitcoin price as of the last day of the quarter. Year to date, the market value of our bitcoin holdings is approximately $8.1 billion, which is significantly above our average purchase price of approximately $31,200. In late December, FASB approved a change in accounting rules for certain digital assets, including bitcoin, to be measured using fair value accounting. We are delighted by FASB's expeditious move to create more transparent reporting, and we are encouraged by the continuing maturity of the regulatory environment surrounding bitcoin and we hope these enhanced accounting rules will serve as a positive on-ramp for other corporates to adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve. The new accounting rule requires companies holding digital assets, including bitcoin, to adopt fair value accounting treatment by Q1 of 2025. And while we have not yet elected to early adopt the new accounting standard, which was only just finalized late in the fourth quarter, we continue to evaluate the timing along with accounting and tax impacts of adoption. If we elect to adopt the new accounting standard in 2024, we estimate that our 2024 beginning bitcoin holdings value would be marked up to a fair value of approximately $8 billion as of January 1st, 2024. As Phong mentioned earlier, we have effectively used excess cash flows to grow our bitcoin holdings. At the inception of our bitcoin balance sheet strategy in 2020, we allocated a substantial portion of our cash reserves generated over many previous years into bitcoin, acquiring over 43,000 Bitcoin for $595 million. Beyond that initial acquisition, we have continued to acquire an average of $40 million of bitcoin each year with excess cash on our balance sheet, totaling approximately 3,500 bitcoins since 2022. Our ability to leverage cash from operations enables us to increase our bitcoin holdings in a manner that we believe is accretive to our shareholders. And in total, we have issued approximately $726 million of excess cash to acquire more bitcoin, accounting for approximately 48,000 bitcoin added to our balance sheet, or about 25% of our total bitcoin holdings. Now turning to our capital markets activities, also since the inception of our bitcoin strategy, we have raised $2.2 billion of debt through senior secured notes and convertible notes with an attractive blended interest rate of approximately 1.6%, with the earliest maturity not until 2025. Leverage remains a key component of our active capital management strategy, which when intelligently deployed enables us to accrete more bitcoin on our balance sheet at an attractive cost. We will continue to actively monitor the capital markets, evaluating liability management opportunities to manage our debt maturities as well as opportunities to raise additional debt in the future. In addition to raising debt, we have demonstrated a solid track record of issuing permanent equity capital in a manner that we believe has been accretive to our shareholders. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have raised a total of $3.1 billion in proceeds through our at-the-market or ATM programs, with the average price of approximately $457 per share across total equity raised. In Q4 of last year, we accelerated the execution of our current ATM program and raised $1.2 billion in aggregate net proceeds. And in Q4 alone, we issued approximately 2.27 million shares of Class A common stock [indiscernible] approximately $138 million of capacity remaining under our current program. As we have done in the past, we will continue to carefully evaluate the most accretive use of proceeds from the sale of equity to be incremental value for our shareholders. The primary use of proceeds from the sale of equity to date has been to acquire additional bitcoin. But we also use proceeds of our ATM program to prepay the $250 million bitcoin back loan in Q1 of 2023, which generated a $45 million gain on extinguishment. Our capital allocation strategy continues to be focused on increasing the value generated from our balance sheet through the addition of more bitcoin, while managing our debt very carefully. Also, at the end of the fourth quarter, we had $46.8 million in cash on our balance sheet, which is sufficient overall liquidity to manage our ongoing operating needs. 2023 was an extremely successful year for us where we generated approximately $5.8 billion of incremental value from both the increase in the price of bitcoin of our existing holdings, as well as through our strategic use of equity capital markets activities. We began the year with 132,500 bitcoins on our balance sheet with a market value of approximately $2.2 billion. As bitcoin prices increased from approximately $16,500 to approximately $42,500 by the end of the year, it resulted in an increase of over $3.4 billion in value based on our bitcoin holdings at the start of the year. In addition to the price appreciation of bitcoin we held as of the beginning of the year, MicroStrategy's issuance additional equity and use of excess cash from operations to purchase even more bitcoin in 2023 led to an increase of an additional $1.9 billion in value of our bitcoin holdings. In total, we add an additional 56,650 bitcoins to our balance sheet at an average price of $33,580, which generated an approximately $500 million of value from the increase in the price of bitcoin after those purchases were made. Again, overall, 2023 was a tremendously successful year, and taking into account our purchases and appreciation of our holdings, we increased the value of our bitcoin holdings by 267% to $8 billion over the course of the year. While the overall market benefited from the increase in Bitcoin prices, well, we believe our intelligent use of leverage and excess cash to acquire more bitcoin, as well as our equity capital market strategy contributed $2.4 billion of incremental value for our balance sheet, demonstrating our track record of generating value for our shareholders. This slide shows an illustrative example of how responsible and intelligent leverage can be used to boost returns when bitcoin prices are increasing. The baseline returns of any long bitcoin strategy benefit from spot bitcoin price appreciation. Bitcoin ETPs also benefit from this offset, of course, by the management fees that are charged for those products. Leverage provides us the opportunity to generate higher returns if price increases. In this illustration, assuming bitcoin price reaches $250,000, keeping bitcoin count constant, Spot Bitcoin without leverage would return approximately 480%. In this example, adding leverage to acquire more bitcoin would return between 660% to 740%, depending on the amount of leverage further boosting returns compared to simply holding spot. If the market value of our bitcoin increases, we believe this would create more opportunities to manage our leverage targets. With the opportunity to take on more leverage in a prudent, risk-managed fashion, the value generated from our increasing bitcoin holdings would be expected to outperform even further if bitcoin prices continue to rise. MicroStrategy's value proposition is clear when compared to other forms of exposure to bitcoin. And as Phong said earlier, we believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for shareholder value creation. The management team has demonstrated a track record of disciplined approach to navigate through volatile times in the bitcoin market and establish credibility in achieving our goal of generating more value for our shareholders. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Thanks for the question. I think Michael summed it up really well in the last few minutes of his remarks. I believe we have all options available to us, which includes excess cash, but also all the different forms of capital that we could issue through debt and equity markets. I think as we've done in the past, those are the levers that we'll use to acquire more bitcoin. I think 2024 will offer some opportunities for us to do so. I think as our market value increases with the increasing price of bitcoin, I think there will be additional opportunities to access the capital markets. And similar to what we've always said, we will look to assess which is the most accretive. We've issued debt in certain markets, we've issued equity in different types of markets. I think we've demonstrated the track record of our ability to think through those complex ideas. And so as Michael alluded to, I think we have all of those options available to us to acquire more bitcoin in 2024. Thanks, Shirish. I guess first to note, we still have a good amount of time before that maturity arises in December 2025. We've always managed our maturities from a timing perspective that gives us ample time to figure out these types of questions. But that being said, I think we are getting closer and we're continually evaluating the market opportunities in regards to 2025s. We could of course -- they could equitize at the conversion price, that's clearly one option. I think other options out there exist and potentially being able to refinance those converts, which could allow us to even stand out maturities further. Of course, all that would be based on market conditions. But the point is, I think we're evaluating everything. And I think it's something that we'll keep very close consideration in the coming months."

            "name": "Phong Le",
            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar. I want to start by providing an update on the state of the company and achievements over the past year. Today, MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world, holding 190,000 bitcoins with a total bitcoin market value of $8.1 billion as of yesterday. In 2023, we acquired 56,650 bitcoins for a total purchase cost of $1.9 billion, an average price of $33,580. In 2024 so far, we've acquired an additional 850 bitcoins for a total purchase cost of $37 million. Over the past year, we've seen bitcoin mature further as an institutional-grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption. We remain highly committed to our Bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus. Andrew will provide further details on our Bitcoin purchase activity for this quarter later. MicroStrategy is also positioned as the world's largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company. Our objective is to grow in AI and cloud-powered BI software. We have over 1,900 employees focused on our software business, devoted to achieving our vision of intelligence everywhere. The past year has marked the most transformative in our 25-year history of being a public company as we released MicroStrategy ONE, MicroStrategy AI, MicroStrategy Cloud for Azure, AWS, and now the Google Cloud platform and continue to focus on growth in both cloud and AI plus BI. In 2023, we made important progress in our shift towards our cloud offering resulting in annual subscription services revenue of $81.2 million, an increase of 34% year-over-year. The strong growth in our subscription services revenue was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer renewal rates continue to be among the highest we've ever experienced, and our subscription billings remain strong. Overall, we continue to see further global adoption of our cloud platform as a result of transitioning our business strategy and product offerings from an on-prem perpetual license software company to a cloud native organization. Further, we've transformed the way we function as an organization. We've reorganized and invested in our go-to-market approach to help develop sales opportunities, convert more customers to our cloud offering. We've created a customer success function to focus on the customer experience, including onboarding, adoption, retention, migration, and upsell. This enables our sales teams to focus on selling to new customers in the cloud. We've revised our sales compensation plans to prioritize new business and cloud transactions. We've rebuilt our marketing leadership team and have invested in product marketing, field enablement, brand development, and demand generation. We have expanded our partner sales channel with strategic partnerships with Microsoft, AWS, Google, and Snowflake, harnessing thousands of eager sellers ready to deploy MicroStrategy on their platforms. I believe MicroStrategy is entering 2024 stronger than ever and will continue to provide a unique value proposition for our shareholders. With our bitcoin strategy being so significant to our overall business value, while we also continue to pursue growth in our enterprise analytics business, some may ask, what kind of a company is MicroStrategy now? It's a fair question and a question that takes on even more significance with the approval of Spot Bitcoin ETPs in the United States. We consider MicroStrategy to be unique. We consider MicroStrategy to be the world's first bitcoin development company. Let me explain what we mean. We are a publicly traded operating company committed to the continued development of the bitcoin network through activities in the financial markets, advocacy, and technology innovation. As an operating business, we're able to use cash flows as well as proceeds from equity and debt financing to accumulate bitcoin, which serve as our primary treasury reserve asset. We also develop and provide industry leading AI powered enterprise analytics software that promotes our vision of intelligence everywhere and are also using our software development capabilities to develop bitcoin applications. We believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for value creation. Being an operating company, our software business remains our core revenue and cash flow generator. In addition, it also enables us to acquire bitcoin through the use of excess cash or proceeds from equity capital raises or corporate debt capital raises and to pursue software innovations that leverage the bitcoin blockchain. We've deployed these levers to increase our bitcoin holdings in a manner which we believe has created shareholder value. Bitcoin development includes our bitcoin acquisition strategy and bitcoin advocacy initiatives. Our software development includes BI, AI, Cloud, or Bitcoin and Lightning related software development. Let me elaborate on our 2024 software strategic focus. In 2024, we will continue our transformation focus to wane and grow in AI plus BI, while accelerating our transition to a cloud-centric operating model. Our key strategic goals are to grow cloud, innovate with AI, and increase profitability. So first, let me cover growing with cloud. MicroStrategy Cloud is a key area of our research and development efforts as we expand our platform's flexibility, scalability, and security. In December, we successfully deployed our Google Cloud platform integration, furthering our multi-cloud capabilities, providing greater optionality to our customers. This offering is microservices and container-based and uses our most recent cloud innovations. As of today, MicroStrategy can be deployed and fully hosted on Azure, AWS, and GCP. Additionally, we'll provide the ability to automate deployment of MicroStrategy with many of the same benefits of a public cloud, but in a private cloud later this year. This distinguishes us from other BI platforms with the flexibility and automation that enterprise customers require. We believe such investment and capability will encourage current on-premise customers to embrace the benefits of MicroStrategy Cloud, such as containerized architecture, proactive cloud management from experts, seamless backups, and single click updates. Transitioning our customer base to the technology of the future remains a key focus, and our resource deployment underscores our commitment to the cloud first approach. As customers and prospects move to the cloud to empower their AI-driven digital transformations, we expect a decrease in product license revenues. This will in part be offset by increases in subscription services revenues in the same year and will be more than offset with higher recurring revenues in the following years. This will be most pronounced in 2024 as we expect to increase the pace of cloud adoption. Besides more healthy recurring revenues, additional benefits of moving customers and prospects to cloud include more engaged and happy customers using our latest software, resulting in higher retention rates. The second area of focus for our software business is to innovate with AI. We will continue to focus on product innovation and AI-powered BI in the cloud. In September, MicroStrategy released its most innovative product to date, MicroStrategy AI. Our innovative, first-to-market AI solution offers capabilities designed to deliver an exceptional user experience on trusted data, featuring out of the box resources that streamline adoption on our multi-cloud platform. The initial reception from customers has been positive. Our platform's AI/BI capabilities enable customers to automate their BI workflows, including building data wrangling, dashboard creation, and data exploration. This elevates the role of data throughout the organization, allowing companies to make better database decisions and take actions. We believe that our continued thought leadership and innovation focus in the AI plus BI intersection will serve as a growth catalyst for MicroStrategy into the future. As business continues to search for efficiencies to reduce cost, increase productivity, and increase revenues, AI solutions and trusted data will continue to gain prevalence as a necessity. In addition, in December, we released our standalone bot feature as an extension of our MicroStrategy AI capabilities. With the release of build your own bot, MicroStrategy has entered the adjacent bot market with the capabilities and pedigree of our BI product to address a wide range of use cases. When considering the services currently offered in the bot market, we noticed customer demand for a bot builder that addresses [GenAI] (ph) resource constraints, improves structured data processing, and solving for the lack of enterprise trust provided by current LLM solutions. The current landscape of bot offerings, such as domain-specific bots, LLM, customizations, and flexible build bots either lack the flexibility to address broad use cases or face limitations with structured data. MicroStrategy bots are one of the easiest to use products we've ever developed. Combining our structured data horsepower with our open AI integrated LLM capabilities, we've created an AI bot flexible enough to support any industry vertical or departmental scenario with trusted analytics. Leveraging the MicroStrategy platform's advanced capabilities in the enterprise such as security, governance, integration with third-party tools, and system auditability, we enable customers to easily deploy chatbots for broad use on trusted data. The third area of focus for our software business is to increase profitability. We will continue to optimize our internal organizational structure in 2024. This means being mindful of financial objectives when choosing investment areas, collapse in organizational layers to improve internal velocity, reducing our dependence on low margin consulting in favor of external partners, and leverage our leadership team to guide both strategy and execution to deliver increased profitability. For 2024, operating goals for our software business are to increase overall top-line revenue compared to 2023 and target non-GAAP operating income, excluding impairment losses of $70 million to $90 million. Increased profitability would further enable us to increase our bitcoin holdings. As a bitcoin development company, we're focused on generating value for our stockholders by using various capital markets and technology levers. As an operating company, we can make use of intelligent leverage. Since our adoption of our bitcoin strategy, we've used three primary mechanisms to acquire more bitcoin. One, cash flow from software operations. Since August 2020, we've invested $726 million of total cash on our balance sheet in bitcoin. Two, equity issuances. We have issued $3.1 billion in equity in a manner that we believe to be accretive to existing shareholders to acquire bitcoin. And three, debt financing. We've obtained $2.2 billion in corporate debt proceeds through the issuance of both senior secured notes and convertible notes that we use to purchase bitcoin. The blended cost of our debt is fixed at 1.6% annually. We believe each of these techniques and our unique positioning as the world's first bitcoin development company have enabled us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail. Thanks, Shirish, and thanks for the question. I think our press release and our prepared remarks, and Mike actually did a really nice job of explaining our positioning as a bitcoin development company. We thought long and hard about the positioning and the right words to describe our unique value proposition. I suggest everyone take a quick look or a long look at that. On the R&D piece, we will invest more in R&D into bitcoin software development. It will not be at the expense of our business intelligence and AI and cloud-based software development. Some of the things that we've been doing, you've seen at our Bitcoin and Lightning for Corporations MicroStrategy World event last year, where we implemented a Lightning Rewards program on the Layer 2 network. We're also looking at some things that will leverage the native bitcoin blockchain technology, some security applications that we'll reveal at our next MicroStrategy World Conference. So we're excited about bitcoin overall, but very excited about some of the software development capabilities that we'll be able to create coming out of it. Yes, 2023 is a pretty pivotal year for us. One, our subscription services revenue has now surpassed our product license revenue. And two, our subscription services revenue has surpassed our other services revenue. And so that was a pretty big transition. It's now the second biggest revenue line item behind product support, which represents the maintenance that on-prem customers pay us. Another data point I'll give you is, we are near or exceeding the $100 million of ARR in the cloud, which is a pretty major milestone for any software company and a very major milestone for us as we're transitioning from on-prem to the cloud. That said, we still have less than 25% of our recurring revenue in the cloud. So there's still a pretty major opportunity, and there are greater than 75% of on-prem revenue that we need to move. I think 2024 is going to be an acceleration year in terms of moving existing customers to the cloud and getting more new customers to move the cloud. Reasons for that I talked about, one is our partnerships with our hyperscalers including Microsoft, Azure, Amazon, AWS, and Google, GCP. Another reason is the maturity of our technology offering, container-based, microservices-based, and the fact that we're going to roll out a private cloud offering this year. So a lot of progress, but more opportunity to move to the cloud. And I would say 2024 will be probably the most important year for our transition we've seen in the history of the company in terms of moving to the cloud. And we have the entire organization aligned behind it and we have our customers ready to roll. I want to thank everyone for being with us today, for your continued support of MicroStrategy. Before we wrap up, I'm pleased to share that our next in-person MicroStrategy World Conference will be held from April 29th to May 2nd in Las Vegas, Nevada. There will be a Business Intelligence track and a Bitcoin for Corporations track, and you can expect that we'll further expand on a lot of the discussion we had today at that MicroStrategy World event, and it's a great way for you to interact with us live and in-person. Registrations are open, and additional details can be found on our event website page, microstrategy.com/world24. We're excited and looking forward to seeing customers, prospects, and shareholders at this one-of-a-kind event. We're as enthusiastic as ever with both our enterprise software strategy, as well as our bitcoin strategy. We wish you a good quarter and look forward to seeing you again, if not at MicroStrategy World, again in 12 weeks. Thank you all."

Then, Michael Saylor will provide a strategic review and discuss the recent bitcoin market updates. And lastly, we will open up to Q&A. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phong Le, President and CEO of MicroStrategy. Phong?\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's earnings webinar. I'll start with the highlights of our software business. Total revenue was $129.5 million, representing an increase of 3% year-over-year, total software licenses revenues which consists of total product licenses and subscription services revenues. And our consolidated statement of operations were $45 million, representing an increase of 16% year-over-year. Total software licenses revenues performance benefited for both increased adoption of our cloud platform and growth in product license revenues. Total subscription services revenue was $21 million and increase at 28% year-over-year. Our Q3 subscription billings growth was 17% year-over-year. We achieve good revenue results in Q3 with year-over-year growth driven by our cloud business and a strong international license revenue quarter. We plan to continue to drive growth in our recurring revenue model, and to transition our business strategy and product offerings to a cloud native model. Our focus will be on innovation at the intersection of artificial intelligence and business intelligence, using our first to market advantage in the enterprise scale integration of AI and BI to grow revenue in the cloud. I'm excited about the work we're doing in these areas and to share some updates with you and our progress. We're at a major period of innovation in the technology industry. We believe the next innovation is to change how the world does business or digital money, with the continuing development of the Bitcoin ecosystem in digital intelligence through AI. The technological leaps that occurred in the past year in generative AI are real, and we expect to be at the forefront of integrating AI with BI. MicroStrategy is well positioned to gain competitive leverage in winning both of these areas of growth. MicroStrategy's mission for the past 30 plus years has been to enable intelligence everywhere for our customers. And with this mission ingrained in our corporate D&A through each major tech innovation, we have moved closer to accomplishing this goal. Whether this was OLAP technologies on relational databases, implementing client-based desktop BI tools, introducing the semantic layer, rolling out web BI, or making the shift to mobile and then cloud, each step has successfully enabled to making BI a more ubiquitous component of business decision making. We believe generative AI is the next big innovation that will bring us closer to intelligence everywhere. Before diving into the integration of Gen AI and our platform, it's important to distinguish why MicroStrategy is poised to drive value in the AI space beyond the generic applications and hype built up in the broader market. Hyperscalers and mega software companies are investing billions amassing GPUs in legions of data scientists, to build the best large language models or LLM in the world. Much like we have done with cloud hyperscalers, we plan to openly partner with and leverage the technology investments in these companies. Rather than invest heavily to build our own models. Hundreds of smaller AI companies are taking a similar approach to us. But we're already differentiating as we have done for decades in BI across four major areas. Our 30 years of - number one, our 30 years of enterprise software services and sales capabilities. Number two, our trusted, secure scalable reusable data layer, what we call our semantic layer. Number three, the ability to quickly build and deploy actual applications utilizing this data through technologies like mobile, embedding and microservices. And number four, an open multi-cloud architecture, which in this case, we will use to easily integrate multiple different LLS. We believe this uniquely positions us to win at the intersection of artificial intelligence, and business intelligence. In addition, we believe the combination of AI and BI to be critical for enterprises looking to integrate AI into their day-to-day decision making. Let me explain. BI is precise, use trusted calculations from secured sources of structured data to make informed decisions. But on the other hand, BI can be rigid and difficult to engage with all levels to personas and business users. AI is smart, leveraging natural language generation reasoning and unstructured data to answer freeform questions and ideas. However, results can be untrustworthy in producing determinate answers that, are reliable and consistent enough to make informed business decisions. This is where MicroStrategy one delivers value bridging and precise BI and smart AI. Right now many enterprise AI solutions are focused on efficiency and cost gains. Building applications to help marketers write better, corporate teams process more efficiently and engineers code faster. There's even more value to be unlocked when AI helps analysts make better business decisions to drive top line growth and achieve true strategic advantage. This can be done with generative AI on top of enterprise data. But in doing so combining AI and BI and the challenges with scale, governance and trust with AI are amplified and security and access control are paramount. We expect to see increased customer demand as our platform tackles the primary hurdles customers face with AI adoption. The main customer concerns of enterprise AI or one, data access and security. Two, integration of large language models, natural language processing, and prompt engineering solutions. And three, the ability of distributed AI solutions of scale. Typical AI and BI combinations did that - do not have a semantic layer have unreliable intelligence. The BI tool acts as a simple repository that provides data to the generative AI engine. There's no intelligence in the LLM results, producing false or inaccurate responses commonly referred to as hallucination. MicroStrategy ONE and MicroStrategy AI leveraged the semantic layer to define all data objects within a customer configuration. Our BI architecture provides a framework and structure to the AI solution. The AI and MicroStrategy engineers collaborate to generate higher - quality queries by enhancing and tagging user prompts to pull more tailored results from customer data. MicroStrategy AI is designed to generate answers that are secure, accurate, scalable, and reliable. In September, we introduced our first set of MicroStrategy AI features to the market, which leverages our advanced BI system, fully embedding Microsoft Azure open AI. This release marks one of the most exciting product innovations in the history of the company. These new AI features are cloud native, and only available through MicroStrategy One. We've implemented four features to address, the needs of different business users. One, Auto SQL streamlines the database interaction process. This feature is intended to enhance the technical user experience on MicroStrategy. Our AI application can translate natural language into SQL queries, explain the SQL statements and natural language and review SQL code with suggested optimizations. Two, Auto Dashboard provides automatic dashboard creation, transforming complex data into interactive and beautiful visual insights. MicroStrategy AI processes, the data and can produce it beautiful and viable dashboard. Auto Expert is the automated support tool. It's like having a MicroStrategy employee guide you through the BI platform to answer user base questions such as how do I build an advanced metric? Auto Expert is available for free to all registered users on our website. And Auto Answer is my personal favorite transform self-service analytics, the user engages in natural language conversation, asking the AI system questions related to their data. For example, what is the forecast of revenue for Q1, 2025? What are the drivers of revenue growth? MicroStrategy AI processes the request, we contextualize data to provide rapidly - to rapidly provide answers with a deep level of understanding fastly increasing the data exploration capabilities of a basic user. MicroStrategy AI is the first to market with a fully integrated AI/BI platform and delivers BI features that enable enterprise grade AI deployment. With short as the customers' time to value and enhances the ability to optimize and automate. Furthermore, cloud native solution, drives net new business to the cloud while incentivizing current customers to migrate and expand their footprint. And its offering is also our first entry into consumption-based pricing. Customers will consume the AI product question-by-question. Our initial starter package is $20,000 to 20,000 questions or simply $1 a question. We expect this pricing mechanism to drive adoption and grow the subscription revenue stream while providing a relatively low cost of entry for customers to onboard next generation AI applications. We're already seeing this product driving existing on-premise customers to move to the cloud, or set up a new environment in the cloud to adopt MicroStrategy AI. Our vision for intelligence everywhere continues to inform our roadmap. We believe that AI/BI best empowers customers when it is modular and can be embedded into existing workflows. We also believe that the data that feeds AI/BI the platforms in which it runs and the LLM and machine learning models used - must be flexible and open to fit our customers' needs. Therefore, our roadmap includes the ability to build analytic bots on the platform, as the customers' choice, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private cloud and leverage a variety of LLM are the customers' choice. To build your own bot tool and the MicroStrategy platform harnesses advanced capabilities in enterprise security, such as governance, integration with third-party tools and system auditability, to allow customers to easily deploy chatbots for broad use untrusted data. This feature is standalone and customizable for deployment by any user and the use cases are myriad. For example, internal users can deploy and FP&A chatbot to answer questions related to budget, or users can develop a product Q&A chatbot for customers on their website. We currently expect to build your own bot capability to be available in December of this year. We're excited about our initial AI offerings to the market and for the future as we continue to tap into the potential of AI/BI solutions in our product roadmap. Now, moving to developments on our cloud offer. We continue to build modern, scalable, resilient and cloud native applications that can transition customers from monolithic BI configurations to a microservices architecture that embraces flexibility, agility, and technological diversity. Microservices architecture and containerized structure enables applications to be deployed and scaled independently. These design features are necessary to meet the technological demands of AI, and to maintain the highest level of platform functionality. MicroStrategy Cloud architecture is designed in the cloud for multi-cloud. In Q4, we plan to deploy our Google Cloud implementation, increase your functionality to all three primary hyperscalers and further driving integration of AI and BI to every part of a customer's business. This is a fully containerized microservices based solution, which is the base modern cloud architecture for our MicroStrategy platform. MicroStrategy is now also available on both Azure and AWS marketplaces, firming up our partnership with these hyperscalers. We're also innovating the way we sell our product via partner sales channels with strategic focus aimed to unlock growth, enhance customer success and deepened market penetration in a rapidly evolving AI and BI market. We've announced recent partnerships with Microsoft Azure, including with open AI, AWS, and Snowflake. Key highlights of our Expanded Partner program include a newly launched streamline partner portal that centralizes MicroStrategy sales marketing technical assets to facilitate increased partner engagement, expanded training resources to empower partners and the necessary tools to excel and increase incentives and sales motions to grow synergy between MicroStrategy's and its partners' growth objectives. I'm very excited about our product in the direction of the company. Our goal is to be the innovation leader in AI and BI, and BI in the cloud. And we believe we're delivering on this objective. In Q4, we're continuing to work through plans to transform our sales organization to be cloud focused and capitalize on our innovation and the strength of our cloud platform. We're also creating customer success organization they'll be focused on better supporting customers, as they attempt to innovate and maximize value for the organization and customers. I look forward to sharing more details on these initiatives and our next earnings call. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss the updates on our Bitcoin holdings and our financials for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. I'll start with our third quarter operating results, which reflected year-over-year total revenue growth. And while macroeconomic headwinds have persisted over the past year, our Q3 results demonstrate, both the depths of our customer base and our ability, to generate revenue despite longer sales cycles, and tighter customer spend. GAAP total revenues for the quarter were $129.5 million, up $4.1 million or 3% year-over-year, or up 1% year-over-year at constant currency. Total software license revenues with which consists of product license revenues and subscription services revenues were $45 million, up 16% year-over-year, or up 14% at constant currency. Product licensed revenues were $24 million for the quarter of 8% year-over-year, or up 6% at constant currency. The growth in product license revenue in Q3 was primarily attributable to the execution of several large international deals during the quarter, and partially offset by lower domestic license revenues. We continue to expect our mix of revenue will continue to shift from product license to subscription services over time as we continue to transition to the cloud. However, this past quarter demonstrates that demand for our software remains strong across all platforms. Subscription services revenues, which reflect recurring revenues from our cloud business were $21 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year or 25% at constant currency. Product support revenues were $66.9 million, up 1% year-over-year or down to 1% at constant currency. Customer renewal rates remain high at 94% for the quarter, and have been consistently above 90% in the seven most consecutive quarters, illustrating the durability of our customers even in spite of the ongoing challenges in the macroeconomic environment. Finally, other services revenues were $17.6 million, which was a 15% decrease year-over-year, or 17% lower at constant currency. While we are seeing higher average consulting build rates worldwide, lower customer demand for consulting projects in the current and macroeconomic environment remain a headwind to customer spend on professional services. On Slide 13, total current software license billings were $42.7 million in the third quarter, an increase at 17% year-over-year, and current subscription billings were $16.8 million and an increase at 17% year-over-year our 14th straight quarter of double-digit growth. Transitioning customers to MicroStrategy Cloud remains one of our highest priorities, focusing on both new customer wins as well as migrating existing customers. As Phong mentioned earlier, we are well positioned to capitalize on first to market AI integrated features already available on MicroStrategy's platform. And our go-to-market strategy will be highly focused on driving cloud growth, AI/BI adoption and increasing partner enabled deployments and driving further marketplace integration with hyperscalers. We believe this will translate to new logos, faster migrations and accelerated cloud transition in the coming year. Shifting to costs on Slide 14, total non-GAAP expenses were $138 million in the third quarter, compared to approximately $102 million in the third quarter of 2022. $34 million of the expenses were due to the Q3 Bitcoin impairment charge, compared to - $1 million in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP cost of revenues was $25 million in the third quarter, which was an increase of $1.2 million or 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher cloud hosting costs as we grow our cloud business. However, as a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP cost of revenues remained flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased $1.9 million, or 6% year-over-year to $32.4 million. As a percentage of total revenues non-GAAP sales and marketing costs were just 1% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were $26 million, a slight 1% decrease year-over-year, and non-GAAP G&A costs were $20 million in Q3, which was flat year-over-year. Spending on cloud growth and investing in sales and marketing activities are directly targeted towards growing revenue and acquiring new customers. While focusing on strategic spend. We also successfully launched our AI product in Q3, while carefully managing product development costs through global delivery center efficiencies, and speed of execution. Our priority and results are rooted in the active management of costs in order to drive margin and profitable growth. Turning to Slide 15, we reported a total non-GAAP operating loss in the third quarter of $8 million, of which the non-cash digital asset impairment charge was $34 million for the quarter. For the third quarter, we reported a GAAP net loss of $143 million, which included a $110 million tax provision expense. This non-cash tax expense was related to the reestablishment of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset, directly related to our Bitcoin holdings. The expense was recognized, because the market value of Bitcoin on the reporting date of September 30 was below our aggregate cost basis. At the end of Q4, we will reevaluate the fair value of Bitcoin again at 12/31. And if the price of Bitcoin on that date is above our aggregate cost of holdings, we would readjust the valuation allowance at the end of Q4 and see a core spend corresponding non-cash tax benefit. Turning now to our Bitcoin strategy, we again increased our total Bitcoin holdings and acquired 5,912 Bitcoins in the third quarter. After the end of the quarter, we purchased an additional 155 Bitcoins using cash from operations. As of October 31, 2023, the company held a total of 158,400 Bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate cost of $4.7 billion or $29,586 per Bitcoin. Bitcoins purchased by MicroStrategy through cash generated by the software business are held at the MicroStrategy entity and as a result, those Bitcoins are pledged against our 2028 Senior Secured Notes. Bitcoins purchase their proceeds from Capital Markets activities, including equity and debt issuances are held at MicroStrategy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy. These Bitcoins are not pledged to our Senior Secured Notes and are fully unencumbered. In Q3, we purchased 5,445 Bitcoins for $147 million using net proceeds from our at the market equity program. And as noted a moment ago, these Bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy. We also purchased an additional 467 Bitcoins for $14.4 million using excess cash from operations, which are held at MicroStrategy. And subsequent to the end of the quarter and October, we use additional excess cash from operations to purchase the additional 155 Bitcoins for $5.3 million also held at MicroStrategy. Our Bitcoin strategy remains unchanged, which is to acquire and hold Bitcoin, and we plan to accumulate more Bitcoin over time using both excess cash from operations and proceeds from the capital markets. Bitcoin has outperformed much of the market this year and while we still see price volatility, as the asset class continues to mature, Bitcoin prices have stabilized over a narrow range - over a narrower range, compared to prior years. MicroStrategy is the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. And we remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with the highest conviction, long-term focus and with a strong risk managed approach. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2.5 billion, compared to approximately $4.3 billion in market value based on the Bitcoin price as of the last day of the quarter. As of market close on Tuesday, October 31, the market value of our 158,400 Bitcoins was approximately $5.5 billion. Our Bitcoin remains subject to the current indefinite lived intangible asset accounting rules under, which we must record an impairment, when there's any decrease in the fair value, below our carrying value at any time during the quarter, which occurred in Q3, when Bitcoin price fell to $24,900. We remain optimistic that FASB, will finalize the change in accounting rules for certain digital assets, including Bitcoin to fair value accounting in the near term. Now, turning to Slide 19. In Q3, we continue to execute power at the market our ATM equity offering and raised approximately $147.3 million in aggregate net proceeds through the sale of Class A common stock. In the current ATM program, we have issued 403,000 shares and have approximately $602 million of remaining ATM capacity. As with prior programs, we may use it proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the repurchase or repayment of our outstanding debt. The incremental ATM capacity will allow us to benefit from institutional demand for Bitcoin exposure, and will allow us to opportunistically raise capital to continue and creating value for our shareholders. Our outstanding debt and - convertible notes remain unchanged at a total $2.2 billion with a blended weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.6%. Also, at the end of the third quarter, we had $45 million in cash on our balance sheet, and sufficient overall liquidity to manage our ongoing operating needs and our outstanding debt. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have raised a total of approximately $1.9 billion in gross proceeds through our ATM programs, the average price over all issuances of approximately $419 per share. The primary use of historical ATM proceeds to-date has been to acquire additional Bitcoin, and we also use the proceeds to repay our $205 million Bitcoin back loan at a discount. Our capital allocation strategy - continues to be focused on improving our overall capital structure by strengthening our balance sheet through additional Bitcoin holdings and managing our debt very carefully. On Slide 21, as of October 31, we now hold a total of 158,400 Bitcoins, of which 15,886 Bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy the parent and are pledged as collateral securing our 2028 notes. The remaining 142,514 Bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy, all of which are unpledged, and unencumbered as of quarter end, representing 90% of our total Bitcoin holdings are $4.9 billion in current market value. The earliest of our debt maturities is not until December 2025 for the 2025 convertible notes, which is eight quarters away from today. Within that period of time, we also expect the Bitcoin halving to occur in Q2 of 2024. We actively monitor our capital structure and are constantly evaluating, liability management opportunities to manage and prepare for all upcoming debt. Overall, we believe the position, the positive position in our cloud business along with [technical difficulty] license sales in combination with the release of our first to market enterprise scale integrated AI/BI product, produces positive catalysts heading into the fourth quarter. That being said, we maintain the stance of cautious optimism due to the ongoing presence of macroeconomic headwinds. We anticipate total revenue this year to be in line with last year, we continue to focus on product innovation in AI and cloud. We will continue to grow cloud subscription revenues and strengthen the quality of our recurring revenue as we transform our platform. We will remain disciplined and continue to manage to drive margin expansion and we will continue to acquire and hold Bitcoin. Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you. Thanks for joining us today, I thought I would start with some - a quick performance review of MicroStrategy since we adopted our Bitcoin strategy. It's now approximately 37 months. So just slightly more than three years, since - we adopted our Bitcoin strategy. And we benchmark ourselves against all major asset classes and against big tech stocks, and also against enterprise software companies that our enterprise software peers. And I'm happy to report to you that our performance over this time period is plus 242%. And that exceeds the Bitcoin performance in the same period of 192%. So MicroStrategy is outperforming the Bitcoin asset index. The S&P is up 25% over that time period, so we've almost 10xed the S&P performance. The NASDAQ is up 17%. As you recall, we had to choose between gold and digital gold in August of 2020. And we chose digital gold that is Bitcoin, the actual gold is down 2%. So 192% versus minus 2%, is the difference, between choosing the right asset and the wrong asset. This totally makes sense, because we're living in an age of digital transformation and there's just a growing awareness that Bitcoin is the digital gold of the 21st century. Silver is down 18%, and that time period, and of course, bonds, which we were holding on our balance sheet, are down 24%. And we had a concern about holding bonds, because of the interest rate environment. That's why we wanted to buy some other tangible asset. As you can see, Bitcoin is almost the opposite of bonds. Bitcoin being, the accreting asset, bonds have been diluted to balance sheets, so we're holding them. MicroStrategy has outperformed all the big tech companies. And you can see here, Google, Microsoft, Apple Meta, and some of the big techs haven't even had a positive return in that time period. And MicroStrategy has almost 3x, the next best competitor in the enterprise software space. So I would say based upon this over this time period that, our Bitcoin strategy is working. In essence, we have transformed a company with a 500, a $500 million enterprise software company into a new kind of firm that has both a $500 million software business as well as a now a $5 billion plus digital assets business. And we're able to get benefits from both the business intelligence part of our business, as well as the Bitcoin part of our business. We can go to the next slide now. One of the things that's coming is, is more different options for institutional investors to get Bitcoin exposure. And oftentimes, people ask us, so what's the difference between MicroStrategy and just buying the Bitcoin outright? Or buying a Bitcoin futures ETF or buying grayscale or buying a potential spot Bitcoin ETF if and when they're available. And so, I think this chart is both useful to - useful to explain what makes MicroStrategy different. And you can also see in this chart, the structural reasons why we are able to outperform Bitcoin itself over this last three-year time period. If you're an investor, and you're looking for accessibility to Bitcoin as an asset class MicroStrategy is a ticker on NASDAQ MSTR. Whereas buying the Bitcoin itself as the commodity requires that you set up a new relationships with a crypto exchange and a crypto custodian and oftentimes investors just don't have those exchange and custody relationships. So it's not so easy to buy the underlying Bitcoin and in some cases, it's just not practical or not possible at all, that they wouldn't be allowed to do it, or they wouldn't have the mandate to do it. The futures ETF does provide that accessibility. The spot ETFs have not been available up until now. And of course, GBTC has been an over the counter product, and there are many institutional investors that struggle with over the counter aspects of access. So, that's been a benefit to us. The second differentiator has been our operating company structure. We are we are an operating company that is providing Bitcoin exposure. We're not a finance company. And that means we have some options. One option is we don't charge a fee. So if you're an investor in MicroStrategy, you don't get charged an annual fee or some sort of custody fee in order to be invested in our company. We cover the cost of custody using our operating cash flows and other cash flows from the operating business. If you were to buy Bitcoin itself, you normally have to place it with a custodian of your institutional investor, and so all institutional custodians charge a fee. There is an annual fee to invest in futures ETF as well. There will be fees to invest in spot ETFs and there has been a fee to invest in GBTC. So the ability to get Bitcoin exposure and not get charged a fee is another plus for us, a differentiator. The third differentiator is as an operating company, we can acquire Bitcoin with cash flows and we can organically accrete more Bitcoin. And we can do the cash flows, so we can do it with accretive financings of different sort, either accretive debt or accretive equity financings. And that's a plus. And these other options don't allow you to organically accrete Bitcoin. So that's another plus for institutional investors that are Bitcoin involves. The fourth differentiator is that as an operating company, we can use intelligent leverage. We can do asset-backed financing. We can do convertible financing. We can do senior secured debt financing. We could set up credit lines. So a lot of things an operating company can do that an ETP can't do. And of course, if you're just holding the underlying Bitcoin and a custodian, the Bitcoin is not going to leverage itself. And there really isn't, you don't have those sort of types of debt financing you can do against Bitcoin, a commodity right now as an institutional investor. So that has been a nice differentiator for us. And we have used that in order to create a product which is not just a straight Bitcoin investment. The $2.2 billion of debt with a 1.6% blended interest rate is an example of intelligent leverage. The fifth differentiator is that we have a non-Bitcoin business that we operate our enterprise software business. And we've been in that business for 30 years. And so, we're not just a pure Bitcoin play, but we provide some downside protection because we're able to rely upon cash flows and operating income from the enterprise software corporation. And of course, as a NASDAQ listed stock with a healthy spot volume, we have derivatives options. There are stock options that trade against MicroStrategy and you can use them for risk management if you want to buy, sell, trade volatility or hedge, you're able to do that. And those are options available to institutional investors on exchanges they understand. And those options are easily available to them with many of the other choices they have. So MicroStrategy is where we've created a unique investment vehicle. It's certainly not the only appropriate investment vehicle. And there are other investment vehicles that'll be more appropriate for different class of investors. And as we look forward to potential spot ETFs coming along, we think that's going to actually grow the market dramatically and it's going to be another great investment option for a different class of institutional investors that'll be beneficial to all. But we're committed to our Bitcoin operating model and being a hybrid enterprise software company and Bitcoin company taking advantage of our intelligent options when they present themselves in order to provide our investors with a unique opportunity to get long Bitcoin exposure in an intelligent fashion. So with that, I think I'll say just a few last words on the Bitcoin market outlook. First of all, there's a lot of discussion of spot ETPs. If and when they are approved, we certainly think that they're beneficial to the entire asset class. They will represent an on-ramp for capital on Wall Street to come into the Bitcoin ecosystem and they'll dramatically increase the availability of Bitcoin as an asset to both retail investors as well as institutional investors, corporate investors, and trust and endowments and the like. So, we think that there are many, many types of investors that will benefit from that product. I think that two other things that it does is it provides comfort to institutional investors, because when they see offerings from companies like BlackRock or Fidelity or Invesco that they're familiar with, then that's going to actually catalyze them to do research and to educate themselves. And we've already seen an improvement and an expansion and analytical coverage from Wall Street of the Bitcoin asset class. I think we'll see more and more analyst coverage from traditional Wall Street banks as these ETPs make Bitcoin exposure available. And so, more coverage, means more education, means more awareness, and that results in more interest and more on-ramps will facilitate that interest. And because Bitcoin has got a fixed supply as the demand increases, then we think that'll be bullish for the entire asset. The second major factor we think in the market outlook is going to be the halving. The halving is coming right now. It's forecast to be sometime in late April of 2024. Much of the organic selling demand or the organic supply available for sale of Bitcoin or natural sellers are Bitcoin miners. And after the halving, that natural supply available for sale will be cut in half, at least from the Bitcoin miners. And the Bitcoin miners are a substantial part of all the natural sellers in the market. So the halving should have a pretty dramatic material effect on the supply available for sale at the same time that the demand for the asset increases via spot Bitcoin ETPs. So we think that's bullish for the asset class. The third dynamic is going to be FASB's initiative toward fair value accounting. That can only be helpful in educating the market, clarifying the asset and creating more transparency that solves problems that corporations would have if they were to take on large material amounts of Bitcoin exposure. And this is not a near term, but more of a long-term driver, but its material as a long-term driver. A fourth interesting driver in the market, which is positive, is the entire crypto regulation developments and the progression of them. As the entire crypto industry continues to be regulated, I think that's creating more clarity and more comfort for institutional investors to be able to participate in this space. And so, I think we'll see positive regulatory initiatives that will create more clarity and more consistency and more comfort during the coming 12 months. I think another driver, which is material in the coming 12 months is macroeconomics. Both macroeconomic environment in the United States, as well as global macroeconomics, there is a continued global inflation and everywhere that pops up its head, its driving interest in Bitcoin and its catalyzing awareness. And I think the current macroeconomic environment with the Fed slowing down on tightening as it has, is positive. Certainly over the past year and a half with the interest rates going from almost nothing to more than 500 basis points, that's been a headwind. And now in the current environment, I don't think we expect similar types of macroeconomic headwinds. And just to pause on Federal Reserve activity that we've seen in the past two Fed announcements have been positive, I think, for the outlook for the Bitcoin asset class. Bitcoin technology integration efforts continue. I think it's another bullish trend. The development of lightning continues, and the activity of corporations to integrate the Bitcoin protocol and the base layer of Bitcoin, as well as integrate with lightning, are positive and auspicious and they continue. And I think that as time goes on, we're just going to see more and more technology initiatives that'll be beneficial in creating utility for Bitcoin throughout the entire retail community and business community. And then, I will end my thoughts with the observation that mainstream awareness seems to be reaching new heights for Bitcoin. We have the likes of Larry Fink referring to it as a Flight to Quality. We have Druckenmiller noting that it's a legitimate asset embraced by an entire generation and lamenting that he doesn't own more of it or own it. We have Mohammed El-Erian on television noting that Bitcoin is being viewed now as a safe haven asset. We have a lot of coverage of Bitcoin in television, on television networks, news networks, and also through mainstream media that should continue to grow. As that coverage increases, that combined with increasing availability of Wall Street analyst coverage and new voices emerging in the community, like Fidelity with their analysis of Bitcoin, all of those new voices and new interest is driving education of a new generation of investors. I think we can expect more of that during the coming 12 months. And all of these things together just create a virtual cycle. And as they drive Bitcoin awareness, they should drive Bitcoin investment and that should drive more news and that should drive more awareness and that should catalyze more and more firms to take an interest in supporting Bitcoin or investing in Bitcoin. And so with that, I will go ahead and end my review, and we can move on to Q&A.\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. We are now going to jump right into questions. And the first question is for Michael. The 10-Q discloses that Michael entered into a 10B51 plan to exercise MicroStrategy stock options. Can you please provide further color on the plan and the thought process?\nMichael Saylor: Sure, yes, thanks for that question. I was granted a stock option in 2014 with respect to 400,000 shares, which is going to expire next April if I don't exercise it by then. For almost a decade now at my request, the company has only paid me a $1 salary and I've chosen not to be eligible for any cash bonuses. Exercising this option will allow me to address some financial obligations as well as to acquire additional Bitcoin for my personal account. Under my trading plan, I plan to exercise and sell 5,000 shares on each trading day beginning on January 2nd, 2024 and ending on April 25th, subject to a minimum price condition. This means the sale will take place over almost four months. If you'd like more details about the plan, I would refer you to the 10-Q. I continue to be optimistic about MicroStrategy's prospects and should note that my equity stake in the company after these sales will remain very significant.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Michael. The next question is also for Michael. What is management's view on the impacts to the Bitcoin ecosystem at large if a spot Bitcoin ETF is approved? And what is management's view on the potential impact to MicroStrategy?\nMichael Saylor: I think that it's a catalytic event, a big milestone in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin as an asset class. So I think it's going to be very, very auspicious for the asset. I think it will usher in a new generation of analysts. It'll usher in a lot more Bitcoin awareness. It will simplify the process of acquiring and holding Bitcoin and allocating to Bitcoin by an order of magnitude. And I think it will create a constructive competition because all of these various ETF vendors will all be competing for asset share. And as they do it, it'll be in their best interest to communicate and educate all of their clients on Bitcoin. So I think it's very good for the ecosystem. I think it's complimentary as a way to participate in many other ways. There are already participants in the ecosystem that take different strategies. For example, Block has taken a very technology-focused strategy and they're very interested in integrating into their products like Cash App. MicroStrategy has assumed a Bitcoin strategy which consists of acquiring and holding the underlying asset. I think other companies have offered options type strategies and trading strategies. There are going to be a class of investors that will welcome the ability to hold the spot product through an ATP wrapper. And so, I think it's generally good for the ecosystem. As for MicroStrategy, I think it's going to be good for our company as well as our shareholders because it will expand the overall ecosystem. None of these ETP companies will be operating companies themselves. So they're not really pursuing our strategy of intelligent leverage as an operating company. They'll be pursuing various ETF and ETP type strategies. And overall that means that it should expand the entire asset class to the benefit of all participants.\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Michael. I think Shirish had a connection issue, so I'll read the next question we have. This one is for Phong. How should we be thinking about the AI partnerships with Microsoft and their monetization? Can you shed some color on the impact of AI offerings on margin?\nPhong Le: Yes, thanks, Andrew. So one of the ways we were able to be first to market with our AI BI offering is we fully embedded Microsoft Azure's OpenAI product through a partnership with Microsoft. And it provides several benefits to prospects and customers. One is they don't need to bring their own LLM, which if you're a large enterprise, you may not know exactly where to go, how to go do that. And so we've integrated it fully. The second is as of now, Azure OpenAI which drives technologies like ChatGPT is the superior LLM in the market. And so it's something that people are familiar with and know how to work with. And the third, we carry with it a lot of the privacy and security capabilities of Azure OpenAI too. That's our sort of first entree into the market. Over time, we do plan to integrate other LLMs from the hyperscalers. So whether it be Google or AWS and allow our customers to bring their own LLM or utilize a private LLM. So you'll be seeing that as we enter into 2024. As far as monetization, we're today, as I mentioned, pricing this at $20,000 for 20,000 questions, it's consumption-based. Obviously, the customer has to be using our current BI technology. And if they're not, they'll get MicroStrategy BI and the pricing associated with that and then add on AI on top of that. And I think as we get into 2024, we'll see some material revenue come out of this new product. We're already seeing some pretty strong pipeline. With MicroStrategy AI, and as I mentioned earlier, it's causing customers to want to move to our cloud because it's only available in the cloud. So that's another nice tailwind that is created by our new AI offering.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Phong. I can ask the next question, it's for Andrew. How does MicroStrategy think about the balance between investing in core business while utilizing excess cash flow to acquire more Bitcoin?\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Shirish. I'd say, if you recall, when we launched our Bitcoin strategy, we converted our cash reserves as well as our investment holdings into Bitcoin, which I think has served MicroStrategy to be extremely accretive. And Michael shared some of those statistics earlier. As part of our overall liquidity management, we ensure working capital, adequate working capital to manage all of our operations. We also ensure we have adequate capital to invest in product development and as well as service our debt. I'd say using excess cash from operations allows us to have the ability to organically create more Bitcoin. Again, that's served us very well and has driven a lot of value for our shareholders. So I'd expect us to continue along that strategy.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. The next question is for Andrew as well. Can you please provide thoughts if you have an expected timeline for FASB's fair value accounting rule implementation. And how the street should think about its impact on MicroStrategy's future Bitcoin acquisitions and the impact on core business?\nAndrew Kang: I'd say from conversations we've had with various folks related that are kind of aware of the FASB progress, it seems that the FASB is pretty much on track with what I would call maybe a normal timeline to finalize this accounting rule. I obviously can't predict when that'll occur, but I think we believe it is likely to happen based on that normal timeline either later this year or early next year. So I would say fairly in the near term. Overall, I think Michael talked about it as well, but the change I believe will help other institutions effectively, more effectively evaluate holding Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets and hopefully will provide additional transparency for more adoption of Bitcoin as well.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. Next question is for Michael. How does the recent move up in the price of Bitcoin impact the company's ongoing strategy to acquire more Bitcoin? Should we think of MicroStrategy as an average cost buyer adding to its Bitcoin stores as permitted by the capital markets and cash flow regardless of the price?\nMichael Saylor: We have a laser focus on Bitcoin acquisition. And so we will, the volatility and the price movement has had one primary impact, which is it has brought worldwide awareness to Bitcoin and it has gotten everybody focused on Bitcoin. So I think its accelerating education. And because Bitcoin is a novel asset class, education is critical for adoption. So I think generally it's long-term bullish. We try not to get too caught up in the volatility. So when we have excess cash flows from operations that we don't need as working capital, then we will generally acquire Bitcoin with it because we view it as accretive. And then when the capital markets offer us opportunities to do financing that are accretive to our shareholders so that we can buy Bitcoin, we will avail ourself of that. Those circumstances change month by month, quarter by quarter. And we have a good set of models that we use to keep track of all these changes. And we're always monitoring opportunities so as to make sure that we take advantage of it when it comes our way.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Michael. And we'll take one last question here, just for Phong. What are your thoughts on the remainder of the year and outlook for 2024, and main drivers of growth and challenges to keep an eye on? And what are some of the levers that can be pulled to increase profitability in the future?\nPhong Le: Yes, thanks, Shirish. I guess a few things. One is we look into 2024, the two big drivers of growth will be AI and cloud, and they're related. Migrating more customers to the cloud, getting them to adopt our cloud native platform, and getting customers to adopt AI, which in turn will get customers to adopt cloud, and moving more into the prospect space, because I think our AI and cloud offerings are quite prospect-friendly. So I think those would be the big drivers of growth. Concerns that we might have, macroeconomic headwinds. We saw that in the first half of this year, could rear back up. We have a lot of uncertainty right now, what's happening in the macroeconomic environment. And so those are the things that I think about. And as far as cash flows and margins go, I do think we can do everything that we mentioned while still being pretty disciplined about our margins, which I think you've seen us able to accrete margins in the last few quarters. And I think we can continue to do that.\nShirish Jajodia: So I think with that, I'm going to close this call. I want to thank everyone for being with us today, and we appreciate your support. We're enthusiastic as ever about our enterprise software strategy, as well as our Bitcoin strategy. I think we've seen positive momentum in both of those areas in the third quarter. And we wish you all a good quarter. Look forward to seeing you get in 12 weeks in 2024. Thanks all.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you. Thanks for joining us today, I thought I would start with some - a quick performance review of MicroStrategy since we adopted our Bitcoin strategy. It's now approximately 37 months. So just slightly more than three years, since - we adopted our Bitcoin strategy. And we benchmark ourselves against all major asset classes and against big tech stocks, and also against enterprise software companies that our enterprise software peers. And I'm happy to report to you that our performance over this time period is plus 242%. And that exceeds the Bitcoin performance in the same period of 192%. So MicroStrategy is outperforming the Bitcoin asset index. The S&P is up 25% over that time period, so we've almost 10xed the S&P performance. The NASDAQ is up 17%. As you recall, we had to choose between gold and digital gold in August of 2020. And we chose digital gold that is Bitcoin, the actual gold is down 2%. So 192% versus minus 2%, is the difference, between choosing the right asset and the wrong asset. This totally makes sense, because we're living in an age of digital transformation and there's just a growing awareness that Bitcoin is the digital gold of the 21st century. Silver is down 18%, and that time period, and of course, bonds, which we were holding on our balance sheet, are down 24%. And we had a concern about holding bonds, because of the interest rate environment. That's why we wanted to buy some other tangible asset. As you can see, Bitcoin is almost the opposite of bonds. Bitcoin being, the accreting asset, bonds have been diluted to balance sheets, so we're holding them. MicroStrategy has outperformed all the big tech companies. And you can see here, Google, Microsoft, Apple Meta, and some of the big techs haven't even had a positive return in that time period. And MicroStrategy has almost 3x, the next best competitor in the enterprise software space. So I would say based upon this over this time period that, our Bitcoin strategy is working. In essence, we have transformed a company with a 500, a $500 million enterprise software company into a new kind of firm that has both a $500 million software business as well as a now a $5 billion plus digital assets business. And we're able to get benefits from both the business intelligence part of our business, as well as the Bitcoin part of our business. We can go to the next slide now. One of the things that's coming is, is more different options for institutional investors to get Bitcoin exposure. And oftentimes, people ask us, so what's the difference between MicroStrategy and just buying the Bitcoin outright? Or buying a Bitcoin futures ETF or buying grayscale or buying a potential spot Bitcoin ETF if and when they're available. And so, I think this chart is both useful to - useful to explain what makes MicroStrategy different. And you can also see in this chart, the structural reasons why we are able to outperform Bitcoin itself over this last three-year time period. If you're an investor, and you're looking for accessibility to Bitcoin as an asset class MicroStrategy is a ticker on NASDAQ MSTR. Whereas buying the Bitcoin itself as the commodity requires that you set up a new relationships with a crypto exchange and a crypto custodian and oftentimes investors just don't have those exchange and custody relationships. So it's not so easy to buy the underlying Bitcoin and in some cases, it's just not practical or not possible at all, that they wouldn't be allowed to do it, or they wouldn't have the mandate to do it. The futures ETF does provide that accessibility. The spot ETFs have not been available up until now. And of course, GBTC has been an over the counter product, and there are many institutional investors that struggle with over the counter aspects of access. So, that's been a benefit to us. The second differentiator has been our operating company structure. We are we are an operating company that is providing Bitcoin exposure. We're not a finance company. And that means we have some options. One option is we don't charge a fee. So if you're an investor in MicroStrategy, you don't get charged an annual fee or some sort of custody fee in order to be invested in our company. We cover the cost of custody using our operating cash flows and other cash flows from the operating business. If you were to buy Bitcoin itself, you normally have to place it with a custodian of your institutional investor, and so all institutional custodians charge a fee. There is an annual fee to invest in futures ETF as well. There will be fees to invest in spot ETFs and there has been a fee to invest in GBTC. So the ability to get Bitcoin exposure and not get charged a fee is another plus for us, a differentiator. The third differentiator is as an operating company, we can acquire Bitcoin with cash flows and we can organically accrete more Bitcoin. And we can do the cash flows, so we can do it with accretive financings of different sort, either accretive debt or accretive equity financings. And that's a plus. And these other options don't allow you to organically accrete Bitcoin. So that's another plus for institutional investors that are Bitcoin involves. The fourth differentiator is that as an operating company, we can use intelligent leverage. We can do asset-backed financing. We can do convertible financing. We can do senior secured debt financing. We could set up credit lines. So a lot of things an operating company can do that an ETP can't do. And of course, if you're just holding the underlying Bitcoin and a custodian, the Bitcoin is not going to leverage itself. And there really isn't, you don't have those sort of types of debt financing you can do against Bitcoin, a commodity right now as an institutional investor. So that has been a nice differentiator for us. And we have used that in order to create a product which is not just a straight Bitcoin investment. The $2.2 billion of debt with a 1.6% blended interest rate is an example of intelligent leverage. The fifth differentiator is that we have a non-Bitcoin business that we operate our enterprise software business. And we've been in that business for 30 years. And so, we're not just a pure Bitcoin play, but we provide some downside protection because we're able to rely upon cash flows and operating income from the enterprise software corporation. And of course, as a NASDAQ listed stock with a healthy spot volume, we have derivatives options. There are stock options that trade against MicroStrategy and you can use them for risk management if you want to buy, sell, trade volatility or hedge, you're able to do that. And those are options available to institutional investors on exchanges they understand. And those options are easily available to them with many of the other choices they have. So MicroStrategy is where we've created a unique investment vehicle. It's certainly not the only appropriate investment vehicle. And there are other investment vehicles that'll be more appropriate for different class of investors. And as we look forward to potential spot ETFs coming along, we think that's going to actually grow the market dramatically and it's going to be another great investment option for a different class of institutional investors that'll be beneficial to all. But we're committed to our Bitcoin operating model and being a hybrid enterprise software company and Bitcoin company taking advantage of our intelligent options when they present themselves in order to provide our investors with a unique opportunity to get long Bitcoin exposure in an intelligent fashion. So with that, I think I'll say just a few last words on the Bitcoin market outlook. First of all, there's a lot of discussion of spot ETPs. If and when they are approved, we certainly think that they're beneficial to the entire asset class. They will represent an on-ramp for capital on Wall Street to come into the Bitcoin ecosystem and they'll dramatically increase the availability of Bitcoin as an asset to both retail investors as well as institutional investors, corporate investors, and trust and endowments and the like. So, we think that there are many, many types of investors that will benefit from that product. I think that two other things that it does is it provides comfort to institutional investors, because when they see offerings from companies like BlackRock or Fidelity or Invesco that they're familiar with, then that's going to actually catalyze them to do research and to educate themselves. And we've already seen an improvement and an expansion and analytical coverage from Wall Street of the Bitcoin asset class. I think we'll see more and more analyst coverage from traditional Wall Street banks as these ETPs make Bitcoin exposure available. And so, more coverage, means more education, means more awareness, and that results in more interest and more on-ramps will facilitate that interest. And because Bitcoin has got a fixed supply as the demand increases, then we think that'll be bullish for the entire asset. The second major factor we think in the market outlook is going to be the halving. The halving is coming right now. It's forecast to be sometime in late April of 2024.

And so with that, I will go ahead and end my review, and we can move on to Q&A. Sure, yes, thanks for that question.

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you, Phong. I'll start with our third quarter operating results, which reflected year-over-year total revenue growth. And while macroeconomic headwinds have persisted over the past year, our Q3 results demonstrate, both the depths of our customer base and our ability, to generate revenue despite longer sales cycles, and tighter customer spend. GAAP total revenues for the quarter were $129.5 million, up $4.1 million or 3% year-over-year, or up 1% year-over-year at constant currency. Total software license revenues with which consists of product license revenues and subscription services revenues were $45 million, up 16% year-over-year, or up 14% at constant currency. Product licensed revenues were $24 million for the quarter of 8% year-over-year, or up 6% at constant currency. The growth in product license revenue in Q3 was primarily attributable to the execution of several large international deals during the quarter, and partially offset by lower domestic license revenues. We continue to expect our mix of revenue will continue to shift from product license to subscription services over time as we continue to transition to the cloud. However, this past quarter demonstrates that demand for our software remains strong across all platforms. Subscription services revenues, which reflect recurring revenues from our cloud business were $21 million, an increase of 28% year-over-year or 25% at constant currency. Product support revenues were $66.9 million, up 1% year-over-year or down to 1% at constant currency. Customer renewal rates remain high at 94% for the quarter, and have been consistently above 90% in the seven most consecutive quarters, illustrating the durability of our customers even in spite of the ongoing challenges in the macroeconomic environment. Finally, other services revenues were $17.6 million, which was a 15% decrease year-over-year, or 17% lower at constant currency. While we are seeing higher average consulting build rates worldwide, lower customer demand for consulting projects in the current and macroeconomic environment remain a headwind to customer spend on professional services. On Slide 13, total current software license billings were $42.7 million in the third quarter, an increase at 17% year-over-year, and current subscription billings were $16.8 million and an increase at 17% year-over-year our 14th straight quarter of double-digit growth. Transitioning customers to MicroStrategy Cloud remains one of our highest priorities, focusing on both new customer wins as well as migrating existing customers. As Phong mentioned earlier, we are well positioned to capitalize on first to market AI integrated features already available on MicroStrategy's platform. And our go-to-market strategy will be highly focused on driving cloud growth, AI/BI adoption and increasing partner enabled deployments and driving further marketplace integration with hyperscalers. We believe this will translate to new logos, faster migrations and accelerated cloud transition in the coming year. Shifting to costs on Slide 14, total non-GAAP expenses were $138 million in the third quarter, compared to approximately $102 million in the third quarter of 2022. $34 million of the expenses were due to the Q3 Bitcoin impairment charge, compared to - $1 million in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP cost of revenues was $25 million in the third quarter, which was an increase of $1.2 million or 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher cloud hosting costs as we grow our cloud business. However, as a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP cost of revenues remained flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased $1.9 million, or 6% year-over-year to $32.4 million. As a percentage of total revenues non-GAAP sales and marketing costs were just 1% higher year-over-year. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were $26 million, a slight 1% decrease year-over-year, and non-GAAP G&A costs were $20 million in Q3, which was flat year-over-year. Spending on cloud growth and investing in sales and marketing activities are directly targeted towards growing revenue and acquiring new customers. While focusing on strategic spend. We also successfully launched our AI product in Q3, while carefully managing product development costs through global delivery center efficiencies, and speed of execution. Our priority and results are rooted in the active management of costs in order to drive margin and profitable growth. Turning to Slide 15, we reported a total non-GAAP operating loss in the third quarter of $8 million, of which the non-cash digital asset impairment charge was $34 million for the quarter. For the third quarter, we reported a GAAP net loss of $143 million, which included a $110 million tax provision expense. This non-cash tax expense was related to the reestablishment of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset, directly related to our Bitcoin holdings. The expense was recognized, because the market value of Bitcoin on the reporting date of September 30 was below our aggregate cost basis. At the end of Q4, we will reevaluate the fair value of Bitcoin again at 12/31. And if the price of Bitcoin on that date is above our aggregate cost of holdings, we would readjust the valuation allowance at the end of Q4 and see a core spend corresponding non-cash tax benefit. Turning now to our Bitcoin strategy, we again increased our total Bitcoin holdings and acquired 5,912 Bitcoins in the third quarter. After the end of the quarter, we purchased an additional 155 Bitcoins using cash from operations. As of October 31, 2023, the company held a total of 158,400 Bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate cost of $4.7 billion or $29,586 per Bitcoin. Bitcoins purchased by MicroStrategy through cash generated by the software business are held at the MicroStrategy entity and as a result, those Bitcoins are pledged against our 2028 Senior Secured Notes. Bitcoins purchase their proceeds from Capital Markets activities, including equity and debt issuances are held at MicroStrategy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy. These Bitcoins are not pledged to our Senior Secured Notes and are fully unencumbered. In Q3, we purchased 5,445 Bitcoins for $147 million using net proceeds from our at the market equity program. And as noted a moment ago, these Bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy. We also purchased an additional 467 Bitcoins for $14.4 million using excess cash from operations, which are held at MicroStrategy. And subsequent to the end of the quarter and October, we use additional excess cash from operations to purchase the additional 155 Bitcoins for $5.3 million also held at MicroStrategy. Our Bitcoin strategy remains unchanged, which is to acquire and hold Bitcoin, and we plan to accumulate more Bitcoin over time using both excess cash from operations and proceeds from the capital markets. Bitcoin has outperformed much of the market this year and while we still see price volatility, as the asset class continues to mature, Bitcoin prices have stabilized over a narrow range - over a narrower range, compared to prior years. MicroStrategy is the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world. And we remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with the highest conviction, long-term focus and with a strong risk managed approach. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2.5 billion, compared to approximately $4.3 billion in market value based on the Bitcoin price as of the last day of the quarter. As of market close on Tuesday, October 31, the market value of our 158,400 Bitcoins was approximately $5.5 billion. Our Bitcoin remains subject to the current indefinite lived intangible asset accounting rules under, which we must record an impairment, when there's any decrease in the fair value, below our carrying value at any time during the quarter, which occurred in Q3, when Bitcoin price fell to $24,900. We remain optimistic that FASB, will finalize the change in accounting rules for certain digital assets, including Bitcoin to fair value accounting in the near term. Now, turning to Slide 19. In Q3, we continue to execute power at the market our ATM equity offering and raised approximately $147.3 million in aggregate net proceeds through the sale of Class A common stock. In the current ATM program, we have issued 403,000 shares and have approximately $602 million of remaining ATM capacity. As with prior programs, we may use it proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the repurchase or repayment of our outstanding debt. The incremental ATM capacity will allow us to benefit from institutional demand for Bitcoin exposure, and will allow us to opportunistically raise capital to continue and creating value for our shareholders. Our outstanding debt and - convertible notes remain unchanged at a total $2.2 billion with a blended weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.6%. Also, at the end of the third quarter, we had $45 million in cash on our balance sheet, and sufficient overall liquidity to manage our ongoing operating needs and our outstanding debt. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have raised a total of approximately $1.9 billion in gross proceeds through our ATM programs, the average price over all issuances of approximately $419 per share. The primary use of historical ATM proceeds to-date has been to acquire additional Bitcoin, and we also use the proceeds to repay our $205 million Bitcoin back loan at a discount. Our capital allocation strategy - continues to be focused on improving our overall capital structure by strengthening our balance sheet through additional Bitcoin holdings and managing our debt very carefully. On Slide 21, as of October 31, we now hold a total of 158,400 Bitcoins, of which 15,886 Bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy the parent and are pledged as collateral securing our 2028 notes. The remaining 142,514 Bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy, all of which are unpledged, and unencumbered as of quarter end, representing 90% of our total Bitcoin holdings are $4.9 billion in current market value. The earliest of our debt maturities is not until December 2025 for the 2025 convertible notes, which is eight quarters away from today. Within that period of time, we also expect the Bitcoin halving to occur in Q2 of 2024. We actively monitor our capital structure and are constantly evaluating, liability management opportunities to manage and prepare for all upcoming debt. Overall, we believe the position, the positive position in our cloud business along with [technical difficulty] license sales in combination with the release of our first to market enterprise scale integrated AI/BI product, produces positive catalysts heading into the fourth quarter. That being said, we maintain the stance of cautious optimism due to the ongoing presence of macroeconomic headwinds. We anticipate total revenue this year to be in line with last year, we continue to focus on product innovation in AI and cloud. We will continue to grow cloud subscription revenues and strengthen the quality of our recurring revenue as we transform our platform. We will remain disciplined and continue to manage to drive margin expansion and we will continue to acquire and hold Bitcoin. Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Thanks, Michael. I think Shirish had a connection issue, so I'll read the next question we have. This one is for Phong. How should we be thinking about the AI partnerships with Microsoft and their monetization? Can you shed some color on the impact of AI offerings on margin? Thanks, Shirish. I'd say, if you recall, when we launched our Bitcoin strategy, we converted our cash reserves as well as our investment holdings into Bitcoin, which I think has served MicroStrategy to be extremely accretive. And Michael shared some of those statistics earlier. As part of our overall liquidity management, we ensure working capital, adequate working capital to manage all of our operations. We also ensure we have adequate capital to invest in product development and as well as service our debt. I'd say using excess cash from operations allows us to have the ability to organically create more Bitcoin. Again, that's served us very well and has driven a lot of value for our shareholders. So I'd expect us to continue along that strategy. I'd say from conversations we've had with various folks related that are kind of aware of the FASB progress, it seems that the FASB is pretty much on track with what I would call maybe a normal timeline to finalize this accounting rule. I obviously can't predict when that'll occur, but I think we believe it is likely to happen based on that normal timeline either later this year or early next year. So I would say fairly in the near term. Overall, I think Michael talked about it as well, but the change I believe will help other institutions effectively, more effectively evaluate holding Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets and hopefully will provide additional transparency for more adoption of Bitcoin as well."

            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's earnings webinar. I'll start with the highlights of our software business. Total revenue was $129.5 million, representing an increase of 3% year-over-year, total software licenses revenues which consists of total product licenses and subscription services revenues. And our consolidated statement of operations were $45 million, representing an increase of 16% year-over-year. Total software licenses revenues performance benefited for both increased adoption of our cloud platform and growth in product license revenues. Total subscription services revenue was $21 million and increase at 28% year-over-year. Our Q3 subscription billings growth was 17% year-over-year. We achieve good revenue results in Q3 with year-over-year growth driven by our cloud business and a strong international license revenue quarter. We plan to continue to drive growth in our recurring revenue model, and to transition our business strategy and product offerings to a cloud native model. Our focus will be on innovation at the intersection of artificial intelligence and business intelligence, using our first to market advantage in the enterprise scale integration of AI and BI to grow revenue in the cloud. I'm excited about the work we're doing in these areas and to share some updates with you and our progress. We're at a major period of innovation in the technology industry. We believe the next innovation is to change how the world does business or digital money, with the continuing development of the Bitcoin ecosystem in digital intelligence through AI. The technological leaps that occurred in the past year in generative AI are real, and we expect to be at the forefront of integrating AI with BI. MicroStrategy is well positioned to gain competitive leverage in winning both of these areas of growth. MicroStrategy's mission for the past 30 plus years has been to enable intelligence everywhere for our customers. And with this mission ingrained in our corporate D&A through each major tech innovation, we have moved closer to accomplishing this goal. Whether this was OLAP technologies on relational databases, implementing client-based desktop BI tools, introducing the semantic layer, rolling out web BI, or making the shift to mobile and then cloud, each step has successfully enabled to making BI a more ubiquitous component of business decision making. We believe generative AI is the next big innovation that will bring us closer to intelligence everywhere. Before diving into the integration of Gen AI and our platform, it's important to distinguish why MicroStrategy is poised to drive value in the AI space beyond the generic applications and hype built up in the broader market. Hyperscalers and mega software companies are investing billions amassing GPUs in legions of data scientists, to build the best large language models or LLM in the world. Much like we have done with cloud hyperscalers, we plan to openly partner with and leverage the technology investments in these companies. Rather than invest heavily to build our own models. Hundreds of smaller AI companies are taking a similar approach to us. But we're already differentiating as we have done for decades in BI across four major areas. Our 30 years of - number one, our 30 years of enterprise software services and sales capabilities. Number two, our trusted, secure scalable reusable data layer, what we call our semantic layer. Number three, the ability to quickly build and deploy actual applications utilizing this data through technologies like mobile, embedding and microservices. And number four, an open multi-cloud architecture, which in this case, we will use to easily integrate multiple different LLS. We believe this uniquely positions us to win at the intersection of artificial intelligence, and business intelligence. In addition, we believe the combination of AI and BI to be critical for enterprises looking to integrate AI into their day-to-day decision making. Let me explain. BI is precise, use trusted calculations from secured sources of structured data to make informed decisions. But on the other hand, BI can be rigid and difficult to engage with all levels to personas and business users. AI is smart, leveraging natural language generation reasoning and unstructured data to answer freeform questions and ideas. However, results can be untrustworthy in producing determinate answers that, are reliable and consistent enough to make informed business decisions. This is where MicroStrategy one delivers value bridging and precise BI and smart AI. Right now many enterprise AI solutions are focused on efficiency and cost gains. Building applications to help marketers write better, corporate teams process more efficiently and engineers code faster. There's even more value to be unlocked when AI helps analysts make better business decisions to drive top line growth and achieve true strategic advantage. This can be done with generative AI on top of enterprise data. But in doing so combining AI and BI and the challenges with scale, governance and trust with AI are amplified and security and access control are paramount. We expect to see increased customer demand as our platform tackles the primary hurdles customers face with AI adoption. The main customer concerns of enterprise AI or one, data access and security. Two, integration of large language models, natural language processing, and prompt engineering solutions. And three, the ability of distributed AI solutions of scale. Typical AI and BI combinations did that - do not have a semantic layer have unreliable intelligence. The BI tool acts as a simple repository that provides data to the generative AI engine. There's no intelligence in the LLM results, producing false or inaccurate responses commonly referred to as hallucination. MicroStrategy ONE and MicroStrategy AI leveraged the semantic layer to define all data objects within a customer configuration. Our BI architecture provides a framework and structure to the AI solution. The AI and MicroStrategy engineers collaborate to generate higher - quality queries by enhancing and tagging user prompts to pull more tailored results from customer data. MicroStrategy AI is designed to generate answers that are secure, accurate, scalable, and reliable. In September, we introduced our first set of MicroStrategy AI features to the market, which leverages our advanced BI system, fully embedding Microsoft Azure open AI. This release marks one of the most exciting product innovations in the history of the company. These new AI features are cloud native, and only available through MicroStrategy One. We've implemented four features to address, the needs of different business users. One, Auto SQL streamlines the database interaction process. This feature is intended to enhance the technical user experience on MicroStrategy. Our AI application can translate natural language into SQL queries, explain the SQL statements and natural language and review SQL code with suggested optimizations. Two, Auto Dashboard provides automatic dashboard creation, transforming complex data into interactive and beautiful visual insights. MicroStrategy AI processes, the data and can produce it beautiful and viable dashboard. Auto Expert is the automated support tool. It's like having a MicroStrategy employee guide you through the BI platform to answer user base questions such as how do I build an advanced metric? Auto Expert is available for free to all registered users on our website. And Auto Answer is my personal favorite transform self-service analytics, the user engages in natural language conversation, asking the AI system questions related to their data. For example, what is the forecast of revenue for Q1, 2025? What are the drivers of revenue growth? MicroStrategy AI processes the request, we contextualize data to provide rapidly - to rapidly provide answers with a deep level of understanding fastly increasing the data exploration capabilities of a basic user. MicroStrategy AI is the first to market with a fully integrated AI/BI platform and delivers BI features that enable enterprise grade AI deployment. With short as the customers' time to value and enhances the ability to optimize and automate. Furthermore, cloud native solution, drives net new business to the cloud while incentivizing current customers to migrate and expand their footprint. And its offering is also our first entry into consumption-based pricing. Customers will consume the AI product question-by-question. Our initial starter package is $20,000 to 20,000 questions or simply $1 a question. We expect this pricing mechanism to drive adoption and grow the subscription revenue stream while providing a relatively low cost of entry for customers to onboard next generation AI applications. We're already seeing this product driving existing on-premise customers to move to the cloud, or set up a new environment in the cloud to adopt MicroStrategy AI. Our vision for intelligence everywhere continues to inform our roadmap. We believe that AI/BI best empowers customers when it is modular and can be embedded into existing workflows. We also believe that the data that feeds AI/BI the platforms in which it runs and the LLM and machine learning models used - must be flexible and open to fit our customers' needs. Therefore, our roadmap includes the ability to build analytic bots on the platform, as the customers' choice, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or private cloud and leverage a variety of LLM are the customers' choice. To build your own bot tool and the MicroStrategy platform harnesses advanced capabilities in enterprise security, such as governance, integration with third-party tools and system auditability, to allow customers to easily deploy chatbots for broad use untrusted data. This feature is standalone and customizable for deployment by any user and the use cases are myriad. For example, internal users can deploy and FP&A chatbot to answer questions related to budget, or users can develop a product Q&A chatbot for customers on their website. We currently expect to build your own bot capability to be available in December of this year. We're excited about our initial AI offerings to the market and for the future as we continue to tap into the potential of AI/BI solutions in our product roadmap. Now, moving to developments on our cloud offer. We continue to build modern, scalable, resilient and cloud native applications that can transition customers from monolithic BI configurations to a microservices architecture that embraces flexibility, agility, and technological diversity. Microservices architecture and containerized structure enables applications to be deployed and scaled independently. These design features are necessary to meet the technological demands of AI, and to maintain the highest level of platform functionality. MicroStrategy Cloud architecture is designed in the cloud for multi-cloud. In Q4, we plan to deploy our Google Cloud implementation, increase your functionality to all three primary hyperscalers and further driving integration of AI and BI to every part of a customer's business. This is a fully containerized microservices based solution, which is the base modern cloud architecture for our MicroStrategy platform. MicroStrategy is now also available on both Azure and AWS marketplaces, firming up our partnership with these hyperscalers. We're also innovating the way we sell our product via partner sales channels with strategic focus aimed to unlock growth, enhance customer success and deepened market penetration in a rapidly evolving AI and BI market. We've announced recent partnerships with Microsoft Azure, including with open AI, AWS, and Snowflake. Key highlights of our Expanded Partner program include a newly launched streamline partner portal that centralizes MicroStrategy sales marketing technical assets to facilitate increased partner engagement, expanded training resources to empower partners and the necessary tools to excel and increase incentives and sales motions to grow synergy between MicroStrategy's and its partners' growth objectives. I'm very excited about our product in the direction of the company. Our goal is to be the innovation leader in AI and BI, and BI in the cloud. And we believe we're delivering on this objective. In Q4, we're continuing to work through plans to transform our sales organization to be cloud focused and capitalize on our innovation and the strength of our cloud platform. We're also creating customer success organization they'll be focused on better supporting customers, as they attempt to innovate and maximize value for the organization and customers. I look forward to sharing more details on these initiatives and our next earnings call. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss the updates on our Bitcoin holdings and our financials for the quarter in further detail. Yes, thanks, Andrew. So one of the ways we were able to be first to market with our AI BI offering is we fully embedded Microsoft Azure's OpenAI product through a partnership with Microsoft. And it provides several benefits to prospects and customers. One is they don't need to bring their own LLM, which if you're a large enterprise, you may not know exactly where to go, how to go do that. And so we've integrated it fully. The second is as of now, Azure OpenAI which drives technologies like ChatGPT is the superior LLM in the market. And so it's something that people are familiar with and know how to work with. And the third, we carry with it a lot of the privacy and security capabilities of Azure OpenAI too. That's our sort of first entree into the market. Over time, we do plan to integrate other LLMs from the hyperscalers. So whether it be Google or AWS and allow our customers to bring their own LLM or utilize a private LLM. So you'll be seeing that as we enter into 2024. As far as monetization, we're today, as I mentioned, pricing this at $20,000 for 20,000 questions, it's consumption-based. Obviously, the customer has to be using our current BI technology. And if they're not, they'll get MicroStrategy BI and the pricing associated with that and then add on AI on top of that. And I think as we get into 2024, we'll see some material revenue come out of this new product. We're already seeing some pretty strong pipeline. With MicroStrategy AI, and as I mentioned earlier, it's causing customers to want to move to our cloud because it's only available in the cloud. So that's another nice tailwind that is created by our new AI offering. Yes, thanks, Shirish. I guess a few things. One is we look into 2024, the two big drivers of growth will be AI and cloud, and they're related. Migrating more customers to the cloud, getting them to adopt our cloud native platform, and getting customers to adopt AI, which in turn will get customers to adopt cloud, and moving more into the prospect space, because I think our AI and cloud offerings are quite prospect-friendly. So I think those would be the big drivers of growth. Concerns that we might have, macroeconomic headwinds. We saw that in the first half of this year, could rear back up. We have a lot of uncertainty right now, what's happening in the macroeconomic environment. And so those are the things that I think about. And as far as cash flows and margins go, I do think we can do everything that we mentioned while still being pretty disciplined about our margins, which I think you've seen us able to accrete margins in the last few quarters. And I think we can continue to do that."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Phong Le, President and CEO of MicroStrategy. Phong?\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar, and I'll start with the highlights of our software business. Our total revenue results in the second quarter of 2023 were mixed with challenges in product license revenue, balanced by strength in our cloud business. Revenues were primarily impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment leading to longer and delayed sales cycles. Growth in our recurring revenue illustrates the durability of our enterprise-grade platform and continued traction in cloud. We also saw continued strong profitability as we thoughtfully manage our cost structure. Total revenue was $120.4 million, representing a decrease of 1% year-over-year or flat on a constant-currency basis. Total software license revenues, which consist of total product licenses and subscription services revenues were $35.4 million, representing an increase of 4% year-over-year or 7% on a constant-currency basis. Total software license revenue performance benefited from increased adoption of our cloud platform, which was partially offset by a decrease in product license revenues. Total subscription services revenue was $19.9 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year or 44% on a constant-currency basis. And our Q2 subscription billings growth was 15% year-over-year. Even though difficult macroeconomic conditions continue to persist and may continue to impact our revenue in the coming quarters, MicroStrategy continues to invest in and focus on innovation, and I'm excited to tell you more about our product developments. At our MicroStrategy World User Conference held in person in May 2023, we highlighted and introduced MicroStrategy1, our enterprise AI/BI platform. In our keynote address, we highlighted how some of the biggest brands in the world, including organizations like Hilton Hotels, Amica Insurance, and Sony Interactive Entertainment leverage the power and unified capabilities of MicroStrategy to transform how they operate and succeed amidst fierce competition. With an eye to the future, we unveiled our vision of Intelligence Everywhere in the age of artificial intelligence and what our engineering team is building today. We also announced the development of our Lightning Rewards product, an innovative approach to monetizing interactions, which leverages the Lightning Network, the bitcoin Layer 2 payment protocol. And we've heard from industry experts across the bitcoin and Lightning Network ecosystems about the practical application of the Lightning Network for business today and tomorrow. Our new MicroStrategy ONE platform is the most important product innovation in the history of our company because it represents a fundamental shift in our industry to harness the power of business intelligence and artificial intelligence together to upgrade the way organizations do business. Said plainly, AI and BI are better together, and MicroStrategy has unique advantages for developing an AI/BI platform. Let me explain. This next-generation product suite is built to unleash new levels of efficiency and creativity. Organizations are looking to consolidate vendors to save costs, simplify deployment and maximize impact. They are looking to deploy AI-enabled applications to drive efficiency, productivity and impact to their operations. MicroStrategy ONE offers a comprehensive solution of flexibility and scale to address all types of use cases. We're extremely proud of the work done to build MicroStrategy ONE and are excited for customers and prospects alike to experience how it changes the way they think about the feature of AI and BI. MicroStrategy is well-positions how our organizations build and deploy AI applications to users by leveraging the core capabilities of our leading BI platform. In our experience, 80% of the complexity in building AI applications and solutions is procuring, transforming, organizing, securing and maintaining data. The challenges with scale, governance and trust with AI are amplified by an order of magnitude compared to traditional BI, and security and access control is paramount. All these are very similar to large-scale massive analytics deployments, something we believe we do best. By leveraging an open cloud-native compostable architecture, access to structured and unstructured inputs in a semantic graph connected to advanced deep learning and large language models we believe we have a proven framework for success. With the launch of the MicroStrategy ONE platform, we are now able to increasingly focus on MicroStrategy's hallmark, product innovation. Our innovation is focused on native cloud, artificial Intelligence and the Lightning Network. Building on the launch of MicroStrategy ONE in May, we'll be sharing details online and in-person around the globe starting in September. MicroStrategy Cloud is the foundation of MicroStrategy ONE and a key area of our research and development investments. The flexibility and scalability and security required to embrace AI further underscore the importance we have seen in this area in the more traditional analytics space. The power of multi-cloud deployment and containerized microservices architecture, enterprise-grade security, proactive cloud management from experts, seamless migration and backups, and single-click updates and upgrades allow cloud customers to appreciate immediate benefits of our platform. The comprehensive set of tools on our platform and scalable data governance ensures customers benefit from the ability to make fast, accurate and informed decisions, while accelerating access to the technology of the feature. These needs necessitate a cloud-first cloud-native approach that will be transformative for customers, and as such, will be an area of continued focus for us. Talking further about our AI innovation, the Q3 upgrade to our AI/BI platform planned for release this September will bring advanced AI capabilities in a new dimension. MicroStrategy AI empowering organizations to rapidly deploy, secure, govern and trusted AI applications. We brought the same care and expertise around data definitions [indiscernible], multi-source data access and governance from the traditional BI world and our approach to AI. The MicroStrategy semantic graph combined with generative AI and deep learning will enable organizations to better understand their data and their relationships, resulting in more accurate predictions, better data quality, improved model training and output and faster actionable insights. MicroStrategy's AI innovation focuses on productivity to empower each type of user within an organization to become more intelligent. As an example, MicroStrategy data whisperer supports the business user, providing access to an AI-powered Chatbot, that surfaces answers and self-service insights that understand the why behind the data. Companies can make every consumer a data scientist by extending these experience through MicroStrategy Insights. By asking questions via chat, users can unlock advanced algorithms that detect data patterns, outliers, anomalies, key drivers and more. Insights uses AI models and evaluates incoming data to surface insights immediately to the user via web and email alerts. For the analysts and authors simply ask your point, our AI assistant at your dataset of choice and once you build a Dossier that provides a 360-degree analysis of the data in seconds. Looking forward holistically, we're developing further capabilities to extend how our line of business owners can accelerate business results across industries and departments as well as the composability of the platform to embed AI workflows and productivity into applications. As we look to expand our customer base and drive revenue growth, strategic alliances will become increasingly important. In Q2, we expanded our relationship with Microsoft, announcing a multiyear partnership that integrates the Azure OpenAI service and Microsoft 365 with MicroStrategy's advanced analytics capabilities and makes MicroStrategy available on the Azure Marketplace. Open AI has emerged as the leader in generative AI and we're excited about the Azure service and our further marketplace offering that enhances the access, speed and capabilities of MicroStrategy ONE for all our customers', current and future. The partnership between MicroStrategy and Microsoft will empower business users to make faster, more informed decisions and accelerate the development and deployment of new AI applications. Additionally, as discussed at the MicroStrategy World conference, we're actively working on our Google Cloud platform relationship and we expect to share further updates in Q4. Turning to our development of MicroStrategy Lightning, which utilizes the second layer of Lightning Network sitting on top of the bitcoin network, we envision MicroStrategy Lightning as an enterprise platform designed to leverage the power of the Bitcoin Lightning Network to enable new e-commerce use cases and tackle modern cybersecurity challenges. The first use case of the MicroStrategy Lightning platform is Lightning Rewards, which is intended to allow any enterprise to reward their employees, customers, partners and prospects for their engagement. Companies spend vast amounts of time and money in digital marketing, driving engagement with their brand and their customer, and for some, monetizing online content. We believe a platform like MicroStrategy Lightning can enable them to drive that engagement and reward their customers with that engagement directly rather than aligning the pockets of marketing or financial intermediaries. We expect future capabilities of Lightning platform will provide opportunities for new business models to monetize online content or minimize threats and the nuisance of bots and other malicious actors. While we envision Lightning as an independent product offering, it builds on our core strengths and deep expertise building highly available, easy-to-use enterprise software delivered in the cloud. While our focus remains on BI innovation, we believe we are uniquely positioned to bring value here. These incremental areas of product focus and innovation will drive MicroStrategy's strategy of being at the forefront of analytics. Turning to our Bitcoin strategy, we continue increasing our Bitcoin holdings in the second quarter. In Q2, we acquired 12,333 bitcoins, the most in a single quarter since the second quarter of 2021. After the end of Q2, we purchased an additional 467 bitcoins using cash from our operations. As of July 31, 2023, the company held 152,800 bitcoins acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion or $29,672 per bitcoin. As you know, our strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin and we plan to continue to accumulate bitcoin over time using excess cash and with the net proceeds of capital markets transactions. Our core business is not impacted by near-term bitcoin price fluctuations. MicroStrategy is the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin in the world and we remain committed to our bitcoin acquisition strategy with a high degree of conviction, long-term focus and a risk-managed approach. Finally, before I hand it over to Andrew, I like to take a moment to discuss personnel changes this quarter. Our Chief Revenue Officer, Kevin Adkisson announced his resignation earlier in July. It's been my privilege to work with Kevin for nearly seven years and we wish him luck with his future endeavors. With Kevin's departure, I've assumed his responsibilities of head of the sales organization and sales function. I enjoy working directly with our field leaders and team as well as meeting with customers, and this will give me an opportunity to spend more time in this area. Additionally, we're excited to welcome back Saurabh Abhyankar, back to MicroStrategy as our Chief Product Officer. Saurabh brings more than 20 years of industry experience to the role and has previously served at MicroStrategy as the Senior Vice President of Product Management and also Executive Vice President of Marketing. Thus, we continue to opportunistically hire top talent worldwide. In addition, we started to return to the office to enable our employees to make the best of the convenience offered by the hybrid work model, while also benefiting from in-person interactions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. I'll start by recapping some of the key GAAP financial results for the quarter. GAAP total revenues for Q2 were $120.4 million, down $1.7 million or 1% year-over-year and flat year-over-year at constant currency. Total software license revenues, which consist of product license revenues and subscription services revenues were $35.4 million, up 4% year-over-year and up 7% at constant currency. Subscription service revenues which reflect recurring revenues from our cloud business were $19.9 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year or an increase of 44% at constant currency. Product license revenues were $15.5 million for the quarter, down 23% year-over-year or down 20% at constant currency. While we saw some ongoing headwinds from the overall challenging macroenvironment this past quarter, our results continue to reflect the expected decline in product license revenues as we transition our BI business to the cloud. We expect the mix of this revenue will continue to shift from product license to subscription services as we transition the platform over time. Product support revenues were $66.1 million, down 1% year-over-year and down 1% in constant currency. Customer renewal rates were 93% for the quarter and remained above 90% for the sixth consecutive quarter continuing to demonstrate the durability of our customer base even with a tough macroeconomic backdrop. Lastly, other services revenues were $18.9 million or 12% decrease year-over-year or 11% at constant currency, primarily due to lower consulting revenues. While we have seen higher average build rates worldwide, we did experience lower customer demand for consulting services in the quarter. However, we do expect consulting engagements to normalize in the second half of the year. On Slide 16, total current software license billings were $39.1 million in the second quarter, a slight decrease of 2% year-over-year. Current subscription billings were $23.1 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, our 13th straight quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to focus our efforts on transitioning customers to our cloud solution and selling new cloud deployments to new and existing customers. In Q2, we enhanced our go-to-market capabilities through a partnership with Microsoft, which makes MicroStrategy available on the Azure Marketplace. This partnership allows existing customers to transition to our cloud solution on Azure and provides us with the opportunity to sell into new net accounts, which we believe have the potential to drive significant incremental subscription revenue in the future. We intend to continue to enhance our go-to-market capabilities through hyper-scaler partnerships in the coming year. In 2022, approximately two-thirds of our total revenue was recurring and we continue to focus and improve in this area as 70% of total revenue from the first half of 2023 was recurring in nature. The ongoing transition to a subscription model will help establish high-quality annual recurring revenues in to the future. Shifting to costs on Slide 17. Total non-GAAP expenses were $132 million in the second quarter compared to approximately $1 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The most notable difference overall year-over-year was the much lower bitcoin impairment charge this past quarter of $24 million in contrast to $918 million in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP cost of revenues was $26 million in the second quarter, an increase of $1.9 million or 8% year-over-year. However, as a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP cost of revenues were up approximately 2% year-over-year, primarily due to increasing cloud hosting costs consistent with prior quarters and in conjunction to the year-over-year increase in our cloud subscription services revenue. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased $1 million or 3% year-over-year to $33 million. As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP sales and marketing costs were higher by 1% year-over-year. Sales and marketing costs continued to normalize compared to the last few years due to higher demand for in-person customer meetings and events, such as our successful MicroStrategy World event in Q2. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were $27 million, a decrease of $1.5 million or 5% year-over-year, which reflects continuing cost efficiencies from our global tech delivery centers. Non-GAAP G&A costs were $21 million, a decrease of $1 million or 4% year-over-year or a slight decrease of 1% as a percentage of revenue. Our cost focus is on growing our cloud business, prioritizing revenue-generating and customer-facing activities and optimizing tech R&D globally, while prioritizing strategic innovation in our platform and we remain disciplined in overall cost controls, including closely managing our headcount and salary costs to minimize our controllable expenses. Turning to Slide 18, we reported a total non-GAAP operating loss in the second quarter of 2023 of $11 million, of which, the loss on the digital asset impairment charge, as mentioned a moment ago, was $24 million for the quarter. The digital asset impairment charge continues to be the primary driver impacting the comparison of our operating results year-over-year, and it's worth noting that in the first two quarters of 2023, the bitcoin impairment charges have been some of the lowest charges since launching our strategy in Q3 of 2020, which we believe reflects the continuing maturity of the overall bitcoin asset class. Part of the volatility in our reported earnings has been due to current GAAP accounting as you know, which treats our bitcoin holdings as indefinite intangible assets, which in turn results in recognizing impairments each quarter if there is any decrease in the fair value below our carrying value at any point during the quarter. At the end of 2022, the FASB unanimously voted to recommend a change to the adoption of fair value accounting for measuring certain digital assets including bitcoin. If finalized and we are able to recognize both decreases and increases in the fair value of bitcoin, we believe our reported earnings will be far more transparent to investors and far more relevant in reflecting changes in market prices. This past May, MicroStrategy submitted our response letter to the FASB on the proposed change, so we noted there was an overwhelming response from interested parties, which included support from sophisticated institutional asset managers, large accounting and audit firms, crypto exchanges and banks. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin in the world, MicroStrategy remains fully supportive of the proposed rules and the improved investor transparency we hope it brings. On Slide 19, as of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2.3 billion compared to approximately $4.6 billion in market value based on the bitcoin price at the end of Q2. The $2.3 billion difference between the carrying value and the fair market value of our total bitcoin would be recognized under a fair value model. And as of market close on Friday, July 28th, the market value of our 152,800 bitcoins was approximately $4.5 billion. Now turning to Slide 20. In Q2, we continued to execute on our at-the-market or ATM equity offering and raised $335 million in gross proceeds through the sale of Class-A common stock. We issued an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million shares at an average gross price per share of approximately $310. We have since terminated the prior $625 million ATM, of which approximately $290 million of the capacity remained. And today, we announced a new $750 million at-the-market program, establishing a net incremental issuance capacity of $460 million. As with prior programs, we may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of bitcoin as well as the repurchase or repayment of our outstanding debt. MicroStrategy stock outperformed the bitcoin in Q2 reflecting a high demand for institutional bitcoin exposure, especially following the additional positive momentum from increasing institutional interest and potentially new bitcoin ATS and exchanges. The incremental ATM capacity will allow us to benefit from this increased demand and will allow us to opportunistically raise capital based on market conditions. Our outstanding debt and convertible notes remain unchanged at a total of $2.2 billion with a bundled weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.6%. This is compared to the blended weighted average interest rate of 2.1% at the end of 2022, which equates to a decrease of over $15 million in annualized interest expense, strengthening our overall liquidity position. And at the end of the second quarter, we held $66 million in cash on our balance sheet which is more than enough overall liquidity to manage our ongoing working capital needs and the debt service obligations. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have raised a total of $1.7 billion in gross proceeds through our ATM programs with the average price of all issuances of approximately $424 per share. The primary use of prior ATM proceeds has been to acquire additional bitcoin, increasing bitcoin per share for our shareholders. In Q1 2023, we also used ATM proceeds to deleverage our balance sheet by repaying our bitcoin-backed secured term loan at an attractive discount. On Slide 22. In Q2, we increased our net Bitcoin position by 12,333 bitcoin using net proceeds from ATM issuances as well as excess cash from operations. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired an additional 467 bitcoins or $14.4 million, again using excess cash from our operations. And as of July 31st, we now hold a total of 152,800 bitcoins on our balance sheet, of which 15,731 bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy, the parent, and are pledged as collateral securing our 2028 secured notes. The remaining 137,069 Bitcoins are held at the macro strategy subsidiary, all of which are fully unpledged and unencumbered, representing 90% of our total bitcoin holdings or $4 billion in current market value. Despite the recent macro headwinds, we continue to remain optimistic for the remainder of the year. We anticipate total revenue this year similar to last year. We will continue to focus on innovation in cloud and artificial intelligence as we innovate our products and increase demand from our customers. We expect to grow cloud subscription revenue and strengthen recurring revenue continuing to transform our platform to the cloud. We will remain disciplined and continue to manage costs and headcount effectively and we will continue to execute on our dual strategy of growing our BI software business and acquiring and holding bitcoin. With that, thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Thank you.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Andrew. I'd like to take this time to review our corporate strategy with regard to bitcoin and then talk about our going forward strategy. So first, I thought it would be appropriate to do a review of the results of our strategy since August 10, 2020. We're nine days away from the three-year anniversary of us embarking on a bitcoin strategy. And I think it's very significant because August was the doldrums of the summer in 2020 when we were just a few months post-COVID and the entire world was thinking about how to react to these unprecedented times. We started out with a thought how does one preserve wealth in the face of what is likely to be monetary inflation? And as you all recall, interest rates were 0% there, lots of stocks had adjusted, lots of assets were moving around. If we look at the chart in front of us, what you'll see is, the S&P 500 appreciated 37% since then. So, call it, on average about 12% a year for the three years and Nasdaq underperformed the S&P, but 37% is really the hurdle rate for wealth preservation. If you underperform 37%, then presumably you're destroying shareholder value and you're destroying wealth, and if you can outperform the 37%, you're creating wealth. So as we look at these various asset classes, we can see that bitcoin is the winner of the asset class, almost 4 times what the S&P 500 did. So bitcoin performed 100 -- returned 145% in that three-year timeframe. So that's a pretty stunning performance really, in fact, bitcoin's performance outdoes every other asset class and every big tech stock and every enterprise software stock. And so, of course, bitcoin is the most thermodynamically sound asset and our thesis has always been that bitcoin is perfected gold and has all of the attributes of gold, but none of the liabilities of gold, but bitcoin is also a dominant big tech network with all of the attributes or assets of a big tech company, but none of the liabilities of a big tech company. And you can see on the chart, bitcoin is performing like that. Gold is down 3% in those three years. So of all the money that was created -- and you could make the argument that the monetary supply worldwide or at least in the Western world expanded by 37% over that time period. If so, the S&P captured its pro rata fair share of that monetary inflation then Nasdaq fell a bit behind, but gold didn't capture any of it, gold is down 3% and we had a decision to make as company should we actually convert $250 million worth of our cash into gold or $250 million of our cash into bitcoin. And of course, for those of you who have followed us on this entire journey and you play it out, what you can see is that, if we had actually chosen the path of gold, we would have less than $250 million in tangible assets in our treasury right now, and it seems very, very unlikely we would have been able to raise any more capital or develop any shareholder consensus or investor consensus to continue with the strategy. So gold is not bitcoin. Bitcoin is digital gold, but as you can see the difference between the digital thing and the analog thing is plus 145% versus minus 3%. Silver has underperformed gold because silver is less scarce than gold, more of a manufacturable commodity. And bonds have been the worst investment in this asset class, and of course, there's a simple reason why, right? Interest rates were zero and the thinking was they would stay very, very low for a long time and long-term interest rates were very low. And of course, as the interest rates increased over the last three years that undermined the performance of bond portfolios. We all know the story from the insolvent banks that have been under pressure earlier this year. So key assets and indexes tell a story and the story is bitcoin is the winning strategy, S&P is status quo, S&P has a strategy to not lose. Every other strategy with assets is a losing strategy. We see the big tech companies, you would have been better off to invest it in a very tight portfolio, a big tech stocks like Google, Apple and Microsoft than invest in the S&P, that's because they are digital, global monopolies and they're just as powerful today as they were three years ago and they just keep getting more powerful. But it's not always risk free to be in big tech as the results of Meta and Netflix and Amazon indicate that you can underperform the S&P because they're companies. The big winner in the enterprise software space is Oracle, and Oracle is very -- is the primary enterprise software company, always has been the most powerful and dominant one. As you can see IBM, Salesforce.com and SAP have all suffered or underperformed the S&P. So against all of those is the comps, as a business intelligence company, we're an enterprise software company so we compare ourselves to enterprise software stocks, and of course, the best companies in the world, the big tech companies, so we compare ourselves to the big tech stocks. And the question is, how does the mid-sized enterprise software company manage to outperform them all? And the idea was bitcoin, but as you can see and I'm delighted to announce MicroStrategy's not only outperformed all assets, all big tech and all enterprise software stocks, MicroStrategy over that three years has actually outperformed bitcoin itself. Now, that's despite the fact that on August 10th we bought $250 million worth of bitcoin and bitcoin was a small or a fraction of our enterprise value, 20%, 25% probably a 20% of enterprise value is bitcoin at that time. And somehow we've managed to get more than 100% performance. The way we do that is via intelligent active management of our balance sheet by taking on intelligent leverage. And so the conclusion here is, the bitcoin strategy is working, there really isn't any strategy conceivable that could have worked better for us. And of course on a risk-adjusted basis, given all the possible other strategies and the risk they would imply, then bitcoin actually appears to be the least risky strategy to outperform the S&P. There are certain number of characteristics of MicroStrategy that have allowed us to outperform bitcoin and I'd like to delve into those a little bit more in the next slide. The question that pops up a lot is, well if MicroStrategy is going to own bitcoin or so much of it, then why don't I just buy bitcoin, why do I need to buy MicroStrategy? And so that's the first question to ask yourself and I could give an analogy, the analogy is, compare buying a house in the best neighborhood that you can find, that you can purchase today with no money down, have all the cash advance to you by the bank and then you can rent it out as an investment property for investment income versus buying the identical house that might be priced 20% cheaper, but it's located in a scary neighborhood, it's going to take more than a year to purchase and it's going to have to be paid for in cash, you can't finance it. And if you think about those two propositions, you can see the houses are identical, but a 20% discount doesn't adjust for all of the other headaches in acquiring the house and given a choice between the two, 98% or some overwhelming number of homebuyers would buy the house that's easy to buy, that they can finance at the bank. So, MicroStrategy is a security. And so, when I say a good neighborhood what we mean is, you can buy it on -- buy it from your broker, your big bulge bracket bank, maybe it's a Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs. So, an investor can work through the banking relationship they've had for 20 years. And the second thing is, the bank will allow them to finance it so they can buy it for no money down, they can't buy it in a matter of minutes. And with bitcoin, you would have to establish a whole new set of relationships, new custodian relationships, new processes for custody, you have to find a new exchange, it's a little bit of a scary process and it takes a lot of work, it'll take you a year and you have to pay for it all in cash upfront because you can't finance the purchase. So when we talk about ease of access, MicroStrategy versus Bitcoin, you can see that for an investor that just wanted to make an investment quickly, one of them is a quick compliant process that takes a minute with no cash or just very, very convenient routine, all their compliance procedures are the same, all of their compensation structure is the same, their accounting is the same, their charter allows it, it's very easy, whereas buying the bitcoin means you have to rethink all those things and it's going to take a long time and it's going to be difficult. So the second element of this situation is stability downside protection, bitcoin is simply linear up and down, but MicroStrategy has a non Bitcoin business, the Business Intelligence business. So it's an enterprise software company and that means the revenues of the software company and the cash flows of the enterprise software company and the ability to sell equity or to finance things via equity and debt financing against the enterprise software company, they are not correlated to bitcoin. So you've got an uncorrelated business to provide some stability and downside protection if you're an investor. I mean, the third element is, can you actually take on intelligent leverage? With bitcoin, of course, it's just one-to-one, you invest $1 million, you get a $1 million of bitcoin. But with MicroStrategy, we're actually carrying leverage, we have $2.2 billion of leverage against $4.6 billion of bitcoin assets, so call it a loan-to-value that's approaching 50%, but -- of the underlying assets, but the difference is intelligent leverage would be defined as I pay a very low interest rate 1.6%, whereas the federal funds rate is 5% right now and long-term interest rates for junk bonds could be 8%. So 1.6% is good interest rate, the mortgage rate on a 30-year mortgage is something like 7%, so we like low interest. The second element of intelligent leverage is no mark-to-market or margins called potential. You could say that we had to Silvergate loan, we decided it wasn't optimal to keep it so we repaid it and retired it because we didn't want to have that mark-to-market question. And so, all of the debt that we have, the senior secured debt or the convertible debt, it's and assets not marked to market and we don't have to worry about margin call, right, and with regard to the converts, it's junior and unsecured debt. So that's the second really nice element to intelligent leverage. And so, there really isn't any easy way to go and get unsecured low-interest non-mark-to-market debt against bitcoin. It used to be -- you could get mark-to-market expensive margin loans against bitcoin, but the great majority of all the companies that offered mark-to-market margin loans against bitcoin have all gone out of business or been bankrupted. So right now MicroStrategy is fairly unique and the ability that we can very efficiently and safely borrow against this asset and then use that financing in order to buy more bitcoin. I think any consumer, if they had $100,000 a bitcoin and someone said, would you like to be able to borrow $50,000 against it and pay 1% interest with no margin call and have it come due in five years. They would say, well, yes, sign me up, how do I get that loan, right? And so, MicroStrategy offers people the ability to get that kind of intelligent leverage on a bitcoin strategy that you can't get just by buying the bitcoin. You can see in my next column on Generate Yield, MicroStrategy actively manages its business, we're an operating company and so we generate cash flow just like we were able to take $14.4 million of organic cash flow in July and use it to buy bitcoin. Our objective is to find ways to generate incremental bitcoin for our shareholders and do that with either cash flow from the business or do it through intelligent accretive financings of equity or debt or other intelligent operations, and of course, if you just buy the bitcoin you can't generate yield. If we go to risk management, the thing about risk management is MicroStrategy has two different convertible bonds and a senior secured bond, and those are different ways that you can actually get bitcoin exposure without actually having direct linear upside, downside, and so there are risk management options. And then, of course, MicroStrategy has a set of options that trade against our stock puts and calls in a pretty deep option tree and a lot of open interest in those options. And for the most part, people that own the bitcoin itself, they don't have those risk management options to trade in the derivatives, it's tricky to find that and you certainly can't find it easily in the United States. It is true there are some bitcoin derivatives on the CME, but the market is not nearly so well-developed as the market in stock options for well understood NASDAQ traded software companies. And so that's another advantage to our investors. And of course, the last thing you want is you want for performance to track the price and of course, yes, bitcoin obviously track the price of bitcoin and MicroStrategy has been able to outperform the price of bitcoin, but generally at least perform at that level or better. Now, the question that people next to ask us is, well, how does MicroStrategy compare to bitcoin ETF? And so you've got to start with the futures ETF, while the futures ETF is available or they are available right now, but as you can see, they don't have an uncorrelated operating business attached to them for downside protection. They can't use intelligent leverage, they can't issue junk bonds or they can't issue convertible bonds in order to lever up intelligently and cheaply without a mark-to-market risk. They don't generate yield and, in fact, they charge a fee and so MicroStrategy doesn't charge a fee to our investors to manage the $4.6 billion of bitcoin, but at a 100 basis point fee $4.6 billion generates $46 million a year of cost. And so the fees can be expensive and our goal is don't charge the fee, generate the yield. And then, of course, if you go to risk management, there are some options that you can trade on the futures ETF, but you don't have nearly the depth of the derivatives market or open interest and you don't have all the converts. So they don't quite have that kind of risk management opportunity. And then in terms of the performance, the challenge and the open secret in this industry right now is futures ETFs aren't tracking bitcoin, in fact, they're underperforming bitcoin performance this year, I think 30% year-to-date, right. So the futures ETFs have underperformed the bitcoin index 30% year-to-date, bitcoin is up 76%, as I'm speaking to you right now and these futures were up 44%. So, that's a challenge if you're an institutional investor. No one's going to want underperform the index by 10% or 15%. The spot ETF is clearly in demand, right, and you can see that -- you can see why you would want to spot ETF, but they're not available yet. If they do become available, then presumably, they'll be able to track performance much better and they'll still have the other challenges of downside protection intelligent leverage and they won't generate yield or charge a fee. And they are on the horizon, but as you can see, the spot ETFs when they come along, they won't offer the same kind of leverage yield that MicroStrategy offers or the other options that are listening to institutional investors. Gray scale is very famous, but it's an over the counter only instrument and fairly unique. And of course, they're not an operating company so they can't actively manage the business to generate yield and they don't have a healthy open interest and derivatives and they can't take on leverage. And that just leaves you bitcoin miners. Bitcoin miners give your exposure, they're just extremely highly levered exposure on the upside and the downside because their revenues on the upside and their cost, all are very, very volatile and very highly levered. So they are a way for institutions to get involved in the business but they don't have the same mixture of options that MicroStrategy has because we're an operating company. And so, you can see when you look at this chart, how it's possible for MicroStrategy to outperform bitcoin, but I think you can also see by looking at this chart that MicroStrategy's unique investment option for any institutional investor that wants bitcoin exposure that's different than a spot Bitcoin ETF, and so, we expect that we will be a differentiated investment option for bitcoin going forward when or if the spot ETFs are approved. And I think generally, if we look at the outlook for bitcoin, it's never been better, the environment is providing clarity that bitcoin is a global asset that's in demand from institutions all around the world and it's fully decentralized. And so, I think that the next 12 months will bring a good set of milestones for bitcoin adoption, and one of them would be the spot ETF approvals. If those are approved, I think generally, that will be good for the entire asset class and bitcoiners will benefit. There are a whole class of institutional investors that will need our spot ETF to get involved with bitcoin and MicroStrategy wouldn't be the right option for them because they really just need to be able to buy an unlimited amount of bitcoin without worrying about not tracking the bitcoin price and with clarity and transparency. So I think that will expand the pie, I think all of these options generally expand the pie, and MicroStrategy is going to continue to be thoughtful and responsible about managing our business in order to find ways to get incremental bitcoin for our investors. And so, thank you for your support. I guess, I'll pass the floor back to Shirish for questions now.\nOperator:\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Great. Thank you, Michael. We're going to jump right into questions and the first question is for Michael. Bow would a spot ETF impact your strategy of serving as a vehicle to gain exposure to bitcoin? And how would an approval or rejection of a spot ETF impact MicroStrategy?\nMichael Saylor: I think the big milestones for institutional adoption of bitcoin over the next year will be: one, fair value accounting; two, the spot ETF; three, the having; four, any particular regulatory rules that come out of Washington DC. So we're waiting for all of those. The spot ETF isn't -- approval isn't necessary for us to continue to be successful. I think in general, there is a class of investors like, let's say, a sovereign wealth fund. If they want to buy $1 billion of bitcoin in a week or billions of dollars of bitcoin and win 10 or 100 of them all want to do it, they're going to need the spot ETFs because MicroStrategy doesn't have the room in our capital structure for someone to buy that much of our stock. So, I think that the spot ETFs will expand the entire asset class dramatically, it will be -- it will create a very convenient path for mass adoption of retail and mass adoption of institutional investors and mass adoption of sovereign wealth and the like. It solves the -- I think Larry Fink made the point on CNBC, he said, it will drive the fees down by a factor of 10 to 100 like the trade -- the acquisition fees. It solves the problem of, do I need to start a new account with the crypto exchange or can I just call up my existing banker -- banking relationship my existing wealth manager or existing broker. So it's going to smooth access to many, many types of investors. It's going to democratize access, it's going to allow size that now, currently the market doesn't allow this kind of size, because the futures ETFs and the futures market is not an effective vehicle, it's not deep enough and broad enough to allow someone to take on many, many billions of dollars of exposure without paying a 10% or 20% annualized fee or more and no rational investor is going to do that for any material amount of time. So I think, it will be good. I do believe at some point, we'll have spot ETFs. I just can't tell you when they will arrive. And when they do arrive, MicroStrategy will still be differentiated as a particular bitcoin operating strategy. But the spot ETFs will serve another set of customers in a synergistic fashion to grow the entire asset class.\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Mike. So we might be having some technical difficulties from Shirish. So I'll maybe ask the next question for Phong. Phong, how should we be thinking about the AI partnership with Microsoft and its monetization? Are you expecting any kind of incremental boost from that in 2023 or is it more of a 2024 growth driver.\nPhong Le: Thanks, Andrew. First, I'm pretty excited about our AI capabilities that we're bringing to market in Q3, so in September. And part of the capabilities will include a new product or a new skew, if you will, that will sell separately from our existing BI platform and sort of on-top of that. So I do anticipate some incremental revenue, whether it comes in Q4, whether it comes in 2024, I think time will tell as to how quickly the market is willing to adopt and pay for AI capabilities. I do think there's a couple of things that we're doing that's pretty unique from the rest of the BI market, if you will. One is, we're directly embedding open AI into the MicroStrategy Platform, which means you do not need to go and have a separate Microsoft agreement or separate open AI agreement, it will be fully embedded in the MicroStrategy Platform. And second, as you mentioned, we're going to [indiscernible] and partnering in directly with Microsoft, which there are lot of companies who are trying to build their own AI capabilities or use a different platform that's inferior at this point in time to open AI. So I think what we're going to rollout is quite differentiated. And I'm excited about the revenue opportunity that will bring.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks Phong. Next question is for Andrew. We are projecting the company to improve its cash position in 2023 and beyond. Bearing in mind the company's strategy to purchase bitcoins with excess cash above working capital needs, is there a minimum cash balance that the company targets and what is a reasonable number to anchor to?\nAndrew Kang: I'd say just to comment on kind of our treasury reserve policy or how we think about cash. Our goal is to always be as efficient as possible with our cash and then really minimize any excess cash in the business. This since we operate globally we ensure we maintain adequate cash in each region and country. We operate in and we manage cash and in the U.S., primarily to take into account, meaning, working capital needs, as well as our debt interest payments needs as well. I'd say, probably anywhere between $40 million based on the calendar to maybe as high as $50 million probably is a little bit high, but I think about those ranges being kind of where we think working capital needs are. That being said, sometimes you will see cash balances that are slightly higher as we build towards working capital needs and sometimes you will see them lower when we're operating efficiently as possible. So, hopefully that answers the question.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. So thanks everyone for your questions. We received a lot of good questions. But [indiscernible] the top of our time for today. So we will be available offline for any other questions, but this concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar and I will now turn the call over to Phong for final closing remarks.\nPhong Le: Thanks. Shirish, and. I want to thank everyone for being with us today and we appreciate your support. We're as enthusiastic as ever with both of our strategies, our enterprise software strategy and our bitcoin strategy and we wish everyone a good quarter and good rest of your summer and look-forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks. Thank you.",

            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. I'd like to take this time to review our corporate strategy with regard to bitcoin and then talk about our going forward strategy. So first, I thought it would be appropriate to do a review of the results of our strategy since August 10, 2020. We're nine days away from the three-year anniversary of us embarking on a bitcoin strategy. And I think it's very significant because August was the doldrums of the summer in 2020 when we were just a few months post-COVID and the entire world was thinking about how to react to these unprecedented times. We started out with a thought how does one preserve wealth in the face of what is likely to be monetary inflation? And as you all recall, interest rates were 0% there, lots of stocks had adjusted, lots of assets were moving around. If we look at the chart in front of us, what you'll see is, the S&P 500 appreciated 37% since then. So, call it, on average about 12% a year for the three years and Nasdaq underperformed the S&P, but 37% is really the hurdle rate for wealth preservation. If you underperform 37%, then presumably you're destroying shareholder value and you're destroying wealth, and if you can outperform the 37%, you're creating wealth. So as we look at these various asset classes, we can see that bitcoin is the winner of the asset class, almost 4 times what the S&P 500 did. So bitcoin performed 100 -- returned 145% in that three-year timeframe. So that's a pretty stunning performance really, in fact, bitcoin's performance outdoes every other asset class and every big tech stock and every enterprise software stock. And so, of course, bitcoin is the most thermodynamically sound asset and our thesis has always been that bitcoin is perfected gold and has all of the attributes of gold, but none of the liabilities of gold, but bitcoin is also a dominant big tech network with all of the attributes or assets of a big tech company, but none of the liabilities of a big tech company. And you can see on the chart, bitcoin is performing like that. Gold is down 3% in those three years. So of all the money that was created -- and you could make the argument that the monetary supply worldwide or at least in the Western world expanded by 37% over that time period. If so, the S&P captured its pro rata fair share of that monetary inflation then Nasdaq fell a bit behind, but gold didn't capture any of it, gold is down 3% and we had a decision to make as company should we actually convert $250 million worth of our cash into gold or $250 million of our cash into bitcoin. And of course, for those of you who have followed us on this entire journey and you play it out, what you can see is that, if we had actually chosen the path of gold, we would have less than $250 million in tangible assets in our treasury right now, and it seems very, very unlikely we would have been able to raise any more capital or develop any shareholder consensus or investor consensus to continue with the strategy. So gold is not bitcoin. Bitcoin is digital gold, but as you can see the difference between the digital thing and the analog thing is plus 145% versus minus 3%. Silver has underperformed gold because silver is less scarce than gold, more of a manufacturable commodity. And bonds have been the worst investment in this asset class, and of course, there's a simple reason why, right? Interest rates were zero and the thinking was they would stay very, very low for a long time and long-term interest rates were very low. And of course, as the interest rates increased over the last three years that undermined the performance of bond portfolios. We all know the story from the insolvent banks that have been under pressure earlier this year. So key assets and indexes tell a story and the story is bitcoin is the winning strategy, S&P is status quo, S&P has a strategy to not lose. Every other strategy with assets is a losing strategy. We see the big tech companies, you would have been better off to invest it in a very tight portfolio, a big tech stocks like Google, Apple and Microsoft than invest in the S&P, that's because they are digital, global monopolies and they're just as powerful today as they were three years ago and they just keep getting more powerful. But it's not always risk free to be in big tech as the results of Meta and Netflix and Amazon indicate that you can underperform the S&P because they're companies. The big winner in the enterprise software space is Oracle, and Oracle is very -- is the primary enterprise software company, always has been the most powerful and dominant one. As you can see IBM, Salesforce.com and SAP have all suffered or underperformed the S&P. So against all of those is the comps, as a business intelligence company, we're an enterprise software company so we compare ourselves to enterprise software stocks, and of course, the best companies in the world, the big tech companies, so we compare ourselves to the big tech stocks. And the question is, how does the mid-sized enterprise software company manage to outperform them all? And the idea was bitcoin, but as you can see and I'm delighted to announce MicroStrategy's not only outperformed all assets, all big tech and all enterprise software stocks, MicroStrategy over that three years has actually outperformed bitcoin itself. Now, that's despite the fact that on August 10th we bought $250 million worth of bitcoin and bitcoin was a small or a fraction of our enterprise value, 20%, 25% probably a 20% of enterprise value is bitcoin at that time. And somehow we've managed to get more than 100% performance. The way we do that is via intelligent active management of our balance sheet by taking on intelligent leverage. And so the conclusion here is, the bitcoin strategy is working, there really isn't any strategy conceivable that could have worked better for us. And of course on a risk-adjusted basis, given all the possible other strategies and the risk they would imply, then bitcoin actually appears to be the least risky strategy to outperform the S&P. There are certain number of characteristics of MicroStrategy that have allowed us to outperform bitcoin and I'd like to delve into those a little bit more in the next slide. The question that pops up a lot is, well if MicroStrategy is going to own bitcoin or so much of it, then why don't I just buy bitcoin, why do I need to buy MicroStrategy? And so that's the first question to ask yourself and I could give an analogy, the analogy is, compare buying a house in the best neighborhood that you can find, that you can purchase today with no money down, have all the cash advance to you by the bank and then you can rent it out as an investment property for investment income versus buying the identical house that might be priced 20% cheaper, but it's located in a scary neighborhood, it's going to take more than a year to purchase and it's going to have to be paid for in cash, you can't finance it. And if you think about those two propositions, you can see the houses are identical, but a 20% discount doesn't adjust for all of the other headaches in acquiring the house and given a choice between the two, 98% or some overwhelming number of homebuyers would buy the house that's easy to buy, that they can finance at the bank. So, MicroStrategy is a security. And so, when I say a good neighborhood what we mean is, you can buy it on -- buy it from your broker, your big bulge bracket bank, maybe it's a Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs. So, an investor can work through the banking relationship they've had for 20 years. And the second thing is, the bank will allow them to finance it so they can buy it for no money down, they can't buy it in a matter of minutes. And with bitcoin, you would have to establish a whole new set of relationships, new custodian relationships, new processes for custody, you have to find a new exchange, it's a little bit of a scary process and it takes a lot of work, it'll take you a year and you have to pay for it all in cash upfront because you can't finance the purchase. So when we talk about ease of access, MicroStrategy versus Bitcoin, you can see that for an investor that just wanted to make an investment quickly, one of them is a quick compliant process that takes a minute with no cash or just very, very convenient routine, all their compliance procedures are the same, all of their compensation structure is the same, their accounting is the same, their charter allows it, it's very easy, whereas buying the bitcoin means you have to rethink all those things and it's going to take a long time and it's going to be difficult. So the second element of this situation is stability downside protection, bitcoin is simply linear up and down, but MicroStrategy has a non Bitcoin business, the Business Intelligence business. So it's an enterprise software company and that means the revenues of the software company and the cash flows of the enterprise software company and the ability to sell equity or to finance things via equity and debt financing against the enterprise software company, they are not correlated to bitcoin. So you've got an uncorrelated business to provide some stability and downside protection if you're an investor. I mean, the third element is, can you actually take on intelligent leverage? With bitcoin, of course, it's just one-to-one, you invest $1 million, you get a $1 million of bitcoin. But with MicroStrategy, we're actually carrying leverage, we have $2.2 billion of leverage against $4.6 billion of bitcoin assets, so call it a loan-to-value that's approaching 50%, but -- of the underlying assets, but the difference is intelligent leverage would be defined as I pay a very low interest rate 1.6%, whereas the federal funds rate is 5% right now and long-term interest rates for junk bonds could be 8%. So 1.6% is good interest rate, the mortgage rate on a 30-year mortgage is something like 7%, so we like low interest. The second element of intelligent leverage is no mark-to-market or margins called potential. You could say that we had to Silvergate loan, we decided it wasn't optimal to keep it so we repaid it and retired it because we didn't want to have that mark-to-market question. And so, all of the debt that we have, the senior secured debt or the convertible debt, it's and assets not marked to market and we don't have to worry about margin call, right, and with regard to the converts, it's junior and unsecured debt. So that's the second really nice element to intelligent leverage. And so, there really isn't any easy way to go and get unsecured low-interest non-mark-to-market debt against bitcoin. It used to be -- you could get mark-to-market expensive margin loans against bitcoin, but the great majority of all the companies that offered mark-to-market margin loans against bitcoin have all gone out of business or been bankrupted. So right now MicroStrategy is fairly unique and the ability that we can very efficiently and safely borrow against this asset and then use that financing in order to buy more bitcoin. I think any consumer, if they had $100,000 a bitcoin and someone said, would you like to be able to borrow $50,000 against it and pay 1% interest with no margin call and have it come due in five years. They would say, well, yes, sign me up, how do I get that loan, right? And so, MicroStrategy offers people the ability to get that kind of intelligent leverage on a bitcoin strategy that you can't get just by buying the bitcoin. You can see in my next column on Generate Yield, MicroStrategy actively manages its business, we're an operating company and so we generate cash flow just like we were able to take $14.4 million of organic cash flow in July and use it to buy bitcoin. Our objective is to find ways to generate incremental bitcoin for our shareholders and do that with either cash flow from the business or do it through intelligent accretive financings of equity or debt or other intelligent operations, and of course, if you just buy the bitcoin you can't generate yield. If we go to risk management, the thing about risk management is MicroStrategy has two different convertible bonds and a senior secured bond, and those are different ways that you can actually get bitcoin exposure without actually having direct linear upside, downside, and so there are risk management options. And then, of course, MicroStrategy has a set of options that trade against our stock puts and calls in a pretty deep option tree and a lot of open interest in those options. And for the most part, people that own the bitcoin itself, they don't have those risk management options to trade in the derivatives, it's tricky to find that and you certainly can't find it easily in the United States. It is true there are some bitcoin derivatives on the CME, but the market is not nearly so well-developed as the market in stock options for well understood NASDAQ traded software companies. And so that's another advantage to our investors. And of course, the last thing you want is you want for performance to track the price and of course, yes, bitcoin obviously track the price of bitcoin and MicroStrategy has been able to outperform the price of bitcoin, but generally at least perform at that level or better. Now, the question that people next to ask us is, well, how does MicroStrategy compare to bitcoin ETF? And so you've got to start with the futures ETF, while the futures ETF is available or they are available right now, but as you can see, they don't have an uncorrelated operating business attached to them for downside protection. They can't use intelligent leverage, they can't issue junk bonds or they can't issue convertible bonds in order to lever up intelligently and cheaply without a mark-to-market risk. They don't generate yield and, in fact, they charge a fee and so MicroStrategy doesn't charge a fee to our investors to manage the $4.6 billion of bitcoin, but at a 100 basis point fee $4.6 billion generates $46 million a year of cost. And so the fees can be expensive and our goal is don't charge the fee, generate the yield. And then, of course, if you go to risk management, there are some options that you can trade on the futures ETF, but you don't have nearly the depth of the derivatives market or open interest and you don't have all the converts. So they don't quite have that kind of risk management opportunity. And then in terms of the performance, the challenge and the open secret in this industry right now is futures ETFs aren't tracking bitcoin, in fact, they're underperforming bitcoin performance this year, I think 30% year-to-date, right. So the futures ETFs have underperformed the bitcoin index 30% year-to-date, bitcoin is up 76%, as I'm speaking to you right now and these futures were up 44%. So, that's a challenge if you're an institutional investor. No one's going to want underperform the index by 10% or 15%. The spot ETF is clearly in demand, right, and you can see that -- you can see why you would want to spot ETF, but they're not available yet. If they do become available, then presumably, they'll be able to track performance much better and they'll still have the other challenges of downside protection intelligent leverage and they won't generate yield or charge a fee. And they are on the horizon, but as you can see, the spot ETFs when they come along, they won't offer the same kind of leverage yield that MicroStrategy offers or the other options that are listening to institutional investors. Gray scale is very famous, but it's an over the counter only instrument and fairly unique. And of course, they're not an operating company so they can't actively manage the business to generate yield and they don't have a healthy open interest and derivatives and they can't take on leverage. And that just leaves you bitcoin miners. Bitcoin miners give your exposure, they're just extremely highly levered exposure on the upside and the downside because their revenues on the upside and their cost, all are very, very volatile and very highly levered. So they are a way for institutions to get involved in the business but they don't have the same mixture of options that MicroStrategy has because we're an operating company. And so, you can see when you look at this chart, how it's possible for MicroStrategy to outperform bitcoin, but I think you can also see by looking at this chart that MicroStrategy's unique investment option for any institutional investor that wants bitcoin exposure that's different than a spot Bitcoin ETF, and so, we expect that we will be a differentiated investment option for bitcoin going forward when or if the spot ETFs are approved. And I think generally, if we look at the outlook for bitcoin, it's never been better, the environment is providing clarity that bitcoin is a global asset that's in demand from institutions all around the world and it's fully decentralized. And so, I think that the next 12 months will bring a good set of milestones for bitcoin adoption, and one of them would be the spot ETF approvals. If those are approved, I think generally, that will be good for the entire asset class and bitcoiners will benefit. There are a whole class of institutional investors that will need our spot ETF to get involved with bitcoin and MicroStrategy wouldn't be the right option for them because they really just need to be able to buy an unlimited amount of bitcoin without worrying about not tracking the bitcoin price and with clarity and transparency. So I think that will expand the pie, I think all of these options generally expand the pie, and MicroStrategy is going to continue to be thoughtful and responsible about managing our business in order to find ways to get incremental bitcoin for our investors. And so, thank you for your support. I guess, I'll pass the floor back to Shirish for questions now. I think the big milestones for institutional adoption of bitcoin over the next year will be: one, fair value accounting; two, the spot ETF; three, the having; four, any particular regulatory rules that come out of Washington DC. So we're waiting for all of those. The spot ETF isn't -- approval isn't necessary for us to continue to be successful. I think in general, there is a class of investors like, let's say, a sovereign wealth fund. If they want to buy $1 billion of bitcoin in a week or billions of dollars of bitcoin and win 10 or 100 of them all want to do it, they're going to need the spot ETFs because MicroStrategy doesn't have the room in our capital structure for someone to buy that much of our stock. So, I think that the spot ETFs will expand the entire asset class dramatically, it will be -- it will create a very convenient path for mass adoption of retail and mass adoption of institutional investors and mass adoption of sovereign wealth and the like. It solves the -- I think Larry Fink made the point on CNBC, he said, it will drive the fees down by a factor of 10 to 100 like the trade -- the acquisition fees. It solves the problem of, do I need to start a new account with the crypto exchange or can I just call up my existing banker -- banking relationship my existing wealth manager or existing broker. So it's going to smooth access to many, many types of investors. It's going to democratize access, it's going to allow size that now, currently the market doesn't allow this kind of size, because the futures ETFs and the futures market is not an effective vehicle, it's not deep enough and broad enough to allow someone to take on many, many billions of dollars of exposure without paying a 10% or 20% annualized fee or more and no rational investor is going to do that for any material amount of time. So I think, it will be good. I do believe at some point, we'll have spot ETFs. I just can't tell you when they will arrive. And when they do arrive, MicroStrategy will still be differentiated as a particular bitcoin operating strategy. But the spot ETFs will serve another set of customers in a synergistic fashion to grow the entire asset class."

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you, Phong. I'll start by recapping some of the key GAAP financial results for the quarter. GAAP total revenues for Q2 were $120.4 million, down $1.7 million or 1% year-over-year and flat year-over-year at constant currency. Total software license revenues, which consist of product license revenues and subscription services revenues were $35.4 million, up 4% year-over-year and up 7% at constant currency. Subscription service revenues which reflect recurring revenues from our cloud business were $19.9 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year or an increase of 44% at constant currency. Product license revenues were $15.5 million for the quarter, down 23% year-over-year or down 20% at constant currency. While we saw some ongoing headwinds from the overall challenging macroenvironment this past quarter, our results continue to reflect the expected decline in product license revenues as we transition our BI business to the cloud. We expect the mix of this revenue will continue to shift from product license to subscription services as we transition the platform over time. Product support revenues were $66.1 million, down 1% year-over-year and down 1% in constant currency. Customer renewal rates were 93% for the quarter and remained above 90% for the sixth consecutive quarter continuing to demonstrate the durability of our customer base even with a tough macroeconomic backdrop. Lastly, other services revenues were $18.9 million or 12% decrease year-over-year or 11% at constant currency, primarily due to lower consulting revenues. While we have seen higher average build rates worldwide, we did experience lower customer demand for consulting services in the quarter. However, we do expect consulting engagements to normalize in the second half of the year. On Slide 16, total current software license billings were $39.1 million in the second quarter, a slight decrease of 2% year-over-year. Current subscription billings were $23.1 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, our 13th straight quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to focus our efforts on transitioning customers to our cloud solution and selling new cloud deployments to new and existing customers. In Q2, we enhanced our go-to-market capabilities through a partnership with Microsoft, which makes MicroStrategy available on the Azure Marketplace. This partnership allows existing customers to transition to our cloud solution on Azure and provides us with the opportunity to sell into new net accounts, which we believe have the potential to drive significant incremental subscription revenue in the future. We intend to continue to enhance our go-to-market capabilities through hyper-scaler partnerships in the coming year. In 2022, approximately two-thirds of our total revenue was recurring and we continue to focus and improve in this area as 70% of total revenue from the first half of 2023 was recurring in nature. The ongoing transition to a subscription model will help establish high-quality annual recurring revenues in to the future. Shifting to costs on Slide 17. Total non-GAAP expenses were $132 million in the second quarter compared to approximately $1 billion in the second quarter of 2022. The most notable difference overall year-over-year was the much lower bitcoin impairment charge this past quarter of $24 million in contrast to $918 million in Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP cost of revenues was $26 million in the second quarter, an increase of $1.9 million or 8% year-over-year. However, as a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP cost of revenues were up approximately 2% year-over-year, primarily due to increasing cloud hosting costs consistent with prior quarters and in conjunction to the year-over-year increase in our cloud subscription services revenue. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased $1 million or 3% year-over-year to $33 million. As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP sales and marketing costs were higher by 1% year-over-year. Sales and marketing costs continued to normalize compared to the last few years due to higher demand for in-person customer meetings and events, such as our successful MicroStrategy World event in Q2. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were $27 million, a decrease of $1.5 million or 5% year-over-year, which reflects continuing cost efficiencies from our global tech delivery centers. Non-GAAP G&A costs were $21 million, a decrease of $1 million or 4% year-over-year or a slight decrease of 1% as a percentage of revenue. Our cost focus is on growing our cloud business, prioritizing revenue-generating and customer-facing activities and optimizing tech R&D globally, while prioritizing strategic innovation in our platform and we remain disciplined in overall cost controls, including closely managing our headcount and salary costs to minimize our controllable expenses. Turning to Slide 18, we reported a total non-GAAP operating loss in the second quarter of 2023 of $11 million, of which, the loss on the digital asset impairment charge, as mentioned a moment ago, was $24 million for the quarter. The digital asset impairment charge continues to be the primary driver impacting the comparison of our operating results year-over-year, and it's worth noting that in the first two quarters of 2023, the bitcoin impairment charges have been some of the lowest charges since launching our strategy in Q3 of 2020, which we believe reflects the continuing maturity of the overall bitcoin asset class. Part of the volatility in our reported earnings has been due to current GAAP accounting as you know, which treats our bitcoin holdings as indefinite intangible assets, which in turn results in recognizing impairments each quarter if there is any decrease in the fair value below our carrying value at any point during the quarter. At the end of 2022, the FASB unanimously voted to recommend a change to the adoption of fair value accounting for measuring certain digital assets including bitcoin. If finalized and we are able to recognize both decreases and increases in the fair value of bitcoin, we believe our reported earnings will be far more transparent to investors and far more relevant in reflecting changes in market prices. This past May, MicroStrategy submitted our response letter to the FASB on the proposed change, so we noted there was an overwhelming response from interested parties, which included support from sophisticated institutional asset managers, large accounting and audit firms, crypto exchanges and banks. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin in the world, MicroStrategy remains fully supportive of the proposed rules and the improved investor transparency we hope it brings. On Slide 19, as of June 30, 2023, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2.3 billion compared to approximately $4.6 billion in market value based on the bitcoin price at the end of Q2. The $2.3 billion difference between the carrying value and the fair market value of our total bitcoin would be recognized under a fair value model. And as of market close on Friday, July 28th, the market value of our 152,800 bitcoins was approximately $4.5 billion. Now turning to Slide 20. In Q2, we continued to execute on our at-the-market or ATM equity offering and raised $335 million in gross proceeds through the sale of Class-A common stock. We issued an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million shares at an average gross price per share of approximately $310. We have since terminated the prior $625 million ATM, of which approximately $290 million of the capacity remained. And today, we announced a new $750 million at-the-market program, establishing a net incremental issuance capacity of $460 million. As with prior programs, we may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of bitcoin as well as the repurchase or repayment of our outstanding debt. MicroStrategy stock outperformed the bitcoin in Q2 reflecting a high demand for institutional bitcoin exposure, especially following the additional positive momentum from increasing institutional interest and potentially new bitcoin ATS and exchanges. The incremental ATM capacity will allow us to benefit from this increased demand and will allow us to opportunistically raise capital based on market conditions. Our outstanding debt and convertible notes remain unchanged at a total of $2.2 billion with a bundled weighted average interest rate of approximately 1.6%. This is compared to the blended weighted average interest rate of 2.1% at the end of 2022, which equates to a decrease of over $15 million in annualized interest expense, strengthening our overall liquidity position. And at the end of the second quarter, we held $66 million in cash on our balance sheet which is more than enough overall liquidity to manage our ongoing working capital needs and the debt service obligations. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have raised a total of $1.7 billion in gross proceeds through our ATM programs with the average price of all issuances of approximately $424 per share. The primary use of prior ATM proceeds has been to acquire additional bitcoin, increasing bitcoin per share for our shareholders. In Q1 2023, we also used ATM proceeds to deleverage our balance sheet by repaying our bitcoin-backed secured term loan at an attractive discount. On Slide 22. In Q2, we increased our net Bitcoin position by 12,333 bitcoin using net proceeds from ATM issuances as well as excess cash from operations. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we acquired an additional 467 bitcoins or $14.4 million, again using excess cash from our operations. And as of July 31st, we now hold a total of 152,800 bitcoins on our balance sheet, of which 15,731 bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy, the parent, and are pledged as collateral securing our 2028 secured notes. The remaining 137,069 Bitcoins are held at the macro strategy subsidiary, all of which are fully unpledged and unencumbered, representing 90% of our total bitcoin holdings or $4 billion in current market value. Despite the recent macro headwinds, we continue to remain optimistic for the remainder of the year. We anticipate total revenue this year similar to last year. We will continue to focus on innovation in cloud and artificial intelligence as we innovate our products and increase demand from our customers. We expect to grow cloud subscription revenue and strengthen recurring revenue continuing to transform our platform to the cloud. We will remain disciplined and continue to manage costs and headcount effectively and we will continue to execute on our dual strategy of growing our BI software business and acquiring and holding bitcoin. With that, thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Thank you. Thanks, Mike. So we might be having some technical difficulties from Shirish. So I'll maybe ask the next question for Phong. Phong, how should we be thinking about the AI partnership with Microsoft and its monetization? Are you expecting any kind of incremental boost from that in 2023 or is it more of a 2024 growth driver. I'd say just to comment on kind of our treasury reserve policy or how we think about cash. Our goal is to always be as efficient as possible with our cash and then really minimize any excess cash in the business. This since we operate globally we ensure we maintain adequate cash in each region and country. We operate in and we manage cash and in the U.S., primarily to take into account, meaning, working capital needs, as well as our debt interest payments needs as well. I'd say, probably anywhere between $40 million based on the calendar to maybe as high as $50 million probably is a little bit high, but I think about those ranges being kind of where we think working capital needs are. That being said, sometimes you will see cash balances that are slightly higher as we build towards working capital needs and sometimes you will see them lower when we're operating efficiently as possible. So, hopefully that answers the question."

            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar, and I'll start with the highlights of our software business. Our total revenue results in the second quarter of 2023 were mixed with challenges in product license revenue, balanced by strength in our cloud business. Revenues were primarily impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment leading to longer and delayed sales cycles. Growth in our recurring revenue illustrates the durability of our enterprise-grade platform and continued traction in cloud. We also saw continued strong profitability as we thoughtfully manage our cost structure. Total revenue was $120.4 million, representing a decrease of 1% year-over-year or flat on a constant-currency basis. Total software license revenues, which consist of total product licenses and subscription services revenues were $35.4 million, representing an increase of 4% year-over-year or 7% on a constant-currency basis. Total software license revenue performance benefited from increased adoption of our cloud platform, which was partially offset by a decrease in product license revenues. Total subscription services revenue was $19.9 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year or 44% on a constant-currency basis. And our Q2 subscription billings growth was 15% year-over-year. Even though difficult macroeconomic conditions continue to persist and may continue to impact our revenue in the coming quarters, MicroStrategy continues to invest in and focus on innovation, and I'm excited to tell you more about our product developments. At our MicroStrategy World User Conference held in person in May 2023, we highlighted and introduced MicroStrategy1, our enterprise AI/BI platform. In our keynote address, we highlighted how some of the biggest brands in the world, including organizations like Hilton Hotels, Amica Insurance, and Sony Interactive Entertainment leverage the power and unified capabilities of MicroStrategy to transform how they operate and succeed amidst fierce competition. With an eye to the future, we unveiled our vision of Intelligence Everywhere in the age of artificial intelligence and what our engineering team is building today. We also announced the development of our Lightning Rewards product, an innovative approach to monetizing interactions, which leverages the Lightning Network, the bitcoin Layer 2 payment protocol. And we've heard from industry experts across the bitcoin and Lightning Network ecosystems about the practical application of the Lightning Network for business today and tomorrow. Our new MicroStrategy ONE platform is the most important product innovation in the history of our company because it represents a fundamental shift in our industry to harness the power of business intelligence and artificial intelligence together to upgrade the way organizations do business. Said plainly, AI and BI are better together, and MicroStrategy has unique advantages for developing an AI/BI platform. Let me explain. This next-generation product suite is built to unleash new levels of efficiency and creativity. Organizations are looking to consolidate vendors to save costs, simplify deployment and maximize impact. They are looking to deploy AI-enabled applications to drive efficiency, productivity and impact to their operations. MicroStrategy ONE offers a comprehensive solution of flexibility and scale to address all types of use cases. We're extremely proud of the work done to build MicroStrategy ONE and are excited for customers and prospects alike to experience how it changes the way they think about the feature of AI and BI. MicroStrategy is well-positions how our organizations build and deploy AI applications to users by leveraging the core capabilities of our leading BI platform. In our experience, 80% of the complexity in building AI applications and solutions is procuring, transforming, organizing, securing and maintaining data. The challenges with scale, governance and trust with AI are amplified by an order of magnitude compared to traditional BI, and security and access control is paramount. All these are very similar to large-scale massive analytics deployments, something we believe we do best. By leveraging an open cloud-native compostable architecture, access to structured and unstructured inputs in a semantic graph connected to advanced deep learning and large language models we believe we have a proven framework for success. With the launch of the MicroStrategy ONE platform, we are now able to increasingly focus on MicroStrategy's hallmark, product innovation. Our innovation is focused on native cloud, artificial Intelligence and the Lightning Network. Building on the launch of MicroStrategy ONE in May, we'll be sharing details online and in-person around the globe starting in September. MicroStrategy Cloud is the foundation of MicroStrategy ONE and a key area of our research and development investments. The flexibility and scalability and security required to embrace AI further underscore the importance we have seen in this area in the more traditional analytics space. The power of multi-cloud deployment and containerized microservices architecture, enterprise-grade security, proactive cloud management from experts, seamless migration and backups, and single-click updates and upgrades allow cloud customers to appreciate immediate benefits of our platform. The comprehensive set of tools on our platform and scalable data governance ensures customers benefit from the ability to make fast, accurate and informed decisions, while accelerating access to the technology of the feature. These needs necessitate a cloud-first cloud-native approach that will be transformative for customers, and as such, will be an area of continued focus for us. Talking further about our AI innovation, the Q3 upgrade to our AI/BI platform planned for release this September will bring advanced AI capabilities in a new dimension. MicroStrategy AI empowering organizations to rapidly deploy, secure, govern and trusted AI applications. We brought the same care and expertise around data definitions [indiscernible], multi-source data access and governance from the traditional BI world and our approach to AI. The MicroStrategy semantic graph combined with generative AI and deep learning will enable organizations to better understand their data and their relationships, resulting in more accurate predictions, better data quality, improved model training and output and faster actionable insights. MicroStrategy's AI innovation focuses on productivity to empower each type of user within an organization to become more intelligent. As an example, MicroStrategy data whisperer supports the business user, providing access to an AI-powered Chatbot, that surfaces answers and self-service insights that understand the why behind the data. Companies can make every consumer a data scientist by extending these experience through MicroStrategy Insights. By asking questions via chat, users can unlock advanced algorithms that detect data patterns, outliers, anomalies, key drivers and more. Insights uses AI models and evaluates incoming data to surface insights immediately to the user via web and email alerts. For the analysts and authors simply ask your point, our AI assistant at your dataset of choice and once you build a Dossier that provides a 360-degree analysis of the data in seconds. Looking forward holistically, we're developing further capabilities to extend how our line of business owners can accelerate business results across industries and departments as well as the composability of the platform to embed AI workflows and productivity into applications. As we look to expand our customer base and drive revenue growth, strategic alliances will become increasingly important. In Q2, we expanded our relationship with Microsoft, announcing a multiyear partnership that integrates the Azure OpenAI service and Microsoft 365 with MicroStrategy's advanced analytics capabilities and makes MicroStrategy available on the Azure Marketplace. Open AI has emerged as the leader in generative AI and we're excited about the Azure service and our further marketplace offering that enhances the access, speed and capabilities of MicroStrategy ONE for all our customers', current and future. The partnership between MicroStrategy and Microsoft will empower business users to make faster, more informed decisions and accelerate the development and deployment of new AI applications. Additionally, as discussed at the MicroStrategy World conference, we're actively working on our Google Cloud platform relationship and we expect to share further updates in Q4. Turning to our development of MicroStrategy Lightning, which utilizes the second layer of Lightning Network sitting on top of the bitcoin network, we envision MicroStrategy Lightning as an enterprise platform designed to leverage the power of the Bitcoin Lightning Network to enable new e-commerce use cases and tackle modern cybersecurity challenges. The first use case of the MicroStrategy Lightning platform is Lightning Rewards, which is intended to allow any enterprise to reward their employees, customers, partners and prospects for their engagement. Companies spend vast amounts of time and money in digital marketing, driving engagement with their brand and their customer, and for some, monetizing online content. We believe a platform like MicroStrategy Lightning can enable them to drive that engagement and reward their customers with that engagement directly rather than aligning the pockets of marketing or financial intermediaries. We expect future capabilities of Lightning platform will provide opportunities for new business models to monetize online content or minimize threats and the nuisance of bots and other malicious actors. While we envision Lightning as an independent product offering, it builds on our core strengths and deep expertise building highly available, easy-to-use enterprise software delivered in the cloud. While our focus remains on BI innovation, we believe we are uniquely positioned to bring value here. These incremental areas of product focus and innovation will drive MicroStrategy's strategy of being at the forefront of analytics. Turning to our Bitcoin strategy, we continue increasing our Bitcoin holdings in the second quarter. In Q2, we acquired 12,333 bitcoins, the most in a single quarter since the second quarter of 2021. After the end of Q2, we purchased an additional 467 bitcoins using cash from our operations. As of July 31, 2023, the company held 152,800 bitcoins acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion or $29,672 per bitcoin. As you know, our strategy is to acquire and hold bitcoin and we plan to continue to accumulate bitcoin over time using excess cash and with the net proceeds of capital markets transactions. Our core business is not impacted by near-term bitcoin price fluctuations. MicroStrategy is the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin in the world and we remain committed to our bitcoin acquisition strategy with a high degree of conviction, long-term focus and a risk-managed approach. Finally, before I hand it over to Andrew, I like to take a moment to discuss personnel changes this quarter. Our Chief Revenue Officer, Kevin Adkisson announced his resignation earlier in July. It's been my privilege to work with Kevin for nearly seven years and we wish him luck with his future endeavors. With Kevin's departure, I've assumed his responsibilities of head of the sales organization and sales function. I enjoy working directly with our field leaders and team as well as meeting with customers, and this will give me an opportunity to spend more time in this area. Additionally, we're excited to welcome back Saurabh Abhyankar, back to MicroStrategy as our Chief Product Officer. Saurabh brings more than 20 years of industry experience to the role and has previously served at MicroStrategy as the Senior Vice President of Product Management and also Executive Vice President of Marketing. Thus, we continue to opportunistically hire top talent worldwide. In addition, we started to return to the office to enable our employees to make the best of the convenience offered by the hybrid work model, while also benefiting from in-person interactions. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail. Thanks, Andrew. First, I'm pretty excited about our AI capabilities that we're bringing to market in Q3, so in September. And part of the capabilities will include a new product or a new skew, if you will, that will sell separately from our existing BI platform and sort of on-top of that. So I do anticipate some incremental revenue, whether it comes in Q4, whether it comes in 2024, I think time will tell as to how quickly the market is willing to adopt and pay for AI capabilities. I do think there's a couple of things that we're doing that's pretty unique from the rest of the BI market, if you will. One is, we're directly embedding open AI into the MicroStrategy Platform, which means you do not need to go and have a separate Microsoft agreement or separate open AI agreement, it will be fully embedded in the MicroStrategy Platform. And second, as you mentioned, we're going to [indiscernible] and partnering in directly with Microsoft, which there are lot of companies who are trying to build their own AI capabilities or use a different platform that's inferior at this point in time to open AI. So I think what we're going to rollout is quite differentiated. And I'm excited about the revenue opportunity that will bring. Thanks. Shirish, and. I want to thank everyone for being with us today and we appreciate your support. We're as enthusiastic as ever with both of our strategies, our enterprise software strategy and our bitcoin strategy and we wish everyone a good quarter and good rest of your summer and look-forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks. Thank you."

I will be your moderator for MicroStrategy's 2023 First Quarter Earnings Webinar. Before we proceed, I will read the Safe Harbor statement. Some of the information we provide during today's call regarding our future expectations [Technical Difficulty].\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome you all to our 2023 first quarter earnings call. We're excited to be reporting live for MicroStrategy World 2023 in Orlando, Florida. We've had a successful day one of the event today, and we're excited to see our customers, partners and employees all in person for the first time since 2020 and share our passion for BI, bitcoin and innovation. The business intelligence track tomorrow will feature MicroStrategy One and features keynotes, including how we are integrating augmented analytics, artificial intelligence to drive innovative experiences. We'll also showcase how some of the world's best brands use MicroStrategy to break through and achieve extraordinary results. This includes keynote presentations from Hilton, Sony and Amica Insurance. The Bitcoin for Corporations track on Wednesday and Lightning for Corporations track on Thursday will feature keynotes from notable institutions and industry luminaries highlighting the advantages of integrating Bitcoin and Lightning as a part of their corporate treasury and product offerings. It will be a unique gathering of corporations looking to adopt Bitcoin and Lightning strategies, and we are very excited to host this event. The conference also includes workshops, training, dedicated networking opportunities and some fun too. For those of you attending the conference in Orlando, we look forward to seeing you in person. Turning to our business results for Q1. We continue to see strong demand for MicroStrategy software, both on-premise and in the cloud with total revenue growing despite a continuing challenging macroeconomic environment. Total revenue was $121.9 million, representing an increase of 2% year-over-year or 6% on a constant currency basis. Total software licenses revenues, which consists of total product licenses and subscription services revenue and our consolidated statement of operations were $36.2 million, representing an increase of 23% year-over-year or 29% on a constant currency basis. Total subscription services revenue was $18.8 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year or 52% on a constant currency basis. Our Q1 subscription billings growth was 19% year-over-year, lower than our 2022 annualized subscription billings growth of 39%. We had a good overall revenue results in Q1 2023 and the durability of our enterprise BI platform and the depth of our existing customer base are a testament to our resiliency. However, it's important to note that difficult macro conditions continue to persist and they impact our revenue in the coming quarters. In addition to the revenue results, we also had a successful quarter with our Bitcoin strategy. We acquired 7,500 Bitcoin in Q1, the most in a single quarter since the fourth quarter of 2021 for a net aggregate purchase amount of $179 million or $23,900 per Bitcoin. As of March 31, 2023, we held a total of 140,000 Bitcoins at an aggregate cost of $4.2 billion or average cost of approximately $29,800 per Bitcoin. As you all know, our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin and we plan to continue to accumulate Bitcoin over time using our excess cash and with the net proceeds of capital markets transactions. Our core business is not impacted by near-term bitcoin price fluctuations. MicroStrategy is the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, and we remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with a high degree of conviction, long-term focus in a risk-managed approach. To conclude our business highlights, I'd like to highlight that in Q1, we repaid our $205 million Bitcoin back loan at a 22% discount. With this transaction, we recognized a $45 million gain on extinguishment of debt and eliminated annualized interest costs of more than $15 million per year. It has also released 34,619 Bitcoins that serve as collateral for this loan and which are now unencumbered. As of March 31, 2023, only 11% of our total Bitcoin holdings are pledged as collateral for debt. Next, I would like you to introduce you to MicroStrategy One. Eight years and over 2.5 million hours of engineering have resulted in MicroStrategy One, a modern, open cloud-native BI platform that can serve all the analytics needs of large enterprises. MicroStrategy One is highlighted by a modern product suite, including dossier, library, workstation and Hyperintelligence. It is fully open, built on restful APIs and Python. And because we are an independent analytics company, work seamlessly with any data sources and clients. Similarly, our cloud platform works on AWS, Microsoft Azure and soon the Google Cloud platform, supporting multi-cloud deployments through a container-based architecture. Finally, MicroStrategy One serves all major categories of analytics, self-service, business reporting, advanced applications and embedded analytics. We're the only analytics software company with this combination of capabilities which enable enterprises to get value from their customers. We're extremely proud of the work done to build MicroStrategy One and will actively migrate this innovative platform. The platform is intended to be a one-stop shop for all of our business intelligence customers and prospects. The next-generation platform is built to unleash new levels of efficiency and creativity for users. Organizations are looking to consolidate vendors to save costs, simplify deployment and maximize impact. That's where we stand out and the ability to provide a comprehensive solution. We enable migration off legacy out-of-support analytics tools and also provide a modern experience that offers enterprise great security and scalability, a reusable object model and open architecture to avoid vendor lock-in. Now while the one platform is a powerhouse that delivers on all core competencies of modern analytics, it's also a new way of talking about what MicroStrategy can do and how we can compete. MicroStrategy One is our most advanced platform to-date, it's a result of the immense dedication of the MicroStrategy teams that got us to this point, and it's the foundation for all of our future innovation. With the completion of the MicroStrategy One platform and focus on rebuilding much of our platform in the last eight years, we're now able to increasingly focus on MicroStrategy's hallmark product innovation. Our innovation is focused on four areas: one, core analytics; two, augmented analytics; three, artificial intelligence; and four, Lightning network. On the innovation side, MicroStrategy's core differentiators that position us to lead the next innovation age of analytics in a modern and open business world, our semantic graph with object reusability, enterprise-grade security and scalability, open architecture multi-cloud. We believe the future of core analytics is going to center on three key themes: empowered self-service, productivity and data personalization. One area we've heard about a great deal from our customers to self-service. Self-service is long overdue for disruption. The notion that business users have interest, let alone time to learn that offering interface is a non-starter. End users typically have no concept of your data structures and sources on your schema, providing end users with basic authoring tools may result in nonperforming dashboards and inaccurate data combinations. The shift away from single-use analysis results in true self-service through reusable content. Governed authoring is a new way, authoring experience a library that allows business users to build their own dossiers by using predefined assets in a vastly simplified experience while removing the complexities of data important blending. Our AI engine will suggest additional visualizations that may be useful to relevant or relevant to users based on ones they've already selected or based on topics they are researching. It will also ensure that the assets they are combining and their design are compatible and performing. Next is innovation on augmented analytics. MicroStrategy Insights released in September 2022 was our first set of products released in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning to augment more traditional reporting capabilities and provide contextual and immediate insights. Now integrated with MicroStrategy One, the insights feature accelerates decision-making and uncovers data patterns of automated alerting and library applications. The alerts are based on machine learning models, working behind the scenes to proactively detect data trends, outliers and anomalies, equipping users with the timely insights to drive action. This is the basis on which we are combining MicroStrategy semantic layer, Hyperintelligence and open architecture to provide data tracking alerts, forecasting and recommendations. We believe this is something MicroStrategy is uniquely positioned to provide, and we expect to release more functionality in this area every quarter. Next is further innovation and generative artificial intelligence. MicroStrategy with our semantic graph, including our metadata and platform analytics is well positioned to leverage AI-driven technologies like chat bots to drive productivity across all of personas. How AI is leveraged to integrate in organizations will become the business differentiator. Generative AI can use the semantic layer to better understand the data and its relationships, resulting in more accurate predictions, better data quality and faster actionable insights. On the Bitcoin innovation side, MicroStrategy Lightning is the new product we are developing, which utilizes the Lightning network, a second layer network. This is a top the Bitcoin network. We envision MicroStrategy Lightning as an enterprise platform designed to leverage the power of the Bitcoin Lightning network to enable new e-commerce use cases and tackle modern cybersecurity challenges. The first use case in the MicroStrategy Lightning platform is Lightning rewards. Lightning Rewards is intended to allow any enterprise to reward their employees, customers, partners and prospects for their engagement. Companies spend vast amounts of time and energy and digital marketing, driving engagement with their brand and their customers and for some monetizing online content. We believe a platform like MicroStrategy Lightning to enable them to drive that engagement rewarding their customers with that engagement directly rather than aligning the pockets of marketing or financial intermediaries. We expect future capabilities as the Lightning platform will provide opportunities for new business models to monetize online content or minimize threats in the uses of bots and other malicious actors. While we envision MicroStrategy Lightning as an independent product offering, it builds on our core strength and deep experience, building highly available, easy-to-use software delivered in the cloud. As mentioned in the last earnings call, we're taking a very disciplined investment approach such that our lighting development efforts currently occupy less than 1% of our R&D capability. While our core focus remains on BI innovation, we believe we are uniquely positioned to bring value here. We will talk about MicroStrategy Lightning further in our Lighting for Corporations event on Thursday. These incremental areas of product focused and inhibition will drive MicroStrategy's strategy of being at the forefront of analytics. I cannot be more excited about our product road map, which we will share more about tomorrow and MicroStrategy World. Last but not least, I want to take a moment to recognize our former Chief Technology Officer, Tim Lang, who retired after 8.5 years from the position of CTO with MicroStrategy. It's been my privilege to work with him over the past seven years, and we wish him the best. With Tim's departure, we'll be splitting his former responsibilities as CTO and to do two distinct organizations within our technology team. Product and engineering, both of which I will oversee. Leading our engineering organization will be Cezary Raczko, our Executive Vice President of Engineering. Cezary has been with MicroStrategy for 24 years, starting as a software engineer and growing to lead teams that have built much of our platform. I'm excited for Cezary to step into this leadership role and focus more and more on customer satisfaction as well as product innovation. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. It's great to be my first MicroStrategy world. There's a ton of energy and buzz here, and I'm definitely looking forward to meeting many of our customers as well as those interested in learning more about Bitcoin for Corporations. But let me get to our financial results. Our first quarter enterprise analytics business results were strong, showing total year-over-year revenue growth. This was in light of persisting macroeconomic headwinds, as Phong mentioned earlier, which reflects our deep customer base and the durability of our platform during economic volatility. GAAP total revenues for the quarter were $121.9 million, up $2.6 million or 2% year-over-year and up 6% year-over-year at constant currency. Total software license revenues, which made up -- make up product license revenues and subscription services revenues were $36.2 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 29% at constant currency, outperforming last year's Q1 year-over-year results. Subscription services revenues, which reflect recurring revenues from our cloud business were $18.8 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year or an increase of 52% at constant currency. Product licenses revenues were $17.4 million for the quarter, up 5% year-over-year, which reflected strong performance in our international business. Product support revenues were $65.5 million, down $1.7 million year-over-year, but were flat at constant currency. Renewal rates have remained high at over 90% in Q1, and for the last six consecutive quarters. Finally, other services revenues were $20.2 million, an increase of 11 -- sorry, 11% decrease year-over-year or a decrease of 8% at constant currency, primarily due to a decrease in our consulting revenues. On Slide 15, total current software license billings were $28.7 million in the first quarter, a slight increase of 2% year-over-year. Current subscription billings were $13.7 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year, our 12th straight quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to focus our efforts on transitioning customers to our cloud solution which includes converting existing on-premise customers and selling incremental cloud licenses. Incremental licenses will continue to come from new deployments by existing customers as well as new licenses purchased by customer prospects. We are also increasing our focus on partnerships with hyperscalers that will drive incremental cloud license opportunities in the future. In 2022, approximately 2/3 of our total revenue was recurring, and we expect this trend to improve in 2023. The transition to a subscription model will help establish high-quality annual recurring revenues that will allow us to scale and continue growing our business. Turning to Slide 16. Total non-GAAP expenses, which shown here excludes share-based compensation costs were $125 million in the first quarter compared to $275 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our total non-GAAP costs this quarter were significantly lower compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher Bitcoin impairment charges in Q1 of 2022. For this quarter, Bitcoin impairment charges were $19 million, in contrast to $170 million in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP cost of revenues was $27 million in the first quarter, an increase of $2.2 million or 9% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues, however, non-GAAP cost of revenues increased approximately 1% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in cloud hosting costs, which is a result of the increased usage by new and existing cloud subscription services partially offset by favorable currency exchange impacts. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased $2 million or 7% year-over-year to $31 million. As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP sales and marketing costs were higher by 1% year-over-year. You may recall that in Q1 of 2022, we capitalized certain commissions, which resulted in lower variable compensation costs last year. That being said, we are closely managing our headcount and salary costs, and we also revamped our sales commissions plan this year, which may shift cost to later in the year based on meeting and beating sales targets. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were $27 million, a decrease of $2.8 million or 9% year-over-year. The cost savings we are realizing now represent the benefits in investing in lower cost global delivery centers last year, such as in India, Poland, Argentina and China. And through those strategic initiatives, we are now able to further optimize spend without sacrificing on technology, talent or product development. Non-GAAP G&A costs were $20 million, a modest decrease of $500,000 or 2% year-over-year. On Slide 17, total non-GAAP operating loss in the first quarter of 2023 was $3 million, of which the loss on the digital asset impairment charge was $19 million for the quarter. The digital asset impairment charge continues to be the primary impact driver when reporting our operating results. I have highlighted in the past that today GAAP accounting policy treats our Bitcoin holdings as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which results in continuing -- and results is now continuing to recognize impairments each quarter, if there is any decrease in the fair value at any point during the quarter below our carrying value. Late last year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, unanimously voted to recommend the adoption of fair value accounting for measuring certain digital assets, which includes Bitcoin. We have only recognized impairments regardless of whether the price of Bitcoin increases as it did in Q1. However, a fair value accounting is finalized and we are able to recognize both decreases and increases in the fair market value of Bitcoin, we believe our reported earnings will be far more transparent to investors and far more relevant in how we report changes in the market price of Bitcoin and its impact on our reported quarterly results. As of March 31, 2023, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2 billion compared to approximately $4 billion in the market value of our holdings based on the Bitcoin price of approximately 28,500 as of the last day of Q1. As Bitcoin prices have continued to rally this year, as of market close on Friday, April 28, the market value of our 140,000 Bitcoins has increased to approximately $4.1 billion. That is a difference of $2.1 billion between the carrying value of our total Bitcoin holdings and the fair market value of our holdings, which could be recognized under a fair value model. On March 23, the FASB issued an exposure draft for comments that would cause an in-scope digital -- that would cause in-scope digital assets, which includes Bitcoin to be measured at fair value. The deadline for comment on the exposure draft runs through June 6. MicroStrategy is fully supportive of the newly proposed rules and improved investor transparency it brings. We plan to provide a response to FASB during the comment period, and we encourage others to voice their support as well. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin, we believe we have a responsibility to share what we have learned since embarking on our Bitcoin strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this important and innovative asset class. We remain committed as we have in the past to supporting these efforts and supporting other companies with a playbook and shared experiences to leverage Bitcoin as a treasury asset and to continue and support its adoption as a store of value for corporate balance sheets. Turning to Slide 19. In Q1, we repaid the $205 million Bitcoin backed loan at a 22% discount, recognizing a $45 million gain on the extinguishment of that debt. In addition to reducing the Company's leverage, we eliminated our highest interest rate debt, which had floated up to an annualized rate of 8.26% just prior to repayment due to the rapidly rising interest rate environment last year. By retiring the debt, we also released all of the bitcoins that were pledged as collateral securing the loan. This was an important and strategic transaction for us and our liability management goals. We now have a total of $2.2 billion of outstanding debt in convertible instruments with a blended, weighted interest rate of approximately 1.6%. This is compared to the prior blended weighted interest rate of 2.1% as of the end of 2022. The convertible senior notes carry a very low cost of capital with the earliest debt maturity not until December 2025. These notes are the most attractive in terms of cost and with over two years remaining until the earliest maturity, our outstanding long-term capital continues to be valuable and accretive to our shareholders. Lastly, our now fully fixed great annualized interest expense is $35.5 million compared to over $50 million of annualized expense prior to the end of Q1. This strengthens our overall liquidity position. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $94 million in cash on our balance sheet and our overall liquidity remains robust in order to manage our ongoing working capital needs as well as our debt service expense. Also in Q1, we continued to execute on our at-the-market or ATM equity offering and raised approximately $339 million in net proceeds through the sale of Class A common shares. We issued an aggregate of approximately 1.35 million shares of Class A common stock at an average gross price per share of $252.85. Since then, we terminated the prior $500 million ATM program, of which approximately $112 million of capacity remained. And today, we announced a new $625 million ATM program. As with the prior program, we may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin or for debt repayment or redemption. We will continue to opportunistically raise capital and use those proceeds in a way that we believe will be the most accretive to our shareholders. No shares have been issued under this new program to date. Our asset liability management efforts have pushed our earliest debt maturity from Q1 2025 to December of 2025, with no debt maturities coming due in the next two-plus years giving us more flexibility in managing our liabilities with additional time to navigate the challenges in the macroeconomic environment as well as the price fluctuality in the Bitcoin markets. In Q1, we increased our net Bitcoin position by 7,500 Bitcoins. And as of March 31, 2023, we now hold a total of 140,000 bitcoins on our balance sheet. Of our total Bitcoin holdings, 14,890 Bitcoins are held by MicroStrategy the parent and are pledged as collateral securing our 2028 secured notes. The remaining 125,110 Bitcoins are held at the MicroStrategy subsidiary, all of which now are fully unpledged and unencumbered. At the end of the quarter, 89% of our total Bitcoin holdings were unencumbered compared to 63% at the end of 2022. It's worth mentioning again and reinforcing that we only buy Bitcoin in U.S.-based markets. We only custody Bitcoin with institutional grade, U.S.-based regulated custodians in cold storage, and we have never lent out our big coin. Since the adoption of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, we have taken a simple approach to buy and hold Bitcoin. We continue -- we conduct throughout due diligence on all of our custodians and execution partners and we take steps along the way to minimize risk and ensure the highest level of compliance. We only buy Bitcoin in U.S.-based markets. Turning to Slide 22. Our outlook for 2023 remains optimistic but with a cautious eye. We anticipate modest total revenue growth this year. We expect to continue to grow cloud subscriptions as a percentage of total revenue and strengthen the quality of our recurring revenue as we continue to transform our platform. We remain disciplined on costs while investing in growth, and we will continue to execute our dual strategy of growing our business intelligence software business and acquiring Bitcoin for the future. As Phong mentioned, difficult macro conditions continue to persist, which may impact our results this year. However, we are extremely encouraged that even in this environment, an environment of constant change, MicroStrategy continues to serve its customers with an agile one-stop analytics platform with open architecture and modern cloud capabilities. Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Andrew. I would like to start with one quick review of our Bitcoin strategy. As you know, in the third quarter and the second -- the third quarter of 2020, we embarked on a strategy and an analysis to determine what we thought would be the best treasury reserve asset. And we adopted a Bitcoin strategy at that point. And we adopted Bitcoin because we thought of it as digital gold, but without any of the liabilities or imperfections of gold, and with all of the more compelling characteristics of a dominant big tech network. So we kind of -- we were looking for a Google or Facebook or Apple of digital gold. And we looked at all possibilities we considered investing in bonds, we consider silver, and we considered gold, and we considered if we could invest in big tech and we consider that we could invest in real estate or collectibles. And our conclusion at that point was that the fundamentals of Bitcoin were superior to all these other asset classes. If we wanted a non-sovereign store of value asset, then that was provably scarce that would scale as technology improved that would serve as a hedge against monetary expansion, then Bitcoin was the best choice. So you can see on this chart, the result I think I make the first point, I'm proud to say Bitcoin is the winner. Bitcoin has outperformed all the competing assets over this time period. It has outperformed all of the big tech stocks. It has outperformed all of the major enterprise software stocks. And again, I think the reason why it is a dominant digital network, and there is no dilution. It is never going to be more than 21 million Bitcoin and as the world gets educated and as they become more aware of the than Bitcoin is accreting. And you can see this is some 32 months ago and in 32 months, Bitcoin has accreted 143%. I'm happy to announce to our shareholders that MicroStrategy stock has outperformed Bitcoin. We actually started the day after August 10, with about 25% of our capital structure exposed to Bitcoin, but we have managed through a succession of disciplined and accretive capital market activities in Bitcoin investments to get full Bitcoin exposure and actually outperform the underlying Bitcoin. And so, I would attribute our performance to disciplined execution and focus both in the enterprise software business, where we've been very focused on disciplined execution and also in our Bitcoin strategy, where we've picked the right strategy, I believe, but we have also been very disciplined in our use of debt and equity and when we buy Bitcoin and how we cut it in, we manage Bitcoin. So ultimately, it's not easy to see what better strategy there might be. And so we are strong proponents of a Bitcoin strategy. And as you can see from this chart, simply acquiring and holding Bitcoin in a prudent fashion is a pretty good way to outperform the market. And we don't feel that we need to pursue other types of risk, certainly rehypothication in lending out your assets or chasing after yield constitutes additional risk and many in the crypto industry have suffered by pursuing that yield or taking those risks. We found it simply by acquiring and holding Bitcoin, we could outperform our peers and the enterprise software business. And we could even perform in a superior fashion versus big tech monopolies like Apple or Google or Microsoft. So with that, I thought I'd just share a few comments on Bitcoin in general. I would say, we're pleased with our strategy. The retirement of the Silvergate loan dramatically improved our balance sheet. Our cash position has improved. We'll continue to pursue balance sheet opportunities and financial opportunities as long as we deem them to be accretive. With regard to Bitcoin, we see Bitcoin adoption continues. The regulatory environment for Bitcoin is improving. This is not the case for the entire crypto industry, but as capital flows out of the crypto industry, it is flowing into Bitcoin. So as investors exit cryptocurrencies like the stable coins, we expect they are and they will continue to convert and invest that capital into Bitcoin. And as investors exit cryptosecurities like the crypto tokens, the other crypto asset securities that are currently they are currently under the microscope in the regulatory environment. We believe that, that capital will flow into Bitcoin. So, all of the regulatory changes in the crypto industry right now are really creating a tailwind for Bitcoin. Markets are being educated about the benefits of Bitcoin via -- or due to the banking crisis right now. And so although the banking prices and uncertainty isn't good for banks in general, it has resulted in a lot more awareness of Bitcoin's value proposition as a non-sovereign store value asset and a better instrument without counterparty risk and without the need to trust an intermediary. So Bitcoin is getting a tailwind from banking crisis. It's getting a tailwind from the crypto crisis. And the network continues to strengthen. Network security at Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bitcoin in essence, is secured by digital power, and you can measure that power in terms of exahash and the Bitcoin network trailing exahash rate is about 346 exahash. This is the all-time high. And this is -- this indicates that despite the crypto winter and despite all of the regulatory uncertainty and all of the travails of the crypto market in general, Bitcoin continues to strengthen and network security and the security capital invested in the network has never been higher. It turns out that the demand for transactions on the Bitcoin network continues to accrete as well. Transactions in the past 30 days are nearing $11 million, and this is also an all-time high. So did demand for creating transactions on the Bitcoin network has never been greater. The result of that demand for transaction bandwidth is driving up transaction fees. We view this as a good thing. Transaction fees are beneficial to Bitcoin miners, and over time, as block rewards decreased, the transaction fee revenue streams are going to increase. And as they increase, they create a very fertile and a very healthy environment for miners to secure the network. There is -- there are two trends. There is a strong trend of capital flowing from the crypto industry, cryptocurrencies, cryptosecurities and crypto exchanges, into Bitcoin, the Bitcoin network and the Bitcoin asset class. And I think that, that is certainly one of the drivers of the rally in Bitcoin over the past few months. The second major trend is a flow of development efforts from the crypto community onto the Bitcoin network and lots of developers interested in smart contracts, interested in NFTs, interested in other sorts of crypto applications, cryptosecurity, crypto functionality in general, they have started to focus upon developing on top of the Bitcoin protocol and some -- and there are a number of different ways they're doing it, but they're creating a layer two protocols and probably the most famous of those layer two protocols is the Lightning protocol. And Lightning itself is emerging as an open permissionless secure transaction protocol for the world. And of course, Lightning is based upon the underlying Bitcoin blockchain, and Lightning allows potentially unlimited scaling of Bitcoin such that you can send micro transactions of $0.01, almost instantly for a fraction of a penny. And because Lightning enables micro transactions and it enables very, very speedy transactions and it enables scalable transactions, Lightning itself is the basis for all types of applications. And holds out the promise of supporting billions of users and billions of transactions a day and allowing hundreds of thousands or millions of companies, applications and websites to interoperate, and this is something that's really, really important. We, as a company, are very enthusiastic about Lightning as technologists. And so this week, we're hosting a Bitcoin and Lightning for Corporation's conference. Turnout is really compelling. We're excited to see all of the various companies showing up and also the various Lighting application providers, Lightning wallet providers, Lightning service providers showing up to the conference with very, very interesting offerings. Lightning itself is an ecosystem and you could think of it as money over IP. But I think over time, it will be more compelling than that. It really is an open permissionless secure transaction protocol. And if you wish to integrate Apple's blue checks, with Facebook blue checks, with Twitter's blue checks, with Google's verified checks, you need an open protocol, and you need a secure protocol. And right now, there has not been one in the absence of Lighting and lighting is emerging as that protocol for any tech company to integrate value exchange, authentication, exchange, and secure transactions. So, we're really excited about the opportunity for us in the space with our MicroStrategy Lightning offering. And we're going to continue to explore that opportunity in a disciplined and thoughtful fashion, but we also expect there'll be hundreds and then thousands and then tens of thousands of other applications that are tapping into the Lightning protocol. And each of those applications creates demand to open and close lightning channels, it creates functionality and value. It creates demand for the underlying bitcoin. And if you combine that with the other bitcoin-related applications that are beginning to grow at a faster rate right now, we see this as being very auspicious for demand for Bitcoin as the asset demand for Satoshis as the gas to run the network. And it's very auspicious for support of the network. It's going to draw technology VC. It's drawing big tech and technology companies. It's drawing mainstream financial companies to take an interest in the space. Mainstream energy companies are taking a greater interest in the space as well as Bitcoin mining becomes more commercial and better understood. And as the regulatory environment clarifies and as a large portion of the crypto industry moves offshore, there is less confusion in the market, and this is beneficial to Bitcoin, Bitcoin is the primary winner of this regulatory clarity because at this point, people that weren't quite -- they don't quite understand the difference between all these cryptos are starting to see that Bitcoin is the commodity and Bitcoin is the true decentralized asset without an issuer. And from that follows an awareness of Bitcoin as being the superior commodity because it is a scarcity. It is absolutely capped. And when you combine the observation that Bitcoin is the commodity and the Bitcoin is superior to all other commodities because it is a scarcity and then you layer on to that, the Bitcoin layer two open protocols like Lightning. And then you layer on to that, the layer three applications that utilize Lightning like MicroStrategy Lightning like Cash App like the various exchanges that actually support Lightning. At that point, I think that you see that the coin has emerged as a mainstream macroeconomic asset for macro traders, but it's also emerged as an exciting new technology opportunity for technology investors. And it is both a treasury strategy for corporations. It is also a technology strategy to create compelling and exciting new products and services to differentiate a company from its competitors. And so as you can see, we're very optimistic about the outlook for Bitcoin, and we're looking forward to the coming year. We think it's going to be a good one. With that, I think we can go ahead and take questions and answers.\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. As we did not complete the full Safe Harbor statement at the beginning, I will read it before we begin the Q&A. So safe harbor statement is some of the information we provide during today's call and what we provided regarding our future expectations, plans and prospects may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements due to various important factors, including the risk factors discussed in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today. Also, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results are available in our earnings release and presentation which were issued today and are available on our website at microstrategy.com. Now we'll jump into the questions. And the first question is for Phong. Could you update us on the progress of your cloud product and capabilities and how customer migrations are faring today? What are your expectations for cloud business growth against the macro backdrop?\nPhong Le: Thanks, Shirish. I think as everyone saw, our cloud revenue results continue to progress in a pretty good direction with growth nearing 50% on a year-over-year basis. As far as our product evolution, big highlights this year, we've launched on AWS and on Azure. Second half of last year, we launched our FedRAMP cloud, which we actually brought on our first customer this quarter in Q1. And later in this year, we plan to also offer Google Cloud Platform in MicroStrategy Cloud Enterprise too. And obviously, we're doing a lot on the automation side. We're continuing to work on micro services and our container-based strategy. But it's a big area of continued innovation. And obviously, our multi-cloud strategy is very attractive to large enterprises. Looking forward to continued growth, we had a little bit of a slowdown in cloud billings, 19% year-over-year growth in Q1. I think that speaks a little bit to the macroeconomic environment and a little bit of a slowdown in some deals. But I do anticipate cloud is going to be a big driver of growth going forward. And you probably see the positive impact it's having on our revenue already.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. Thank you, Phong. Next question is for Michael. In light of the recent events and the broader crypto market, what do you think are the key catalysts for more adoption of Bitcoin by institutions? And how does the recent volatility in the banking markets intersect with potential Bitcoin adoption?\nMichael Saylor: I think that the FASB fair accounting determination will be an important catalyst I think there are a lot of very conservative corporations that will be reluctant to put material amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheet as long as they have the current indefinite intangible treatment. So, I think fair value is important milestone. I think that when there is -- when there is a national security exchange, a regulated national securities exchange trading Bitcoin, I think that will be a big milestone. So when the uncertainty lifts around crypto exchanges in the U.S., I think when we get more clarity on stable coin usage from regulators, I think that will be a big milestone. I expect that will probably drive a lot of Bitcoin adoption. I think that with regard to the banking environment, all of the uncertainty in the banking environment is driving awareness of Bitcoin's value proposition. And there's a set of mainstream investors that have not really understood Bitcoin or they haven't understood what Bitcoin was good for until now. And it's beginning to -- it's very clear that it's resonating with lots of mainstream investors that Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace, that offers an alternative to those that don't have a bank they can trust. And there's -- most American investors haven't really been focused upon the problem of unreliable currency and an unreliable bank because they've always had reliable banks and a reliable currency. But of course, everywhere in South America, everywhere in Africa, most places in Asia, the population doesn't have a reliable currency and it doesn't have a reliable bank. They can't buy dollars even if they wanted to buy dollars. And if they did buy dollars, if they have to buy them from a bank and the bank is under the control of a government, when the government gets in trouble, they freeze all the dollars in the bank. They convert the dollars back into local currency. They devalue the local currency. And so, the plight of investors in Lebanon or Syria or in Argentina or whatever has been not on the radar of mainstream investors. But of course, with the failure of First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank and other banks, it's now on the radar of Wall Street. And I think the Wall Street is now realizing that if they're insecure about their money in a U.S. bank, then maybe they empathize more with the end securities of foreigners with their money in foreign banks and foreign currencies. So all of these things are driving awareness and awareness drives adoption. Because as soon as a mainstream investor acknowledges that Bitcoin is an asset class, a legitimate asset class, then they're already underexposed. All we need to do in order to be successful is simply to get a mainstream investor to acknowledge that Bitcoin is an asset, whether it's a correlated asset, an uncorrelated asset or not, doesn't really even matter. It doesn't matter if they're long or short. If they view it as a legitimate asset class, they're underexposed. And the combination of all these developments in the crypto market and regulatory advances as well as all of the struggles of the banking sector have an impact of educating people on Bitcoins, differentiating and unique characteristics.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. The next question is for Andrew. Can you explain the significantly large swing in the GAAP earnings? It looks like there was a tax impact this quarter as it relates to Bitcoin. Can you please clarify how that all works?\nAndrew Kang: Shirish. You should give me the fun one, I guess. Sure. The general accounting and tax concepts is as we've seen are not very easily understood as it exists today, which is why we welcome some of the anticipated changes in the accounting rules that Michael just mentioned. That being said, I'll try and walk you through some high-level math. We had a deferred tax asset on 3/31, which was $653 million, and it is mostly based on the tax effect of a cumulative impairments that we've taken on our Bitcoin holdings over time. If you recall, at the end of last year, we recognized a large valuation of allowance, which was about $500 million because the coin prices were at the lows of about $16,500 at the time versus a cost basis of just over $30,000. Fast forward to 3/31, as Bitcoin price increased to about $28,500 we released about $456 million of that valuation we took at the end of last year, which in turn drove the large tax benefit line item in our Q1 income statement. I mean, look, we saw Bitcoin prices decline last year. We are on the receiving end of a lot of focus on reported losses we took. We now see the coin price drive higher. I think this is an example of the reversal of those hits. We took last year and a benefit as we see prices continue to improve. Hopefully, we'll get the similar recognition for these types of improvements as we did when Bitcoin price was trending downward. Hopefully, that helps.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. Next question is for Phong. So Phong, lots of great commentary in the presentation today on the innovation side, can you please provide some guidance on if there's any expectation around when the new areas of innovation start to contribute to the revenues?\nPhong Le: Yes. I think it would be premature to anticipate any direct revenue attribution for our innovations. We're doing a lot in the core BI side. We're doing a lot on augmented analytics. We're doing a lot on artificial intelligence and Lightning those are sort of the four big areas beyond sort of what we've been working on in the cloud. As we release these products to market and experience the uptake and solidify how we're going to price them, we'll figure out more, but I think it's a little early right now to attribute any of the innovation directly to revenue. But in the next 6 to 12 months, we'll be able to answer that question better.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. Next one is for Phong as well. If it has been different or difficult to sell expansion deals in the current macro environment as tech companies change their head counts.\nPhong Le: Yes. I think it's hard to say exactly what's happening from a macroeconomic side. But I would say, if you look at our financials, there's a couple of indicators. One is we're seeing our services revenue slow down a little bit and that's usually an indication of financial belt tightening by IT groups and companies in general, especially in technology focused companies. And the second is we did see a little bit of a slowdown in cloud growth. Now I think that's probably more seasonal and potentially not going to continue, but it did indicate delayed sales cycles, some belt tightening of budgets. So, how the rest of the year will go is hard to anticipate. But I do think at this point in time, as Andrew said, it's to be cautious, good to be prudent overall.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Phong. And we'll take one last question here for Andrew. So as a follow-up to the change in the accounting rules you mentioned, can you please provide any thoughts on the impact of FASB's decision and whether you have an expected time line for the rule implementation?\nAndrew Kang: Sure. Thanks, Shirish. As I mentioned on the call, we believe the rule will -- changing the fair value is the right change. We support the draft that the FASB has put out. I think it provides the better transparency that we've been advocating for since we took on our Bitcoin strategy, and we think it will open the door to more people thinking about Bitcoin on their balance sheet. As for timing, I certainly can't speculate when the rule will become final, but the comment period ends in early June, and we certainly hope that this is something that will hopefully take place before the end of the year. So, we -- I guess we have our fingers crossed, but thanks for the question.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. So thank you, everyone, for the question. And this concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar. I will now turn the call over to Phong for his closing remarks.\nPhong Le: I want to thank everyone for being us with us today. I appreciate your support. For those who are here with us at MicroStrategy World, live in person. I look forward to having an opportunity to meet you in person live also. We're as enthusiastic as ever about our enterprise software strategy as well as our Bitcoin strategy. And we wish you a good quarter and look forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks. Thanks, everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. I would like to start with one quick review of our Bitcoin strategy. As you know, in the third quarter and the second -- the third quarter of 2020, we embarked on a strategy and an analysis to determine what we thought would be the best treasury reserve asset. And we adopted a Bitcoin strategy at that point. And we adopted Bitcoin because we thought of it as digital gold, but without any of the liabilities or imperfections of gold, and with all of the more compelling characteristics of a dominant big tech network. So we kind of -- we were looking for a Google or Facebook or Apple of digital gold. And we looked at all possibilities we considered investing in bonds, we consider silver, and we considered gold, and we considered if we could invest in big tech and we consider that we could invest in real estate or collectibles. And our conclusion at that point was that the fundamentals of Bitcoin were superior to all these other asset classes. If we wanted a non-sovereign store of value asset, then that was provably scarce that would scale as technology improved that would serve as a hedge against monetary expansion, then Bitcoin was the best choice. So you can see on this chart, the result I think I make the first point, I'm proud to say Bitcoin is the winner. Bitcoin has outperformed all the competing assets over this time period. It has outperformed all of the big tech stocks. It has outperformed all of the major enterprise software stocks. And again, I think the reason why it is a dominant digital network, and there is no dilution. It is never going to be more than 21 million Bitcoin and as the world gets educated and as they become more aware of the than Bitcoin is accreting. And you can see this is some 32 months ago and in 32 months, Bitcoin has accreted 143%. I'm happy to announce to our shareholders that MicroStrategy stock has outperformed Bitcoin. We actually started the day after August 10, with about 25% of our capital structure exposed to Bitcoin, but we have managed through a succession of disciplined and accretive capital market activities in Bitcoin investments to get full Bitcoin exposure and actually outperform the underlying Bitcoin. And so, I would attribute our performance to disciplined execution and focus both in the enterprise software business, where we've been very focused on disciplined execution and also in our Bitcoin strategy, where we've picked the right strategy, I believe, but we have also been very disciplined in our use of debt and equity and when we buy Bitcoin and how we cut it in, we manage Bitcoin. So ultimately, it's not easy to see what better strategy there might be. And so we are strong proponents of a Bitcoin strategy. And as you can see from this chart, simply acquiring and holding Bitcoin in a prudent fashion is a pretty good way to outperform the market. And we don't feel that we need to pursue other types of risk, certainly rehypothication in lending out your assets or chasing after yield constitutes additional risk and many in the crypto industry have suffered by pursuing that yield or taking those risks. We found it simply by acquiring and holding Bitcoin, we could outperform our peers and the enterprise software business. And we could even perform in a superior fashion versus big tech monopolies like Apple or Google or Microsoft. So with that, I thought I'd just share a few comments on Bitcoin in general. I would say, we're pleased with our strategy. The retirement of the Silvergate loan dramatically improved our balance sheet. Our cash position has improved. We'll continue to pursue balance sheet opportunities and financial opportunities as long as we deem them to be accretive. With regard to Bitcoin, we see Bitcoin adoption continues. The regulatory environment for Bitcoin is improving. This is not the case for the entire crypto industry, but as capital flows out of the crypto industry, it is flowing into Bitcoin. So as investors exit cryptocurrencies like the stable coins, we expect they are and they will continue to convert and invest that capital into Bitcoin. And as investors exit cryptosecurities like the crypto tokens, the other crypto asset securities that are currently they are currently under the microscope in the regulatory environment. We believe that, that capital will flow into Bitcoin. So, all of the regulatory changes in the crypto industry right now are really creating a tailwind for Bitcoin. Markets are being educated about the benefits of Bitcoin via -- or due to the banking crisis right now. And so although the banking prices and uncertainty isn't good for banks in general, it has resulted in a lot more awareness of Bitcoin's value proposition as a non-sovereign store value asset and a better instrument without counterparty risk and without the need to trust an intermediary. So Bitcoin is getting a tailwind from banking crisis. It's getting a tailwind from the crypto crisis. And the network continues to strengthen. Network security at Bitcoin is at an all-time high. Bitcoin in essence, is secured by digital power, and you can measure that power in terms of exahash and the Bitcoin network trailing exahash rate is about 346 exahash. This is the all-time high. And this is -- this indicates that despite the crypto winter and despite all of the regulatory uncertainty and all of the travails of the crypto market in general, Bitcoin continues to strengthen and network security and the security capital invested in the network has never been higher. It turns out that the demand for transactions on the Bitcoin network continues to accrete as well. Transactions in the past 30 days are nearing $11 million, and this is also an all-time high. So did demand for creating transactions on the Bitcoin network has never been greater. The result of that demand for transaction bandwidth is driving up transaction fees. We view this as a good thing. Transaction fees are beneficial to Bitcoin miners, and over time, as block rewards decreased, the transaction fee revenue streams are going to increase. And as they increase, they create a very fertile and a very healthy environment for miners to secure the network. There is -- there are two trends. There is a strong trend of capital flowing from the crypto industry, cryptocurrencies, cryptosecurities and crypto exchanges, into Bitcoin, the Bitcoin network and the Bitcoin asset class. And I think that, that is certainly one of the drivers of the rally in Bitcoin over the past few months. The second major trend is a flow of development efforts from the crypto community onto the Bitcoin network and lots of developers interested in smart contracts, interested in NFTs, interested in other sorts of crypto applications, cryptosecurity, crypto functionality in general, they have started to focus upon developing on top of the Bitcoin protocol and some -- and there are a number of different ways they're doing it, but they're creating a layer two protocols and probably the most famous of those layer two protocols is the Lightning protocol. And Lightning itself is emerging as an open permissionless secure transaction protocol for the world. And of course, Lightning is based upon the underlying Bitcoin blockchain, and Lightning allows potentially unlimited scaling of Bitcoin such that you can send micro transactions of $0.01, almost instantly for a fraction of a penny. And because Lightning enables micro transactions and it enables very, very speedy transactions and it enables scalable transactions, Lightning itself is the basis for all types of applications. And holds out the promise of supporting billions of users and billions of transactions a day and allowing hundreds of thousands or millions of companies, applications and websites to interoperate, and this is something that's really, really important. We, as a company, are very enthusiastic about Lightning as technologists. And so this week, we're hosting a Bitcoin and Lightning for Corporation's conference. Turnout is really compelling. We're excited to see all of the various companies showing up and also the various Lighting application providers, Lightning wallet providers, Lightning service providers showing up to the conference with very, very interesting offerings. Lightning itself is an ecosystem and you could think of it as money over IP. But I think over time, it will be more compelling than that. It really is an open permissionless secure transaction protocol. And if you wish to integrate Apple's blue checks, with Facebook blue checks, with Twitter's blue checks, with Google's verified checks, you need an open protocol, and you need a secure protocol. And right now, there has not been one in the absence of Lighting and lighting is emerging as that protocol for any tech company to integrate value exchange, authentication, exchange, and secure transactions. So, we're really excited about the opportunity for us in the space with our MicroStrategy Lightning offering. And we're going to continue to explore that opportunity in a disciplined and thoughtful fashion, but we also expect there'll be hundreds and then thousands and then tens of thousands of other applications that are tapping into the Lightning protocol. And each of those applications creates demand to open and close lightning channels, it creates functionality and value. It creates demand for the underlying bitcoin. And if you combine that with the other bitcoin-related applications that are beginning to grow at a faster rate right now, we see this as being very auspicious for demand for Bitcoin as the asset demand for Satoshis as the gas to run the network. And it's very auspicious for support of the network. It's going to draw technology VC. It's drawing big tech and technology companies. It's drawing mainstream financial companies to take an interest in the space. Mainstream energy companies are taking a greater interest in the space as well as Bitcoin mining becomes more commercial and better understood. And as the regulatory environment clarifies and as a large portion of the crypto industry moves offshore, there is less confusion in the market, and this is beneficial to Bitcoin, Bitcoin is the primary winner of this regulatory clarity because at this point, people that weren't quite -- they don't quite understand the difference between all these cryptos are starting to see that Bitcoin is the commodity and Bitcoin is the true decentralized asset without an issuer. And from that follows an awareness of Bitcoin as being the superior commodity because it is a scarcity. It is absolutely capped. And when you combine the observation that Bitcoin is the commodity and the Bitcoin is superior to all other commodities because it is a scarcity and then you layer on to that, the Bitcoin layer two open protocols like Lightning. And then you layer on to that, the layer three applications that utilize Lightning like MicroStrategy Lightning like Cash App like the various exchanges that actually support Lightning. At that point, I think that you see that the coin has emerged as a mainstream macroeconomic asset for macro traders, but it's also emerged as an exciting new technology opportunity for technology investors. And it is both a treasury strategy for corporations. It is also a technology strategy to create compelling and exciting new products and services to differentiate a company from its competitors. And so as you can see, we're very optimistic about the outlook for Bitcoin, and we're looking forward to the coming year. We think it's going to be a good one. With that, I think we can go ahead and take questions and answers. I think that the FASB fair accounting determination will be an important catalyst I think there are a lot of very conservative corporations that will be reluctant to put material amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheet as long as they have the current indefinite intangible treatment. So, I think fair value is important milestone. I think that when there is -- when there is a national security exchange, a regulated national securities exchange trading Bitcoin, I think that will be a big milestone. So when the uncertainty lifts around crypto exchanges in the U.S., I think when we get more clarity on stable coin usage from regulators, I think that will be a big milestone. I expect that will probably drive a lot of Bitcoin adoption. I think that with regard to the banking environment, all of the uncertainty in the banking environment is driving awareness of Bitcoin's value proposition. And there's a set of mainstream investors that have not really understood Bitcoin or they haven't understood what Bitcoin was good for until now. And it's beginning to -- it's very clear that it's resonating with lots of mainstream investors that Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace, that offers an alternative to those that don't have a bank they can trust. And there's -- most American investors haven't really been focused upon the problem of unreliable currency and an unreliable bank because they've always had reliable banks and a reliable currency. But of course, everywhere in South America, everywhere in Africa, most places in Asia, the population doesn't have a reliable currency and it doesn't have a reliable bank. They can't buy dollars even if they wanted to buy dollars. And if they did buy dollars, if they have to buy them from a bank and the bank is under the control of a government, when the government gets in trouble, they freeze all the dollars in the bank. They convert the dollars back into local currency. They devalue the local currency. And so, the plight of investors in Lebanon or Syria or in Argentina or whatever has been not on the radar of mainstream investors. But of course, with the failure of First Republic and Silicon Valley Bank and other banks, it's now on the radar of Wall Street. And I think the Wall Street is now realizing that if they're insecure about their money in a U.S. bank, then maybe they empathize more with the end securities of foreigners with their money in foreign banks and foreign currencies. So all of these things are driving awareness and awareness drives adoption. Because as soon as a mainstream investor acknowledges that Bitcoin is an asset class, a legitimate asset class, then they're already underexposed. All we need to do in order to be successful is simply to get a mainstream investor to acknowledge that Bitcoin is an asset, whether it's a correlated asset, an uncorrelated asset or not, doesn't really even matter. It doesn't matter if they're long or short. If they view it as a legitimate asset class, they're underexposed. And the combination of all these developments in the crypto market and regulatory advances as well as all of the struggles of the banking sector have an impact of educating people on Bitcoins, differentiating and unique characteristics."

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you, Phong. It's great to be my first MicroStrategy world. There's a ton of energy and buzz here, and I'm definitely looking forward to meeting many of our customers as well as those interested in learning more about Bitcoin for Corporations. But let me get to our financial results. Our first quarter enterprise analytics business results were strong, showing total year-over-year revenue growth. This was in light of persisting macroeconomic headwinds, as Phong mentioned earlier, which reflects our deep customer base and the durability of our platform during economic volatility. GAAP total revenues for the quarter were $121.9 million, up $2.6 million or 2% year-over-year and up 6% year-over-year at constant currency. Total software license revenues, which made up -- make up product license revenues and subscription services revenues were $36.2 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 29% at constant currency, outperforming last year's Q1 year-over-year results. Subscription services revenues, which reflect recurring revenues from our cloud business were $18.8 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year or an increase of 52% at constant currency. Product licenses revenues were $17.4 million for the quarter, up 5% year-over-year, which reflected strong performance in our international business. Product support revenues were $65.5 million, down $1.7 million year-over-year, but were flat at constant currency. Renewal rates have remained high at over 90% in Q1, and for the last six consecutive quarters. Finally, other services revenues were $20.2 million, an increase of 11 -- sorry, 11% decrease year-over-year or a decrease of 8% at constant currency, primarily due to a decrease in our consulting revenues. On Slide 15, total current software license billings were $28.7 million in the first quarter, a slight increase of 2% year-over-year. Current subscription billings were $13.7 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year, our 12th straight quarter of double-digit growth. We continue to focus our efforts on transitioning customers to our cloud solution which includes converting existing on-premise customers and selling incremental cloud licenses. Incremental licenses will continue to come from new deployments by existing customers as well as new licenses purchased by customer prospects. We are also increasing our focus on partnerships with hyperscalers that will drive incremental cloud license opportunities in the future. In 2022, approximately 2/3 of our total revenue was recurring, and we expect this trend to improve in 2023. The transition to a subscription model will help establish high-quality annual recurring revenues that will allow us to scale and continue growing our business. Turning to Slide 16. Total non-GAAP expenses, which shown here excludes share-based compensation costs were $125 million in the first quarter compared to $275 million in the first quarter of 2022. Our total non-GAAP costs this quarter were significantly lower compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to higher Bitcoin impairment charges in Q1 of 2022. For this quarter, Bitcoin impairment charges were $19 million, in contrast to $170 million in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP cost of revenues was $27 million in the first quarter, an increase of $2.2 million or 9% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenues, however, non-GAAP cost of revenues increased approximately 1% year-over-year, primarily due to the increase in cloud hosting costs, which is a result of the increased usage by new and existing cloud subscription services partially offset by favorable currency exchange impacts. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses increased $2 million or 7% year-over-year to $31 million. As a percentage of total revenues, non-GAAP sales and marketing costs were higher by 1% year-over-year. You may recall that in Q1 of 2022, we capitalized certain commissions, which resulted in lower variable compensation costs last year. That being said, we are closely managing our headcount and salary costs, and we also revamped our sales commissions plan this year, which may shift cost to later in the year based on meeting and beating sales targets. Non-GAAP research and development expenses were $27 million, a decrease of $2.8 million or 9% year-over-year. The cost savings we are realizing now represent the benefits in investing in lower cost global delivery centers last year, such as in India, Poland, Argentina and China. And through those strategic initiatives, we are now able to further optimize spend without sacrificing on technology, talent or product development. Non-GAAP G&A costs were $20 million, a modest decrease of $500,000 or 2% year-over-year. On Slide 17, total non-GAAP operating loss in the first quarter of 2023 was $3 million, of which the loss on the digital asset impairment charge was $19 million for the quarter. The digital asset impairment charge continues to be the primary impact driver when reporting our operating results. I have highlighted in the past that today GAAP accounting policy treats our Bitcoin holdings as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which results in continuing -- and results is now continuing to recognize impairments each quarter, if there is any decrease in the fair value at any point during the quarter below our carrying value. Late last year, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, unanimously voted to recommend the adoption of fair value accounting for measuring certain digital assets, which includes Bitcoin. We have only recognized impairments regardless of whether the price of Bitcoin increases as it did in Q1. However, a fair value accounting is finalized and we are able to recognize both decreases and increases in the fair market value of Bitcoin, we believe our reported earnings will be far more transparent to investors and far more relevant in how we report changes in the market price of Bitcoin and its impact on our reported quarterly results. As of March 31, 2023, the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings was approximately $2 billion compared to approximately $4 billion in the market value of our holdings based on the Bitcoin price of approximately 28,500 as of the last day of Q1. As Bitcoin prices have continued to rally this year, as of market close on Friday, April 28, the market value of our 140,000 Bitcoins has increased to approximately $4.1 billion. That is a difference of $2.1 billion between the carrying value of our total Bitcoin holdings and the fair market value of our holdings, which could be recognized under a fair value model. On March 23, the FASB issued an exposure draft for comments that would cause an in-scope digital -- that would cause in-scope digital assets, which includes Bitcoin to be measured at fair value. The deadline for comment on the exposure draft runs through June 6. MicroStrategy is fully supportive of the newly proposed rules and improved investor transparency it brings. We plan to provide a response to FASB during the comment period, and we encourage others to voice their support as well. As the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin, we believe we have a responsibility to share what we have learned since embarking on our Bitcoin strategy to make it easier for other companies to diversify their balance sheet with this important and innovative asset class. We remain committed as we have in the past to supporting these efforts and supporting other companies with a playbook and shared experiences to leverage Bitcoin as a treasury asset and to continue and support its adoption as a store of value for corporate balance sheets. Turning to Slide 19. In Q1, we repaid the $205 million Bitcoin backed loan at a 22% discount, recognizing a $45 million gain on the extinguishment of that debt. In addition to reducing the Company's leverage, we eliminated our highest interest rate debt, which had floated up to an annualized rate of 8.26% just prior to repayment due to the rapidly rising interest rate environment last year. By retiring the debt, we also released all of the bitcoins that were pledged as collateral securing the loan. This was an important and strategic transaction for us and our liability management goals. We now have a total of $2.2 billion of outstanding debt in convertible instruments with a blended, weighted interest rate of approximately 1.6%. This is compared to the prior blended weighted interest rate of 2.1% as of the end of 2022. The convertible senior notes carry a very low cost of capital with the earliest debt maturity not until December 2025. These notes are the most attractive in terms of cost and with over two years remaining until the earliest maturity, our outstanding long-term capital continues to be valuable and accretive to our shareholders. Lastly, our now fully fixed great annualized interest expense is $35.5 million compared to over $50 million of annualized expense prior to the end of Q1. This strengthens our overall liquidity position. As of the end of the first quarter, we had $94 million in cash on our balance sheet and our overall liquidity remains robust in order to manage our ongoing working capital needs as well as our debt service expense. Also in Q1, we continued to execute on our at-the-market or ATM equity offering and raised approximately $339 million in net proceeds through the sale of Class A common shares. We issued an aggregate of approximately 1.35 million shares of Class A common stock at an average gross price per share of $252.85. Since then, we terminated the prior $500 million ATM program, of which approximately $112 million of capacity remained. And today, we announced a new $625 million ATM program. As with the prior program, we may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin or for debt repayment or redemption. We will continue to opportunistically raise capital and use those proceeds in a way that we believe will be the most accretive to our shareholders. No shares have been issued under this new program to date. Our asset liability management efforts have pushed our earliest debt maturity from Q1 2025 to December of 2025, with no debt maturities coming due in the next two-plus years giving us more flexibility in managing our liabilities with additional time to navigate the challenges in the macroeconomic environment as well as the price fluctuality in the Bitcoin markets. In Q1, we increased our net Bitcoin position by 7,500 Bitcoins. And as of March 31, 2023, we now hold a total of 140,000 bitcoins on our balance sheet. Of our total Bitcoin holdings, 14,890 Bitcoins are held by MicroStrategy the parent and are pledged as collateral securing our 2028 secured notes. The remaining 125,110 Bitcoins are held at the MicroStrategy subsidiary, all of which now are fully unpledged and unencumbered. At the end of the quarter, 89% of our total Bitcoin holdings were unencumbered compared to 63% at the end of 2022. It's worth mentioning again and reinforcing that we only buy Bitcoin in U.S.-based markets. We only custody Bitcoin with institutional grade, U.S.-based regulated custodians in cold storage, and we have never lent out our big coin. Since the adoption of our Bitcoin acquisition strategy, we have taken a simple approach to buy and hold Bitcoin. We continue -- we conduct throughout due diligence on all of our custodians and execution partners and we take steps along the way to minimize risk and ensure the highest level of compliance. We only buy Bitcoin in U.S.-based markets. Turning to Slide 22. Our outlook for 2023 remains optimistic but with a cautious eye. We anticipate modest total revenue growth this year. We expect to continue to grow cloud subscriptions as a percentage of total revenue and strengthen the quality of our recurring revenue as we continue to transform our platform. We remain disciplined on costs while investing in growth, and we will continue to execute our dual strategy of growing our business intelligence software business and acquiring Bitcoin for the future. As Phong mentioned, difficult macro conditions continue to persist, which may impact our results this year. However, we are extremely encouraged that even in this environment, an environment of constant change, MicroStrategy continues to serve its customers with an agile one-stop analytics platform with open architecture and modern cloud capabilities. Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Shirish. You should give me the fun one, I guess. Sure. The general accounting and tax concepts is as we've seen are not very easily understood as it exists today, which is why we welcome some of the anticipated changes in the accounting rules that Michael just mentioned. That being said, I'll try and walk you through some high-level math. We had a deferred tax asset on 3/31, which was $653 million, and it is mostly based on the tax effect of a cumulative impairments that we've taken on our Bitcoin holdings over time. If you recall, at the end of last year, we recognized a large valuation of allowance, which was about $500 million because the coin prices were at the lows of about $16,500 at the time versus a cost basis of just over $30,000. Fast forward to 3/31, as Bitcoin price increased to about $28,500 we released about $456 million of that valuation we took at the end of last year, which in turn drove the large tax benefit line item in our Q1 income statement. I mean, look, we saw Bitcoin prices decline last year. We are on the receiving end of a lot of focus on reported losses we took. We now see the coin price drive higher. I think this is an example of the reversal of those hits. We took last year and a benefit as we see prices continue to improve. Hopefully, we'll get the similar recognition for these types of improvements as we did when Bitcoin price was trending downward. Hopefully, that helps. Sure. Thanks, Shirish. As I mentioned on the call, we believe the rule will -- changing the fair value is the right change. We support the draft that the FASB has put out. I think it provides the better transparency that we've been advocating for since we took on our Bitcoin strategy, and we think it will open the door to more people thinking about Bitcoin on their balance sheet. As for timing, I certainly can't speculate when the rule will become final, but the comment period ends in early June, and we certainly hope that this is something that will hopefully take place before the end of the year. So, we -- I guess we have our fingers crossed, but thanks for the question."

            "name": "Phong Le",
            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome you all to our 2023 first quarter earnings call. We're excited to be reporting live for MicroStrategy World 2023 in Orlando, Florida. We've had a successful day one of the event today, and we're excited to see our customers, partners and employees all in person for the first time since 2020 and share our passion for BI, bitcoin and innovation. The business intelligence track tomorrow will feature MicroStrategy One and features keynotes, including how we are integrating augmented analytics, artificial intelligence to drive innovative experiences. We'll also showcase how some of the world's best brands use MicroStrategy to break through and achieve extraordinary results. This includes keynote presentations from Hilton, Sony and Amica Insurance. The Bitcoin for Corporations track on Wednesday and Lightning for Corporations track on Thursday will feature keynotes from notable institutions and industry luminaries highlighting the advantages of integrating Bitcoin and Lightning as a part of their corporate treasury and product offerings. It will be a unique gathering of corporations looking to adopt Bitcoin and Lightning strategies, and we are very excited to host this event. The conference also includes workshops, training, dedicated networking opportunities and some fun too. For those of you attending the conference in Orlando, we look forward to seeing you in person. Turning to our business results for Q1. We continue to see strong demand for MicroStrategy software, both on-premise and in the cloud with total revenue growing despite a continuing challenging macroeconomic environment. Total revenue was $121.9 million, representing an increase of 2% year-over-year or 6% on a constant currency basis. Total software licenses revenues, which consists of total product licenses and subscription services revenue and our consolidated statement of operations were $36.2 million, representing an increase of 23% year-over-year or 29% on a constant currency basis. Total subscription services revenue was $18.8 million, an increase of 46% year-over-year or 52% on a constant currency basis. Our Q1 subscription billings growth was 19% year-over-year, lower than our 2022 annualized subscription billings growth of 39%. We had a good overall revenue results in Q1 2023 and the durability of our enterprise BI platform and the depth of our existing customer base are a testament to our resiliency. However, it's important to note that difficult macro conditions continue to persist and they impact our revenue in the coming quarters. In addition to the revenue results, we also had a successful quarter with our Bitcoin strategy. We acquired 7,500 Bitcoin in Q1, the most in a single quarter since the fourth quarter of 2021 for a net aggregate purchase amount of $179 million or $23,900 per Bitcoin. As of March 31, 2023, we held a total of 140,000 Bitcoins at an aggregate cost of $4.2 billion or average cost of approximately $29,800 per Bitcoin. As you all know, our strategy is to acquire and hold Bitcoin and we plan to continue to accumulate Bitcoin over time using our excess cash and with the net proceeds of capital markets transactions. Our core business is not impacted by near-term bitcoin price fluctuations. MicroStrategy is the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, and we remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with a high degree of conviction, long-term focus in a risk-managed approach. To conclude our business highlights, I'd like to highlight that in Q1, we repaid our $205 million Bitcoin back loan at a 22% discount. With this transaction, we recognized a $45 million gain on extinguishment of debt and eliminated annualized interest costs of more than $15 million per year. It has also released 34,619 Bitcoins that serve as collateral for this loan and which are now unencumbered. As of March 31, 2023, only 11% of our total Bitcoin holdings are pledged as collateral for debt. Next, I would like you to introduce you to MicroStrategy One. Eight years and over 2.5 million hours of engineering have resulted in MicroStrategy One, a modern, open cloud-native BI platform that can serve all the analytics needs of large enterprises. MicroStrategy One is highlighted by a modern product suite, including dossier, library, workstation and Hyperintelligence. It is fully open, built on restful APIs and Python. And because we are an independent analytics company, work seamlessly with any data sources and clients. Similarly, our cloud platform works on AWS, Microsoft Azure and soon the Google Cloud platform, supporting multi-cloud deployments through a container-based architecture. Finally, MicroStrategy One serves all major categories of analytics, self-service, business reporting, advanced applications and embedded analytics. We're the only analytics software company with this combination of capabilities which enable enterprises to get value from their customers. We're extremely proud of the work done to build MicroStrategy One and will actively migrate this innovative platform. The platform is intended to be a one-stop shop for all of our business intelligence customers and prospects. The next-generation platform is built to unleash new levels of efficiency and creativity for users. Organizations are looking to consolidate vendors to save costs, simplify deployment and maximize impact. That's where we stand out and the ability to provide a comprehensive solution. We enable migration off legacy out-of-support analytics tools and also provide a modern experience that offers enterprise great security and scalability, a reusable object model and open architecture to avoid vendor lock-in. Now while the one platform is a powerhouse that delivers on all core competencies of modern analytics, it's also a new way of talking about what MicroStrategy can do and how we can compete. MicroStrategy One is our most advanced platform to-date, it's a result of the immense dedication of the MicroStrategy teams that got us to this point, and it's the foundation for all of our future innovation. With the completion of the MicroStrategy One platform and focus on rebuilding much of our platform in the last eight years, we're now able to increasingly focus on MicroStrategy's hallmark product innovation. Our innovation is focused on four areas: one, core analytics; two, augmented analytics; three, artificial intelligence; and four, Lightning network. On the innovation side, MicroStrategy's core differentiators that position us to lead the next innovation age of analytics in a modern and open business world, our semantic graph with object reusability, enterprise-grade security and scalability, open architecture multi-cloud. We believe the future of core analytics is going to center on three key themes: empowered self-service, productivity and data personalization. One area we've heard about a great deal from our customers to self-service. Self-service is long overdue for disruption. The notion that business users have interest, let alone time to learn that offering interface is a non-starter. End users typically have no concept of your data structures and sources on your schema, providing end users with basic authoring tools may result in nonperforming dashboards and inaccurate data combinations. The shift away from single-use analysis results in true self-service through reusable content. Governed authoring is a new way, authoring experience a library that allows business users to build their own dossiers by using predefined assets in a vastly simplified experience while removing the complexities of data important blending. Our AI engine will suggest additional visualizations that may be useful to relevant or relevant to users based on ones they've already selected or based on topics they are researching. It will also ensure that the assets they are combining and their design are compatible and performing. Next is innovation on augmented analytics. MicroStrategy Insights released in September 2022 was our first set of products released in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning to augment more traditional reporting capabilities and provide contextual and immediate insights. Now integrated with MicroStrategy One, the insights feature accelerates decision-making and uncovers data patterns of automated alerting and library applications. The alerts are based on machine learning models, working behind the scenes to proactively detect data trends, outliers and anomalies, equipping users with the timely insights to drive action. This is the basis on which we are combining MicroStrategy semantic layer, Hyperintelligence and open architecture to provide data tracking alerts, forecasting and recommendations. We believe this is something MicroStrategy is uniquely positioned to provide, and we expect to release more functionality in this area every quarter. Next is further innovation and generative artificial intelligence. MicroStrategy with our semantic graph, including our metadata and platform analytics is well positioned to leverage AI-driven technologies like chat bots to drive productivity across all of personas. How AI is leveraged to integrate in organizations will become the business differentiator. Generative AI can use the semantic layer to better understand the data and its relationships, resulting in more accurate predictions, better data quality and faster actionable insights. On the Bitcoin innovation side, MicroStrategy Lightning is the new product we are developing, which utilizes the Lightning network, a second layer network. This is a top the Bitcoin network. We envision MicroStrategy Lightning as an enterprise platform designed to leverage the power of the Bitcoin Lightning network to enable new e-commerce use cases and tackle modern cybersecurity challenges. The first use case in the MicroStrategy Lightning platform is Lightning rewards. Lightning Rewards is intended to allow any enterprise to reward their employees, customers, partners and prospects for their engagement. Companies spend vast amounts of time and energy and digital marketing, driving engagement with their brand and their customers and for some monetizing online content. We believe a platform like MicroStrategy Lightning to enable them to drive that engagement rewarding their customers with that engagement directly rather than aligning the pockets of marketing or financial intermediaries. We expect future capabilities as the Lightning platform will provide opportunities for new business models to monetize online content or minimize threats in the uses of bots and other malicious actors. While we envision MicroStrategy Lightning as an independent product offering, it builds on our core strength and deep experience, building highly available, easy-to-use software delivered in the cloud. As mentioned in the last earnings call, we're taking a very disciplined investment approach such that our lighting development efforts currently occupy less than 1% of our R&D capability. While our core focus remains on BI innovation, we believe we are uniquely positioned to bring value here. We will talk about MicroStrategy Lightning further in our Lighting for Corporations event on Thursday. These incremental areas of product focused and inhibition will drive MicroStrategy's strategy of being at the forefront of analytics. I cannot be more excited about our product road map, which we will share more about tomorrow and MicroStrategy World. Last but not least, I want to take a moment to recognize our former Chief Technology Officer, Tim Lang, who retired after 8.5 years from the position of CTO with MicroStrategy. It's been my privilege to work with him over the past seven years, and we wish him the best. With Tim's departure, we'll be splitting his former responsibilities as CTO and to do two distinct organizations within our technology team. Product and engineering, both of which I will oversee. Leading our engineering organization will be Cezary Raczko, our Executive Vice President of Engineering. Cezary has been with MicroStrategy for 24 years, starting as a software engineer and growing to lead teams that have built much of our platform. I'm excited for Cezary to step into this leadership role and focus more and more on customer satisfaction as well as product innovation. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail. Thanks, Shirish. I think as everyone saw, our cloud revenue results continue to progress in a pretty good direction with growth nearing 50% on a year-over-year basis. As far as our product evolution, big highlights this year, we've launched on AWS and on Azure. Second half of last year, we launched our FedRAMP cloud, which we actually brought on our first customer this quarter in Q1. And later in this year, we plan to also offer Google Cloud Platform in MicroStrategy Cloud Enterprise too. And obviously, we're doing a lot on the automation side. We're continuing to work on micro services and our container-based strategy. But it's a big area of continued innovation. And obviously, our multi-cloud strategy is very attractive to large enterprises. Looking forward to continued growth, we had a little bit of a slowdown in cloud billings, 19% year-over-year growth in Q1. I think that speaks a little bit to the macroeconomic environment and a little bit of a slowdown in some deals. But I do anticipate cloud is going to be a big driver of growth going forward. And you probably see the positive impact it's having on our revenue already. Yes. I think it would be premature to anticipate any direct revenue attribution for our innovations. We're doing a lot in the core BI side. We're doing a lot on augmented analytics. We're doing a lot on artificial intelligence and Lightning those are sort of the four big areas beyond sort of what we've been working on in the cloud. As we release these products to market and experience the uptake and solidify how we're going to price them, we'll figure out more, but I think it's a little early right now to attribute any of the innovation directly to revenue. But in the next 6 to 12 months, we'll be able to answer that question better. Yes. I think it's hard to say exactly what's happening from a macroeconomic side. But I would say, if you look at our financials, there's a couple of indicators. One is we're seeing our services revenue slow down a little bit and that's usually an indication of financial belt tightening by IT groups and companies in general, especially in technology focused companies. And the second is we did see a little bit of a slowdown in cloud growth. Now I think that's probably more seasonal and potentially not going to continue, but it did indicate delayed sales cycles, some belt tightening of budgets. So, how the rest of the year will go is hard to anticipate. But I do think at this point in time, as Andrew said, it's to be cautious, good to be prudent overall. I want to thank everyone for being us with us today. I appreciate your support. For those who are here with us at MicroStrategy World, live in person. I look forward to having an opportunity to meet you in person live also. We're as enthusiastic as ever about our enterprise software strategy as well as our Bitcoin strategy. And we wish you a good quarter and look forward to seeing you again in 12 weeks. Thanks, everyone."

With that, I will now turn the call over to Phong Le, President and CEO of MicroStrategy.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish. Hello everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar, starting with the Bitcoin highlights for Q3. 2024 MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, now holding 252,220 Bitcoins with a total Bitcoin market value of $18 billion as of yesterday. Since June 30, 2024, we acquired an additional 25,889 Bitcoin for a total purchase cost of $1.6 billion, an average price of $60,839. Year-to-date, 2024, the price of Bitcoin has appreciated, spurred notably by the approval of the Spot Bitcoin Exchange traded products or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention to the asset class. We believe the introduction and initial success of the Spot Bitcoin ETPs evidences the maturation of Bitcoin as an institution grade asset class, with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption. On the capital markets front, we made significant progress towards the advancement of our Bitcoin strategy. In September, we raised $1.1 billion net proceeds, through our at-the-market, or ATM, equity offering program and raised $1.01 billion through the issuance of our 2028 convertible notes. Using part of the proceeds from the 2028 convertible notes, we also redeemed our $500 million senior secured notes, due 2028 in full. As a result, all of our Bitcoin holdings are now unencumbered. Andrew will provide further details on our capital markets and Bitcoin purchase activity for this quarter. As we continue to focus on acquiring more Bitcoin through our capital market activities, we believe that the value proposition in the company centers increasingly on our Bitcoin treasury strategy. As a result, we've developed a new descriptor for what we are, which is the world's first and largest Bitcoin treasury company, the acronym being coincidentally BTC. So what does this mean? We are a publicly traded company that has adopted Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset. By using proceeds from equity and debt financings, as well as cash flows from our operations, we strategically accumulate Bitcoin and advocate for its role as digital capital. Our treasury strategy is designed to provide investors varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin, by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments. In addition, we provide industry leading AI-powered enterprise analytics software, advancing our vision of intelligence everywhere. We leverage our development capabilities, to explore innovation in Bitcoin applications. Integrating analytics expertise with our commitment to digital asset growth. We believe our combination of operational excellence, our strategic Bitcoin reserve and our focus on technological innovation, positions us as a leader in both the digital asset and enterprise analytics sectors, offering a unique opportunity for long-term value creation. Michael will further elaborate on our vision as a Bitcoin treasury company. Since our adoption of our Bitcoin strategy, we've used three primary mechanisms to acquire more Bitcoin. One, debt financing we have $4.3 billion in principal amount of convertible debt outstanding and an attractive blended cost of debt fixed at 0.8% annually. Two, equity issuances, we've issued $4.3 billion in equity in a manner that we believe to be accretive to existing shareholders, and three cash flows from our software operations. Since August 2020, we've invested $836 million of total cash on our balance sheet. These capital market levers allow us to deploy intelligent leverage to increase our Bitcoin holdings in a manner, which we believe shareholder value. So where do we go next from here? For those who are familiar with the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, they would know, what is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything. In this science fiction series, an enormous supercomputer named Deep Thought calculated the answer to this question over a period of 7.5 million years. And of course, the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is the number 42. We also think it's the answer to important question. And we spent about four years thinking about this question. We believe it's a unique number with some special characteristics. It's the sum of 21 plus 21. And we all know that 21 is a magic, a magical number. In the world of Bitcoin, there can only ever be a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins in circulation. MicroStrategy owns about 1.2% of this Bitcoin today. Today, MicroStrategy is announcing its ambitious capital market strategic plan for the next three years, from the years 2025 to 2027, the company is targeting to raise $42 billion of capital, comprised of $21 billion of equity capital and $21 billion of fixed income capital, primarily for the purpose of acquiring Bitcoin. Today, we have filed a prospectus supplement for a new $21 billion ATM equity program. This is the largest ATM in the history of capital markets. Fixed income capital can consist of various debt and debt like instruments, including convertible debt, preferred equity, hybrid capital or other similar instruments. So I'd like to provide more detail on our capital raising targets over the next three years. For the year 2025, we target raising $10 billion total comprised of approximately $5 billion each of equity capital, and fixed income capital. For the year 2026, we target raising $14 billion, comprised of approximately $7 billion each of equity capital, and fixed income capital. And for the year 2027, we target raising $18 billion, comprised of approximately $9 billion each of equity capital and fixed income capital. We plan to address increased interest costs from any incremental fixed income capital raise, through efficient management of our overall capital raising plan, including alternating between equity raises and debt raises as appropriate. To maintain our overall intelligent leverage. By managing our treasury strategy in this way, so long as we continued access to equity capital in favorable terms. We believe we will not be limited by the cash flows from our software business, to scale up our Bitcoin capital markets initiatives. Turning to the software business, MicroStrategy is also positioned as the world's largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company. In the third quarter of 2024, we continued our shift towards our cloud offering, non-GAAP subscription billings, which represent cloud revenues in the quarter, along with just the next 12 months of deferred subscription services, revenues grew by 93% in Q3 to $32.4 million, our fourth straight year of quarterly double-digit growth. The strong growth in our subscription billings, was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud, and new customer wins. Our customer renewal rates continue to remain high, and our subscription services revenues remain strong. Overall, we see strong demand for our cloud platform, and Q3 was a particularly strong quarter for customers migrating to the cloud. Our objective continues to be to increase cloud revenue by migrating customers to cloud, while maintaining profitability. MicroStrategy ONE, is now available on Azure, AWS and Google Cloud marketplaces, allowing enterprises to easily find and deploy this cloud native platform. Customers can benefit from a range of innovative first to market AI powered functionality, powered by the Azure OpenAI LLM, which also creates demand for our cloud platform. Transitioning our customer base to the technology of the future remains a key focus, and our hyperscaler partners are a key part of this migration. As customers and prospects move to the cloud to empower their AI driven digital transformations, we expect to continue to see, a decrease in product license revenues and support revenues, which will in part be offset by increases in subscription services revenues. We expect this trend to continue in the balance of 2024. This may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short-term, but in the long run we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenues. Additional benefits include more engaged customers using our very latest software, higher retention rates, and ultimately growing recurring in overall revenues. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew, to discuss our financials for the first quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you Phong. First, I'll take a few minutes to expand upon the software business results. Moving to Slide 12, earlier this year we enhanced our reported numbers to breakout our quarterly results into two categories. First, the software business category reflects income or loss from operations related specifically to our BI business. The Corporate and other category represents the non-software related areas, associated with our digital assets holdings, which include impairment charges and other related third-party costs. While we continue to operate under one reportable operating segment. We believe the breakout of our operating results into these two categories, provides more transparency with respect to the performance of our software business, while isolating the impacts related to changes in Bitcoin price. In Q3, software business revenues were $116 million, down 10% year-over-year consistent with recent quarters, the overall revenue trend reflects the ongoing transition of our business from on-premise to cloud. As part of that transition, we fully expect product license along with support revenues, to decline impacting total revenues consistent with this quarter's results. We are building up stronger, more durable cloud recurring revenues that come in overtime, which is consistent for any on-prem to cloud transition. Q3 Cloud bookings was strong in line with the prior quarter and if you recall, Q2 was the strongest single quarter cloud bookings to-date. This increase last quarter helps offset the lower than expected product license contracts, we closed this quarter and reflects the transition taking shape. As Phong mentioned earlier, non-GAAP subscription billings, which represent cloud revenues in the quarter, along with the next 12 months of deferred subscription services revenues, grew by 93% in Q3 year-over-year to $32.4 million, reflecting double-digit growth in every quarter, for the last four straight years since launching our cloud transition. Q3 subscription services revenues, increased 32% year-over-year and now make up approximately 24% of total revenues. Subscription services revenues are now larger than our product license revenues, and will continue to grow while product license revenue will continue to decline further going forward. While we will see the initial benefits of last quarter's strong cloud migrations, flow through revenue beginning next quarter, the lower product license bookings in 2024, will result in recognized revenue below our target for the full year, but in line with the revised target we discussed last quarter. We expect this year and next year will reflect the transition point in our long-term strategy after, which we expect total revenues will begin to grow again. Cost of revenues were $34 million, which was up 29% compared to Q3 of last year. The increase was due in part to higher cloud hosting costs, a direct result of our growing cloud, which we expect to continue in future periods. Software business operating expenses were $100 million, up 7% compared to Q3 of last year, while overall personnel costs were down year-over-year. The increase that I just described year-over-year, was in part largely attributed to higher stock-based compensation, and higher custody fees related to our increased Bitcoin Holdings, but also offset by savings in other G&A categories. In Q3, we also recognized close to $14 million in severance costs related to workforce optimization in the quarter, which will result in approximately $30 million in lower salary costs next year. This strategic planning across all departments in the company, is focused on right sizing overall staffing levels, optimizing organizational structures, and focusing on a disciplined performance management culture. As a result, annual staffing costs are expected to be approximately 13% lower next year, which will further benefit our margin profile in 2025. Overall non-GAAP operating income or profit from the software business category, was $0.9 million. Lastly, the corporate and other operating expense category for the quarter was $414 million, the majority of, which was due to Bitcoin impairment in Q3. Now turning to our Bitcoin strategy, we had another very successful quarter in adding more Bitcoin to our treasury reserves, as we acquired 25,889 Bitcoins in the third quarter for approximately $1.6 billion at an average price of $60,839 per Bitcoin. As of September 30, the company held a total of 252,200 Bitcoins acquired for an aggregate cost of $9.9 billion, or approximately $39,000 per Bitcoin. I will speak to our overall treasury operations for the quarter in a moment, but a significant result of redeeming our 2028 senior secured notes in Q3, was to release all Bitcoin that was held at the MicroStrategy entity. And now 100% of our Bitcoin holdings, are fully unencumbered, including now all Bitcoins held at both macro strategy and MicroStrategy entities. We have added Bitcoin to our treasury balance sheet in every quarter since August 2020, and as we continue to champion Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset, we are encouraged by the number of both public and private companies that are adopting the Bitcoin treasury standard, to help impact shareholder value. As of September 30, 2024, the market value of our Bitcoin holdings was $16 billion at an aggregate cost of $9.9 billion, and an average purchase price of $39,000. This is in contrast to the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings of $6.9 billion as of the last day of the quarter. We will adopt the new FASB fair - accounting rule, which will require fair value treatment for Bitcoin holdings when the rule takes effect in Q1, 2025. As of January 1, 2025, we will recognize a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance of our retained earnings, reflecting in large part the significant difference between the market value, and carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings. Now turning to our treasury operations, we had one of our most impactful quarters from a capital markets execution perspective. Following the two convertible note financings we completed earlier in March and in June of this year, we executed a new convertible note financing in September, which was upsized and well received by the market. We issued $1.01 billion of convertible senior notes, due September 2028, at an annual interest rate of 0.625% with a conversion premium of 40%, and a conversion price of approximately $183 per share. The net proceeds from the new convert, were used to redeem the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, and to acquire additional Bitcoin. We redeemed in full the $500 million 2028 senior secured notes, at a redemption price equal to 103.063% of the principal amount of the 2028 secured notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We achieved multiple benefits through early redemption. All restrictive covenants in connection with the secured notes were eliminated, all of our Bitcoin holdings became fully unencumbered, and we realized a net annualized interest expense savings of $24 million for the next four years, equaling close to $100 million in total future debt expense savings. In Q3, we also issued $1.1 billion worth of common equity under our at-the-market ATM program. Under the existing ATM program, approximately $891 million of common equity remains available for issuance. As Phong mentioned earlier today, as part of our new 21/21 three-year strategic capital plan, we filed a new prospectus supplement for a $21 billion ATM program. This will be the single largest ATM program filed in the U.S. across all sectors. Under our current capital structure, we now have $4.3 billion of unsecured convertible debt outstanding with a sub 1% blended interest rate of approximately 0.81%, with staggered maturities over several years starting in February 2027, through June 2032, all which are currently trading above parents. Year-to-date 2024, we are the number one issuer of convertible notes in the U.S. by aggregate principal raised. Intelligent leverage remains a key component of our active capital allocation strategy, which when deployed in a thoughtful and disciplined manner, enables us to add more Bitcoin to our treasury reserve, at an attractive cost and in a manner that achieves BTC yield. I'll elaborate on the intelligent leverage and BTC yield concepts in the next few slides. This slide lays out our debt maturity profile, and as you can see, the nearest debt maturity is more than two years away and not until early 2027. The remainder of our debt maturities, are evenly spread over several years out to 2032 with and weighted average debt maturity of approximately five years. We actively monitor the capital markets, and will continuously evaluate liability management opportunities, to manage our debt and interest expense, as well as opportunities to raise additional financings in the future. Year-to-date in 2024, our total Bitcoin holdings increased by 33.3%. During the same period, our assumed diluted shares outstanding increased by only 13.2%. When we refer to assumed diluted shares outstanding, we are assuming all outstanding convertible notes are fully converted, at their respective conversion prices, all outstanding options are fully exercised, and all restricted stock units and performance stock units fully vest in each case without regard to exercise or conversion price, or vesting or any other contractual condition. As a Bitcoin treasury company-based on market conditions, we intend to continue to access equity capital markets, and to explore various opportunities in the debt and fixed income capital markets, to effectively manage our overall leverage. Our track record of using equity, debt and excess cash to acquire Bitcoin, as part of our treasury operations has resulted in value creation for our shareholders and establishes the foundation to execute on our 21/21 capital plan. Our objective continues to be to accumulate Bitcoin holdings, at a faster rate than we issue shares, and we have demonstrated a solid track record of doing so. To assess our performance in achieving this strategic objective, we introduced a new key performance indicator last quarter, which we refer to as BTC yield. To reiterate again, we define BTC yield as a period-to-period percentage change in the ratio of our total Bitcoin holdings, to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. We use this KPI to help assess the achievement of our strategic objective, and to evaluate capital allocation decisions. If we increase our total Bitcoin holdings over a given period, at a faster pace, then we increase our assumed diluted shares outstanding, we achieve a positive BTC yield. I should note here that BTC yield, is not equivalent to yield in the traditional financial context. It is simply a measure of the percentage change period-to-period in the ratio of our Bitcoin holdings, to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. In addition, when we use BTC yield, we assume that all indebtedness will be refinanced or, in the case of our convertible notes, converted into shares of common stock, at their respective conversion prices, and that it does not take into account debt and or other liabilities. Although BTC yield is not actually a yield in the traditional sense. We internally think about this metric, as some might think about a bond yield, or a yield of another financial instrument. We view this metric as helping us and our shareholders assess, whether we're using our capital most efficiently to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time. The historical performance of this KPI is shown on this slide, we achieved an annual BTC yield of 43.3% in 2021, 1.8% in 2022 and 7.3% in 2023. As we have achieved quarterly BTC yield of 8.1% in Q1, 3.7% in Q2, and 5.1% in Q3. Management uses BTC yield, to evaluate capital allocation decisions, and to measure the achievement of our strategy. Achieving BTC yield sets us apart from Spot Bitcoin ETPs and other Bitcoin investment vehicles that charge a management fee, and would therefore reflect a negative BTC yield as we measure it. Building on the 21/21 Plan Phong discussed, we have a clear strategy to increase our Bitcoin holdings and deliver a positive annual BTC yield. Our year-to-date 2024 BTC yield of 17.8% has surpassed the annual BTC yield in 2023. Last quarter, we laid out our target to achieve a BTC yield of 4% to 8% annually for the next three years through 2027. Today, we are revising our target up to achieve BTC yield of 6% to 10% per year for each of the next three years. To do this, we will seek to accumulate more Bitcoin holdings, by responsibly using intelligent leverage, with a risk managed approach, using proceeds from equity when we believe accretive and using the excess cash generated by our software business. We will continue to consider the full spectrum of financing options, and also explore creative capital, market transactions and untapped pools of capital. To execute this strategy effectively and prudently. We will remain disciplined in the use of both the ATM, and other capital raising alternatives and financings, doing so in a manner to achieve BTC yield in line with our targets. By providing a three year KPI, we are reinforcing our goal of achieving consistent positive BTC yield over time. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of institutional Bitcoin adoption, and as we look to the future, we anticipate that our ability to consistently achieve BTC yield, will become a crucial benchmark for investors. MicroStrategy has demonstrated a strong track record, of applying a disciplined approach to navigate through volatile times in the Bitcoin market. And we believe we have established the credibility, to execute on our strategic goal of adding value for our shareholders. Thank you for your time today, and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Andrew. I'm delighted to see you all on the call today. Thank you for joining us. And for all of our shareholders, thank you for your support. I was really excited about this call, because this is the chance to share our strategy and our vision looking out over the next three years. And we're going to be doing it, more detailed than we have in the past. So Shirish, go ahead to the next slide. I don't have to remind anybody that we're still in the early stage of adoption of Bitcoin as Digital Capital. 2024 has been a great year. The launch of the ETFs at the beginning of the year, was a major milestone. The embrace of Bitcoin by major political parties is a second milestone. I think we can see movement toward normalization of Bitcoin. The approval of options trading that's moving through the pipeline for the ETFs is a big deal. The movements toward banks beginning to custody Bitcoin, is very exciting. A lot of companies adopted fair value accounting this year. That's another exciting milestone. And of course, anybody that's been paying attention to the flows into the Bitcoin ETFs have noticed, that they've been picking up over the past few weeks. And it's generally acknowledged that these Bitcoin Spot ETFs, are the most successful ETFs ever launched. And so, while we're early, it's very promising. Bitcoin's about a $1.4 trillion asset class. And as you can see, Bitcoin is gradually going to draw capital from equities, from real estate, from bonds, from currency derivatives, and of course from gold. We can go to the next slide. This is a -- it's a very powerful slide, because it tells the story of investing in finance over the past four years. Since MicroStrategy adopted the Bitcoin standard in August 10th of 2020, bonds are down 5% a year. As you'll recall, we had $500 million of our treasury in bonds, substantially all of it. So we were invested in the far right side of this curve and we saw it as being a dead end and we needed to find something else. And you can see since that time, there has been an expansion of the money supply. Probably the best surrogate for that expansion is the S&P 500. And you can see the SP 500 is up 14%. 14% is effectively the traditional cost of capital for 20th century assets, for financial assets, for physical assets. If you're getting less than 14%, you're losing wealth, you're losing purchasing power, and you're not meeting the cost of capital in the mainstream. If you're ahead of 14%, then you're accreting power. And so, you can see what's happening is gold can't keep up, bonds don't work, real estate is trying to keep up, but it doesn't. The Magnificent Seven are doing double. The great companies, the Apples, the Amazons, the Googles, the Facebooks, they're actually outstripping the S&P. And of course, as they outstrip the S&P, most of the other companies in the S&P are falling behind. Bitcoin has far outstripped the Magnificent Seven. If you've been following our journey, you know that our thesis was bitcoin is like the Facebook of money or the Google of money. It is the dominant digital monetary network. It's a network that everybody in the world needs. Nobody in the world can stop. And most conventional investors don't understand. That has always been the thesis. Bitcoin is proving that it is incredible. It is the strongest asset. MicroStrategy threw its lot in with bitcoin, but I'm happy to say here today that not only has MicroStrategy managed to become 100% bitcoin, we've managed to almost 2x the performance of bitcoin. And we've done it through taking advantage of our unique opportunities and our unique capabilities as an operating company to assume intelligent leverage, to sell volatility and to manage our balance sheet. So this is just a -- it's a great outcome. Shall we go to the next slide? Not only is MicroStrategy outperforming asset classes, it turns out that MicroStrategy has outperformed all 500 of the S&P 500. So we looked at everybody. We even looked at companies that weren't in the S&P 500 on August 10, like Tesla, like Super Microsoft. And MicroStrategy is in essence, using a bitcoin strategy, come out of Nowhere to get 1989% growth in the equity value over this time period. And you can see it's not even close, right? I mean, we've dramatically outperformed Super Micro. We've dramatically outperformed Nvidia. And then when you get down to the number 5 or number 6 company, we're 4x. And so this is really a testament to the power of digital capital, if you understand it properly. Let's go to the next slide. We're a very special company in a lot of ways now. You can compare us to bitcoin. If you're comparing MicroStrategy to holding a diversified portfolio of the S&P and Nasdaq, you can see we're far outperforming. I mean, this chart really is showing that the bitcoin is the winning asset class by far. Bitcoin is really compelling because not only is it beating all the other major asset classes, but in terms of assets that a publicly traded operating company could hold, an operating company could hold a small portion of securities. It could hold a lot of bonds, or it could hold bitcoin. And so you see, when you look at that chart, it's not even close. There's one good answer for a treasury reserve asset. There's one not good answer. And there's a lot of imperfect solutions that you can't easily hold because of a 40% limit on securities in your portfolio as an operating company. You can also see our performance against big tech stocks. And of course, they're all great companies. But at the end of the day, these companies haven't embraced digital capital. And so, of course, the winner, Nvidia, has embraced digital intelligence. But digital intelligence is not an easy strategy to copy. What I say often is, if you can copy Nvidia, go ahead, have at it. I don't think it's easy to copy. MicroStrategy, on the other hand, you can copy. It is easy to copy. We've been publishing the Playbook and we continue to do so enthusiastically. And so, MicroStrategy doesn't just represent a company that made a good investment at the right time. We really represent the beginning of a wave of digital transformation of capital. The capital markets are transforming. Bitcoin is digital capital. In time, dozens of companies will realize this, then hundreds, then thousands. Next slide. The conundrum for most companies is like 1% of the companies in the S&P 500 are generating most of the gain. 99% of the companies can't keep up. And so, the Magnificent Seven steal the show. Most companies underperform. Bitcoin is dramatically beating the Magnificent Seven. And your best hope to actually keep up with the Magnificent Seven is construct a bitcoin strategy. And of course, if it's a levered long strategy, you beat everybody, next slide. Now, here's an interesting insight that we haven't ever shown before in one of these calls. MicroStrategy is not just the number one performing stock out of the S&P 500. We're also the most volatile stock. And there's a conventional wisdom in finance, which is volatility is bad and you shouldn't take risk with your balance sheet. But we're turning that conventional wisdom on its head. When you basically invest all of your capital into treasuries, when you're on the UST standard, you're stripping the volatility down to a vol of five. Bitcoin is a volume of 50 or 55. When you strip to the vol of five, what it means is your returns are 10% weaker than the S&P index. You're generating 10% less than the cost of capital. So capital becomes toxic to the company when you actually eschew volatility and you eschew bitcoin. When you embrace volatility, then you're outperforming the S&P. And now the capital isn't toxic, the capital is healthy. So a company with a conventional strategy strips the volatility, embraces low risk treasuries, loses 10% of its capital every year. Its equity markets die. Its option markets become unhealthy. It becomes a sick company. Only they don't know they're sick because conventional wisdom says that's the right thing to do. And by the time they've stripped the volatility off their balance sheet and stripped the volatility off their P&L, they have damped their appeal to the capital markets. And then you ask the question, why do you even want to be a public company if you're not actually tapping into the capital markets in order to provide them with a public security that's interesting for them to buy, sell, trade, talk about hedge arbitrage, et cetera. So this volatility has a very interesting effect, and I'll show it on the next slide, Shirish? If you look at the top 10 performers in the S&P 500, and you consider options open interest, MicroStrategy is actually number seven. We're in the Top 10, even though we're much, much smaller than most of these companies, right? Obviously, we're not as big as a Walmart or Coca Cola or a McDonald's or any of the household names you've heard about your entire life. But of course, because we're high volatility, the options market wants to trade those options. So we jump into the Top 10 leaderboard because we have a high volatility balance sheet. If we look at daily trading volume and the Top 10, you can see MicroStrategy again jumps to number seven. We're in the Top 10 out of all the S&P 500 companies in daily trading volume. And it's a pretty extraordinary outcome given the fact that in some cases these companies are 100 times bigger than us. And of course, if you look at the impact of that volatility on a market cap weighted basis, if you compare open interest in the options market as a percentage of market cap for all 500 companies in the S&P 500, MicroStrategy is number one. We are the most optioned, optionable per weight or per market cap stock in this entire universe. And if you look at daily trading volume, the liquidity of the equity as a percentage of market cap, we are also number one. Another way to say it is MicroStrategy is the hottest stock in this universe, right? Volatility is vitality, as we say. What's interesting about this is I describe volatility as like RPM on an engine. And if you have RPM on a small paper straw and you spin it 50 times a minute, it's like a kid's toy. And then if you take that paper straw and you replace it with a five pound dumbbell and you spin it 50 times a minute, it's a weapon. Now, if you put some leverage on it, if you extend it by 50% more and it goes to 90 RPM, it gets quite scary. Now imagine what happens when you put $18 billion of capital into a balance sheet and you spin it 90 or a 100 RPM. You've got a turbine. You have a motor that will move an aircraft carrier, right? You can move a small city or light up a city with it. The conventional wisdom in the market is capital is toxic. Give it back to the shareholders, make it go away, dividend it out, buy the stock back, get rid of the money. And if you're going to keep the money, invest it in a five vol asset, which is like take your money, put it in the basement and lock the vault and then make sure it never moves. It's dead money. MicroStrategy's approach is to embrace the volatility, embrace an asset that is outperforming the S&P. And in that world, instead of being negatively polarized to capital, we are positively polarized to capital. The more capital that we gather, the more powerful we become and the more we enrich our own shareholders. This is -- it's totally counterintuitive because everybody else in the world thinks you sell equity, you dilute the shareholders. That's true. If you don't have a use of proceeds that grows faster and yields more than the S&P 500 index, the cost of capital is the S&P 500. If you want to be positively polarized to capital, you want two conditions. You want to be able to invest the capital in something that beats the S&P consistently. That's the first condition. It needs to have performance. The second condition is you want velocity. You'd like to invest the capital in five days, not five years. If you can invest the capital in five days and then you can show that it actually beat the S&P index, then you've actually got the Holy Grail. Now you've got a magnet which is attracting capital. And MicroStrategy has pioneered this by combining capital markets activity with bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. With the embrace of BTC yield and BCT yield shows that in fact we acquired the capital in a manner that was accretive to our shareholders as opposed to dilutive. And that means that when we're actually engaging in capital markets activity, we're doing it in an accretive high velocity fashion. That, of course, is what is driving this trading volume, what's driving this open interest. And of course, because we have the volatility, many of the things we do are actually selling the volatility, recycling the proceeds of the volatility back into bitcoin and then delivering that to our shareholders in the form of a BTC yield. Shall we go to the next slide? Now here's another slide that no one's ever seen before in one of our presentations, many of you know about MSTR stock. And what I've said is, oh, MSTR stock, it's beaten the S&P 500. And now some of you know about options. MSTR options are more traded pound for pound than anything else in the S&P 500. And so you know that we are the volatility winner. You know that we're liquidity winner. You know we're the performance winner. What you might not know is that MicroStrategy has sold six convertible bonds. And if you had bought any of them Europe 224%, 86%, 67%, 90%, 41% or 54%, they've all been successful. They've been some of the most successful bonds ever sold to the convertible bond market. They're extraordinary in that regard. But here's the real extraordinary aha. How do you buy bitcoin at the all-time high? Get the upside of bitcoin and get your principal protection and get the downside protected. How do you strip the volatility and the risk off of the investment and keep the performance? You can't do that with an ETF. You can't do it with a straight equity that's 100% upside, 100% downside. But if you look at the chart on the right and this is just, it'll just blew me away when I saw it. You realize bitcoin has delivered 47% performance since those bonds were sold. And our bonds delivered 90% performance. And what that means is if you had bought a million dollars of bitcoin on the day we sold the 25 convert, or a million dollars of the convert, or if you just across all of these, you bought a million dollars of each of them in the convert, you would have got a 90% return. And if you had bought a million dollars of bitcoin, you would have got a 47% return. So not only do you get the return of bitcoin, you also get the downside protection. And in this particular case, I'm kind of delighted to say we outperform bitcoin not with our equity, we outperform bitcoin with our bonds. Now people, they struggle with what is MicroStrategy's unique advantage in the market? What justifies the market capitalization of the company? Well, one very obvious thing is we are the primary, perhaps the major creator of or issuer of bitcoin backed bonds in the world. And we're able to do these at scale and we've got the credibility to issue them. We've got the know-how to issue them and we have the permanent capital, we have the $18 billion of permanent bitcoin and we have the large equity market cap that provides the floor that provides the credit for a bond buyer. And yet you couldn't really reproduce this performance. If you took $300 billion of cash in treasury bills and you sold these convertible bonds, well, you could guarantee that the buyer of the bond gets their money back. But you wouldn't be able to beat bitcoin performance. You would be lucky to be able to beat the U.S. treasury performance. And so if you're going to issue bitcoin backed bonds or convertible bonds like this, you need to be 100% bitcoin and it needs to be permanent capital. You need to know that you've got it and no one's going to call it away from you. So MicroStrategy has got a very exciting business here. This is right now the best understood part of our fixed income strategy. And it's not the only thing we can do. But what you can see is that we have very successfully executed this strategy to the benefit of the bondholders and of course, also to the benefit of the equity holders. Next slide. There's a lot of confusion in the market. I mean, MicroStrategy is misunderstood. It's a little bit underestimated. I think the company is undervalued. And it starts from this observation that MicroStrategy is just a holding company that has some bitcoin on its balance sheet that trades at a premium. And somehow people that are short the company, they want to work through this logic of maybe the company's just worth its net asset value and a little bit of a premium. But that's like saying a bank is only worth its net, it's book value of its capital or maybe, you know, Apple computer. 98.5% of Apple is based on forward expectations of the business, and only 1.5% is based upon the liquid assets of the company, so most companies are valued based upon their operations and their reserves. And so if we think about MicroStrategy as a bitcoin treasury company, what are we doing? Well, we are plugged into the macro economy. The macro economy is being driven by technology, by inflation, by entropy, by chaos. And that macro economy drives the crypto economy. The crypto economy trades 24x7, 365 and people move around all the crypto assets and they also trade back and forth bitcoin. And that's what makes it very volatile. That's why you can sell a billion dollars on Saturday night. That's why you can buy a billion dollars of it on Sunday morning, right? The crypto economy, or the crypto exchanges plugged into bitcoin, they are picking up the vibrations and the sentiments and the positive and negative developments of the macro economy. Now, why do people go to bitcoin? Capital preservation and productivity. And of course, they will continue to do that. And that's a $1.4 trillion asset class. Now, bitcoin is a commodity. It's a digital commodity. MicroStrategy taps into that digital commodity with our treasury operations. And one thing we do is acquire bitcoin. We acquire the bitcoin. We custody the bitcoin and we do that on behalf of our investors because many of them either can't or choose not to hold bitcoin and custody of the bitcoin. We also issue securities like our equity and like our convertible bonds. And we adjust our leverage from time to time. We leverage up, we deleverage. We -- if we have something like this $500 million, 28 note, that's expensive, we repay it, we replace it with cheaper leverage. So we're always doing that. And in the future, if necessary, we'll fund dividends and any other payments necessary to our security holders. Now that's the operational business. That business is made possible by our bitcoin reserves. We have 252,220 bitcoin. What's special? It's permanent capital. It can't be called -- it's not overnight deposits. We can lean on the capital. We can leverage it. We know that we can take out a four-year debt instrument and know that we'll have the capital in four years. And then the person that's buying the security knows we have the capital. So our reserves establish the creditworthiness of the company. What else do they do? Well, we create leverage with our reserves by mixing fixed income and equity together. Whenever we sell equity at a premium to the underlying net asset value, we create leverage. Whenever we sell debt, we create leverage. If we sell convertible or create conversion rights at a large premium, we create leverage. As the duration of our instruments stretch out, stretches out, we create leverage. So our reserves have some intelligent leverage in them. They're worth about $18 billion right now. We are the largest holder of permanent bitcoin capital. Now what can we do with it? Well, if we look to the right side, there's a lot -- the market wants to buy securities. So for example, one security they really like, that everybody understands, is a spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, FBTC, et cetera. There's like 42 of them right now. There are going to be spot ETFs in every country on earth. They meet compliance requirements, custody requirements, and they provide you with 1x leverage. If bitcoin doubles, you'll mostly double. If bitcoin is cut in half, you'll probably lose half your capital. They charge your fees of 20, 25 basis points. They are kind of like the institutional banks in the business. They're trust companies and they take overnight deposits and they're very limited in what they can do. You give them a million dollars, they can buy Bitcoin. You ask for the million dollars back. They give you the million dollars back. That's what they do. They don't have permanent deposits. They can't hold your money for a decade. They have very, very simple daily redemption windows. And so they never trade at a premium. They won't trade at a discount. And that means that they look pretty much like bitcoin. Their volatility looks like bitcoin. If bitcoin's 50 vol, they'll be 50 vol. Their performance will look like bitcoin. If bitcoin is 50 ARR, they'll look like 50 ARR. It's a great product for people that want to buy the spot commodity and they want it in a wrapper as a security. And I have no doubt in time it'll be very common that people use this instrument. That's a direct connection. Now, if you think about MicroStrategy, MicroStrategy offers something slightly more, less risky, less volatile than that. That's my MSTR convert. When we sell a convertible bond, if the price of Bitcoin is 70,000, and if we were to sell the convertible bond or say when the price of bitcoin, in fact, by definition, every single convertible bond we've ever sold was at the high of bitcoin, right? We're selling convertible bonds at the market. People are either buying the bitcoin or they're buying the bond. And if you wanted bitcoin long exposure, you buy the bond. You get a conversion right to our stock. And then if bitcoin trades down by 50%, you'll be able to put the bond back or you'll get redeemed at par. So those converts are part of our fixed income strategy. They give you some portion of bitcoin performance because they have the MSTR conversion rate. Now, we don't really know exactly how they will perform against bitcoin. I just showed you. In the past, we've outperformed bitcoin with the converts. But I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know what it'll do in the future. But common sense says that if we sell a convertible bond at a 40% or 50% premium to our stock, then when bitcoin doubles and doubles again, then you're getting a decent fraction of the bitcoin performance, and maybe you'll get more, maybe you'll get slightly less, but you're getting it in a bond instrument. That's in the market right now. And that creates a lot of leverage. And one of the results is MSTR equity outperforms bitcoin. That's a 1.5x or more. Historically, we're almost 2x leverage, but I mean, it changes every day. Our goal right, with the equity is use intelligent leverage to outperform bitcoin in the way that we outperform is on the upside. We have to have some leverage on the downside. And what we're doing is we're stripping the volatility, stripping the risk, stripping some of the performance out of the fixed income instrument, and then that benefit accrues to the equity holder. And so you see MicroStrategy straddling both sides of the spot market. Now, because we straddle both sides, that MSTR equity that trades one and a half times the performance of bitcoin, it happens to be 1.5 is volatile. So if Bitcoin's 50 vol, we're 75 or 80 vol, if Bitcoin's 50 ARR, we might be 75 or 80 ARR, right? So who wants that? Well, the derivative traders want it. So if you look at these derivatives like MSTX and MSTU, in a matter of weeks they raise more than a billion dollars of capital by offering the proposition of two times MSTR. But if you think about my chart, what they're really offering is If MSTR is 1.5, they're offering 3. If we're 2x, they're offering 4. So they're offering leverage to people that want that leverage and they're long bitcoin investors. I showed you how MicroStrategy has a large options market. Well, there are a lot of people that want 5x or 10x leverage. And the best way to get it, in their view, is a high volatility equity with deep liquidity. And I showed you how MicroStrategy is very liquid in the spot and very volatile. And so if you're volatile and you're liquid, then the only other question is, are you credible? Are you trustworthy or transparent? What are we going to do? And the thing about MicroStrategy is every day for the past four years, we've said one thing, bitcoin, long bitcoin, we're going to acquire Bitcoin. So if you're a trader and you're trying to figure out what's MicroStrategy's strategy, you don't have to worry, we're going to hedge. You don't have to worry. We're going to trade against you. We're long bitcoin. We're going to be 1.5x bitcoin. And that means you can create MSTX or MSTU. That means you can create MSTY. It means you can create an options market. It means that if you want to short bitcoin, then we're giving you extra juice to short it. If you want to go long, we go that way. And so you can see, of course, those three securities above the baseline offer high volatility, high leverage, and they're built on a bitcoin treasury company that has a large pool of permanent capital and has an adept treasury operation. If we look below the baseline, we've announced that we're going to pursue a target of $21 billion in fixed income, capital raise. Well, so convertible bonds are an obvious thing for us to do. We also look at other types of fixed income. And in the future, we could imagine preferred stocks that might be compelling to people that want some of the performance of bitcoin, but they want downside protection. Some people would like a convertible preferred, others might want a dividend of some sort. And then there's always the market for just providing fixed income, just a straight fixed coupon. If bitcoin -- I've said before, bitcoin returns 50% ARR. But there's a large portion of the world that would be happy if we stripped away 80% of the performance, 90% or 95% of the volatility, a lot of the risk. And if we stripped away risk and volatility and performance and we gave them a coupon that was compelling and an instrument that they felt good about the credit of, if they understood the balance sheet, then we would be providing a useful product to the market based upon a digital commodity. Everybody knows they want income. Everybody knows they want appreciation. Everybody would like to have it with varying degrees of risk and volatility. MicroStrategy treasury operations are to -- we assess the capital market, we figure out what the capital markets want. We figure out what's the best way. What is the security we might issue that's beneficial to all our other stakeholders? And of course, that changes from time-to-time. And we don't have any specific plan today. And so you'll just have to stay tuned. But this chart helps you understand that MicroStrategy is the sum of its bitcoin reserves and its treasury operations. And they go hand-in-hand in a very complementary, synergistic fashion. Shirish, next slide. I wanted to show this chart because people -- a lot of people have said, well, so what are you really doing. Is there historical precedent for this? And the answer is yes. If you think about the energy industry, if you think about standard oil or oil refining companies, what is an oil refining company doing? It is starting with a commodity, crude oil, crude oil that has a lot of energy in it. Bitcoin has a lot of energy in it. Bitcoin is crude capital. Standard oil discovered crude oil. The demand for that and the market is driven by technology. The supply is a function of technology, entropy, chaos, inflation. And everybody wants -- they want that energy because they want power or they want mobility or they want to drive human progress. And those oil companies are a $10 trillion asset class. So it's a big market, it's a global market. It's based on a commodity. Now, what do oil companies do? Well, they have oil reserves. They have proven reserves and unproven reserves. You would never value an oil company just on their reserves. It's like, oh, well, they're just 50% or they're 1.5 times their reserves. Well, the answer is, what else are they doing? Well, they have an oil refining operation. So what does an oil company do? I mean, it refines the petrochemicals into products that are either more refined or less refined. So if you ranked the top seven products that come from the crude oil commodity, the most refined is jet fuel. You're going to put it in your jet, fly across the Atlantic. It's pretty important. You'll pay a lot of money for jet fuel. Gasoline is the next most refined. Diesel is another product. Liquefied petroleum gas, LPG is another product, then heating oil, then fuel oil and then you get down to asphalt. We put it on the street. Now, none of these users can use the crude oil. You can't put crude oil in your car engine. You can't put crude oil down on the pavement for a highway. You can't put crude oil in your Boeing jet. So it's pretty obvious why you need an oil refining operation. And what does the company do? Well, it refines the petrochemicals, it prospects and drills, it extracts, it transports, and it manages the sales and distribution. And what is the company worth? It's worth the combination of those two things, right? And you have to figure out how valuable each of the two things are. But you are adding value to the crude oil when you refine it and purify it. When we create securities from bitcoin, we're adding value. We're creating something which someone with a large pool of capital finds very compelling. They can't use. They can't put the commodity in their engine, right? They just can't. They need the security and we give it to them in a refined format. And that's worth a lot of money to them. And because of that, there oftentimes is what I'll call a BTC spread. There's a difference between the value of that security to the investor and the amount of bitcoin in that security. And so in that particular case, if the BTC spread is 50%, then we sell $100 million of a security backed by 50 million of bitcoin and we capture $50 million in a BTC gain. And that is the value that we create for our shareholders. That BTC gain is reflected in the BTC yield that we show you. Next slide. MicroStrategy started, just thinking we were going to hold bitcoin on our balance sheet so we wouldn't bleed capital. Then we became opportunistic. Then we became strategic. And somewhere along the way we realized that the capital markets around the world will benefit and are undergoing a digital transformation. We are able to create and issue securities that provide everybody with the right amount of bitcoin performance and volatility in the security that they need. And so, and we can do it because we have this bitcoin backed reserve and bitcoin treasury operation. So if you think about our equity, what kind of investor would buy it? Well, someone that buys magnificent seven stocks, a bitcoin investor, a bitcoin maximalist that likes bitcoin might buy our equity because they want more bitcoin options traders. They would -- they don't directly buy our equity, but the options traders trade the options which then end up getting hedged into our equity. So the options are built on the equity, so indirectly they are using the equity and any other kind of derivatives like the MSTUs or MSTX or MSTYs I referred to. So we're actually digitally transforming those markets. The reason MicroStrategy equity is exploding in trading volume is because the market likes a security backed by digital capital. The reason that the options markets are exploding in open interest is the market likes to trade something backed by digital capital, right? If we look at another set of investors, there's equity indexes, they buy QQQ or SPY, there's hedge funds, there's arbitrageurs, there's alternative investors. They're looking for something which is not correlated to Traditional risk assets and maybe they want it for capital gain. And when we sell a convertible bond, we're actually offering somebody something that has downside protection. It's not correlated to their other portfolio. Maybe they get some bitcoin upside. It's a different thing for a different type of investor. But these are large markets. And just like -- those 15 of the 20 most successful ETFs this year, they're Bitcoin or MicroStrategy backed ETFs, right? What's going on there? The market's telling you that they love the vol, they love the performance and they love the idea of -- I mean who wouldn't love the idea of a big tech global network that feels like Google or Apple but 10 years early but isn't attached to a company, right? Like, it's the big tech monetary network, a different thing. So there are certain investors that won't like the equity because they just don't like the volatility and they don't like the risk. But they'll like sort of a part equity, part bond instrument like our converts. Then there's a third class of investors, the ones that buy preferred stock or high yield or private credit or real estate or hedge funds or alternatives. And it's not a market that we've served before. And as I said, we don't have any particular announcement right now, but it occurs to us that we're in an ideal position as a bitcoin treasury company to take this bitcoin high performance, high volatility capital and then strip away, strip a dividend out of it or strip away some of the volatility and performance and provide people with bitcoin with guardrails or bitcoin with downside protection or bitcoin low volatility, maybe with some kind of dividend of sorts. And of course the last market here is the very conventional market. They buy corporate debt, they buy real estate, they buy mortgage backed securities, they buy structured products, they buy preferred stocks and they're looking for like a fixed coupon and like we've generated fixed coupons. We just had a $500 million note and it was paying 6.25% interest and it was like 5, 10x over collateralized. It was like the most secure thing in the world. It was in $500 million at the base of $25, $30 billion tower of other assets. So, I don't think we minded so much paying the 6%. What we minded was we didn't want the EBITDA covenants, the liens, all of the other prohibitions, all of the other encumbrances and we didn't want to have all our bitcoin encumbered. But I could imagine under other circumstances that we'd be happy to pay a coupon that's compelling if we found the right security. So you can see MicroStrategy. I think we're transforming and expanding all the markets we enter. We're the first company that ever did a convertible bond one week and another one the next week. And as Andrew said, we're the most common issuer, the biggest issuer this year in terms of frequency. So we think that bitcoin is actually providing and revitalizing, injecting performance into options, into equity, into convertible bonds. We think it'll expand the markets, we think we can expand all these markets. We think ultimately it's going to be good for investors. It's going to be good for our common stock shareholders. There's really nobody's really losing because as I've said before, it's like bitcoin is giving us 50 vol, 50 ARR. And the world's full of people that would be delighted to take 20 vol, 20 ARR. And if we gave it to them over a long enough timeframe, it looks like -- it's like a 60% BTC spread product where $100 million of capital results in $60 million of BTC gains for our shareholders. And it still results in a very compelling instrument that's very easy to understand for a new class of investors. So we're excited about the opportunities and we've got a three-year plan. As I said, don't have a crystal ball. I don't know where we'll go with this, but over the next three years we'll explore this mix and we'll find the right combination for the capital markets for bitcoin and for our common stock shareholders. Next, we're really excited to increase our targets for BTC yield. We took them up by 2% from 4 to 8 to 6 to 10. But here is, I think, where it's appropriate for me just to make a few comments, right? Like as I said, I think our company's misunderstood and I also think it's undervalued. Investors have been concerned about a lot of things. They've been concerned about our ability to raise more capital via equity and debt issuance. I think as you can see from our performance so far and the 2121 plan, those concerns are unfounded. There's no reason that we have to stop issuing fixed income instruments. We're not encumbered by any EBITDA covenants or any particular other cash flow covenants that'll keep us from doing that. And as you could see, some people have asked, can you keep doing ATMs? And I think we put that to rest by filing a $21 billion ATM. We're going to expand and we're going to accelerate our treasury operations and our capital raising activities based upon the performance you've seen. And with our newfound insights, we just keep getting. We get new insights every single quarter in this market and we're learning. But as we learn, we get a bit more sophisticated in how we do this. Now I'm going to wade into the big premium debate here, like what's the appropriate premium for net asset against net asset value of MicroStrategy? And I just want to make one obvious point. We're a growth company. We're a bitcoin treasury company and we are growing. We are built on an asset, bitcoin, which is growing 50% a year and we are growing with that asset. If you review the market for common multiples of growth companies, if you had a 20% growth company, oftentimes they're valued at 25 times 40, 25 to 40 PTE. If you have a 30% growth company, oftentimes they valued at 35 to 55 PTE. If you have a 40% growth company, they're valued at 45 to 70 sometimes. And a company growing 50% is oftentimes valued at 60 to 100x. And of course Bitcoin's growing 50%. We don't know what it'll do in the future. But my personal long term view is over 21 years bitcoin is going to grow 29% ARR. And looking backward, it's definitely been growing fast, 50% every year for four years. So, how do you think about the value of the BTC, the bitcoin treasury operations, right? Not the balance sheet, not the reserves, but what's the operation worth? And if you expect 30% to 50% growth for bitcoin, then it's not unreasonable to have a 30 to 50x multiple for that growth. And a 30x to 50x multiple means, if you were to look at this 6% to 10% target, 30 times 10 is a 300% premium to net asset value. 50 times 10 is a 500% premium. So you're talking about an operation that's 3 to 5 net asset value. And if you tack on the actual treasury, you go from there and you realize you're talking about an enterprise that could be $80 billion to $100 billion. And you could establish it just by looking at this and realizing it. These are not U.S. T bills that we're holding on our balance sheet. If you had a U.S. treasury bill that was growing 0% a year, you would multiply it times 20 in order to get a right multiple. But bitcoin's growing more than 0% a year, so 20x is probably conservative. So that's one way to approach it. Another way to approach it is look at the BTC gain. And that is what's really happening here. When we have a 5% BTC yield in the quarter, that's the same as acquiring 12,500 bitcoin for our shareholders without dilution, that's like 50,000 bitcoin on an annualized basis, that's like a $3.6 billion annualized BTC gain. If you had a $3.6 billion annualized gain and you put a 30 to 50 multiple on it, you've all of a sudden got an operation that's got a $108 billion to $180 billion value. And then you tack on the other 18 billion for the bitcoin and you see where you get. It's like the operation 6 to 10 times net asset value, plus the reserves. And so, most of the market doesn't understand it and most of the debate has been this assumption that we're somehow some holding company that just got lucky and occasionally sell some equity. And we're not adding any value to the market. But hopefully, if you look at these numbers I've shown you, you realize that the value we're adding to the market is to create high performance, high volatility securities for one group of investors, and do that based on our unique structure and provide low volatility, lower performance, lower risk securities for another set of investors. And in that regard, we are the leader. Nobody else has $18 billion of permanent capital. In order to create a company like ours, you're going to have to actually go 100% all Bitcoin, and how do you do that at our scale? If you do it with, if you do it with a big tech company, they'll never be 100% Bitcoin, because they got too much other stuff in their enterprise. And if you do it with $1 billion company they're not going to catch us, because as you could see, we're not slowing down. We're actually going, we're going to target $10 billion of capital next year. So unless you're going to target $42 billion of capital in the next three years, then MicroStrategy is kind of in a unique position. So if you start thinking about like that, and I'll just leave one other thought with you, which is if you. And again, like, I don't have a crystal ball, there's risk in all of this. But you understand our 21/21 Plan, if we achieve our 21/21 Plan, if Bitcoin grows in excess of 21%, if that happens, MicroStrategy is capable of BTC gains, in excess of $10 billion a year within four years. And so, thinking about a business like that that's growing more than 20%, starts to put in perspective that yes, we shouldn't just be valued based on our Bitcoin reserves. The real issue, is what are the opportunities for us as a Bitcoin treasury company. And so with that, we can go to the next slide. Shirish, Phong said it, but I'll say it again. The world's largest ATM equity offering is to buy Bitcoin. And you could look at it and say, oh yes, great, I get it. But do you really get it? Here's the big idea. The reason that this is the largest ATM equity offering and it is to buy Bitcoin, is because any other company that announced a $21 billion ATM would be expected to invest the capital in something dilutive. If you sold $21 billion of equity and you bought T-Bills, you would be losing $2 billion a year, guaranteed. That's an awful idea. If you sold $21 billion of equity, and you went and bought another company, it's a risky acquisition. It'll take three to five years. I can tell you, as a public company, CEO for 30 years of my life, well, from 98 all the way to 2022, 24 years, I can tell you that 90% to 95% of acquisitions all failed dismally. Just a couple of percent ever really worked. So issuing this equity, to do an acquisition is very risky. And so, then what are you going to do? You're going to buy up real estate, build a building for five years? Are you going to build a new product? Are you going to hire 10,000 people? The problem in the market is most people don't have a good use of proceeds. Bitcoin is the best use of proceeds, maybe in the history of the capital markets. We're building, in essence a digital building in five days. We could raise $500 million, buy Bitcoin with it, show that there's a BTC yield, announce it a few days later, and then build another $500 million building. And all along the way, our shareholders have complete transparency into the credit, complete transparency into the risk. And we've got a metric that at a glance tells you, whether it's a creative or dilutive, and whether or not we're getting more efficient, right. Is the BTC spread improving to the benefit of the shareholders, or is it degrading? So we're very straightforward, very transparent. And because we have a balance sheet positively polarized toward capital, and we have a transparent, accretive use of capital. And because it's a high speed investment cycle, it's five days instead of five years. This makes total sense for our investors. In fact, I can tell you, and I've met with a lot of our investors, their number one concern isn't are you going to dilute us or issue more equity? Their number one concern has been all along. You're not going to stop, are you? Do you have to stop? Because we don't want you to stop. So, this is actually addressing concerns, and the needs of, and the benefits that accrue to our MSTR common stock shareholders. And I think it just illustrates the strength of our overall treasury strategy, and the strength of the Bitcoin market. Next slide. Okay. You've been troopers, you've stayed with me the entire time. I appreciate your attention, and I want to end with these principles. And I think they're very important, because if you're a MicroStrategy shareholder, you're coming with us on this journey, and hopefully you see that we're in this for the long-term, and we want to be as transparent and consistent, and reliable and understandable as we can possibly be to you. So these are our Bitcoin treasury company BTC principles. One, we are going to buy and hold Bitcoin indefinitely, exclusively, securely, right? The company is built on this idea. If you're waiting for us to hedge, to sell it, to get out on top, if you're looking for us to diversify, go elsewhere, right? If you're a banker pitching me the idea of buying a value stock, buy some other cash cow company with my stock. So that I can get them on the Bitcoin standard, my answer is what, are you going to offer me that's better than 29% ARR risk free for the next 21 years, right. We are focused on Bitcoin long-term, long hot time horizon. So that's the number one principle. It's very important. Everything else is built on it. Number two principle, we're going to prioritize MicroStrategy common stock shareholders for - long-term. And we're going to prioritize long-term value creation. If you own MSTR, you're my partner. You and I are in it together. When I meet with the MSTR shareholders, we talk about their ideas. They say you should do an ATM. Well, how much leverage should we take on, what should we be willing to do or not do? How do you feel about this, right? And their interests are my interest, they are the management team's interest. And if there's any question in your mind, like what do, you want to own for maximum performance over the next decade or 20 years, right. The way we keep score is MSTR performance. Number three, treat all investors with respect, consistency and transparency. Note, every investor is our respected counterparty. If you've got a call option on MicroStrategy that expires in 30 days, I respect you. I'm glad you do business with us. We appreciate the support, right. But we're not going to run the business in order to maximize the call option on day 29, if the call option expires out of the money. I'm sorry, I couldn't do anything about that. We're going to optimize for the long-term common stock, because otherwise nobody can do anything else. All of the other securities above and below the common stock wouldn't work. So, if you want to short us, have at it. I respect that too. By all means, more the merrier, because you're short $1 billion. You're going to buy $1 billion when we need you to buy it. And so it's fine. But of course, don't make the mistake of thinking that I'm going to serve your interest either, right. Our interests are to make sure that we make good on our obligations. If we make a promise, we will meet our promise to our creditors, to everybody else. And that just means be consistent, be transparent, be respectful. And I want people to know they can trust us to do what we said we're going to do. I expect that we will have lots of different types of investors with lots of different strategies. In fact, there's already almost infinite number of strategies. Long, short, hedged, people trading vol, people selling vol, people levering up. It's like it's impossible to figure them out. Just be clear that, we're going to think about one and two and then I don't try to out think the quants with the Bloomberg. I know they are smarter and faster, and they have an opinion. Let them do what they're going to do. All I want to say is, we're going to do our best not to compete with you. We're going to let you do your thing, we're going to respect you. And whatever we say we're going to do, we're going to do. Four, structure MSTR to outperform BTC. No offense to BTC I love BTC. I tweet about BTC every day of my life. But MicroStrategy stock is going to be intelligently levered, and our goal is to be more than BTC more volatile, higher performance. I'd be happy if we're 1.5. If you told me we were 2, I'm like pleasantly surprised and I love it. But we can't guarantee what that number will be. We can't even guarantee we will. But what I can tell you is our principle, is we will structure the business so rationally, everything we've done is with the aim of MicroStrategy being like a 1.5x BTC. We want a comfortable, responsible boost so that we can support everybody else in the market. Number five, we're going to acquire BTC continually. We'll just, we're going to keep stacking. And the way that we're going to stack, is while pursuing positive BTC yield. Look I mean, we could sell the stock, at a negative premium and add BTC, but it would be dilutive to the shareholders. There are a lot of times when we could - you know, we could raise capital and it's actually quite accretive, but it's not as a. But we don't like the spreads, and it looks worse than we think they'll be like next week. And so, we'll just hold out and wait, because we want to support the market and we just don't think it's appropriate. So, we have the ability to move aggressively when the opportunity presents itself, and we have the ability to wait and do nothing when that's the right thing to do. But you can invest in 500 other companies, and 500 other companies can make 10,000 capital investments. And after they make them, you can talk to the management team and try to figure out, was that building profitable, was that acquisition profitable? Should we have done that with shareholder money? Was that a good idea or not? And to tell you the truth, you could write 100,000 pages on that. And sometimes you never really know. And I think the thing that's special about MicroStrategy, which is really nice, is we're giving you the true north BTC yield. We're telling you every time we look at a deal, you know, somebody calls me and says, hi, you should do this and this and I calculate it. I calculate the BTC yield. I say well, that's not the most compelling option. Our shareholders won't respect me. We will publish it. We will be transparent. And so BTC yield really simplifies things a lot. It's like - I said, you want to make the investment in five days, and you want to know whether it was accretive for your shareholders. And then, if you're really honest and truthful and transparent, you tell them. And that's what we do. We're very proud of the fact that we tell you exactly, what we're going to do and we'll report on ourself. And some quarters are better BTC yield than others. Some deals have a greater BTC yield than others, and so understand it. And we're going to be pursuing it, because at the end of the day, we generate BTC yield, we generate BTC gain. We generate BTC gain, we put value in the Bitcoin operation, and that's the motor that drives the common stock and it drives Bitcoin. Six, our sixth principle is we're going to grow rapidly, but responsibly. And of course we're going to do it subject to market dynamics. The market changes every week, sometimes every day. We're paying attention. I can't tell you what we're going to do, because the thing that makes sense when the market is in one dynamic state, all of a sudden doesn't make sense three days later. But what you can be sure is we're going to pursue growth, and we're going to do it in a responsible fashion. Our seventh principle, we're going to issue innovative fixed income securities that are backed by Bitcoin, right? I just showed you those convertible bonds. That's a great secret, but it's pretty extraordinary. How do you buy Bitcoin with less volatility, less risk, and get Bitcoin returns? Pretty neat idea. There are other good ideas. There are other ideas that we think will appeal to people in the capital market. Some of them will appeal to Bitcoin investors. Some will appeal to crypto enthusiasts, some will appeal to conventional investors. We're going to stay in our lane. Our lane is we have a Bitcoin treasury reserve and its permanent capital. And that means that we can find innovative fixed income ideas. Why do I single out fixed income? Because fixed income, is what creates the most leverage that drives MSTR common. And when we do it, when we do fixed income correctly, we're going to generate that 1.5x or 2x Bitcoin return. And that makes everybody happy. And that leads me to eight, right? If you're going to do seven, you got to think eight. Eight is maintain a healthy, robust, pristine balance sheet. Now people are going to say, well, what does pristine mean? Well, it means transparent. It means homogeneous. There is one risk you take when you invest in MicroStrategy. There's a risk you take when you buy our fixed income securities. The risk, the obvious overarching risk, is you take Bitcoin risk, right? You're accepting the risk that Bitcoin itself could fail. And if you're not willing to accept a Bitcoin existential systemic risk, then you probably shouldn't own any of our securities, right? Because we're a Bitcoin company. But once you've accepted Bitcoin risk, there's a lot of people in the world, a lot of investors, they'll say to me, Mike, I love Bitcoin, I believe in Bitcoin, I just can't stand the volatility. Or I believe in Bitcoin, but I need like a guaranteed coupon. Or I believe in Bitcoin, but I can't be marking this to market in my strategy, or my strategy doesn't let me do this. So there are a lot of people that will accept that. But after that, they want to know that we're going to execute responsibly. So that means we want a straightforward balance sheet. We want you to understand it. It's very, very straightforward. These are our assets, these are our liquid assets, right? We don't want to have complications. The reason we wanted to repay the 28, $500 million senior bond. Too many complications, too many caveats, too many, you know, too many restrictions, and what we've learned over the four years, is when we have complications in the balance sheet like the Silvergate loan, or like this 28 senior note. Those things undermine our ability to serve our common stock shareholders, and they undermine our ability to issue converts. And they undermine our ability to serve Bitcoin, and to do the right thing for the capital market. So, we are enthusiastic, but we're also very disciplined. And we know that we need to be viewed, as having a pristine balance sheet in the Bitcoin business, in the Bitcoin treasury business. And so that's why we value that. And then nine, and I'll end with this. We're going to promote global adoption of BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Promote it to countries, promote it to cities, promote it to states, promote it to companies, to public companies, promote it to private companies. I speak with public company executives. I speak with private company executives. We sponsor Bitcoin for corporations. Our belief - is that Bitcoin is a solution to the problem that 95% of public companies have, and I guess 99% of private companies have, which is they don't have healthy balance sheets. Bitcoin fixes the balance sheet. It'll bring your stock back to life. It'll bring your options back to life. It'll bring volatility. Everybody is negatively polarized to capital. We want to flip the switch and positively polarize them to capital. So unlike a lot of industries where you don't want competitors in our business, we're happy to share the playbook. We're happy to advocate. We'll show you how to do it. Everybody can win. There are no losers on the Bitcoin standard. There are only varying degrees of winners. And so with that, I would like to thank everybody for your time and I guess, Shirish, let's go to questions.\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Great. Thank you so much, Michael. That was a fantastic session. And we went way over our assigned time of one hour. However, what we'll do is we'll take two quick questions. So, by the way, thank you to all the viewers. There were 4,000 people who joined in and there are hundreds of questions that we received. So we'll just take two questions in the interest of time. And the first question is for Andrew. Andrew, can you please provide a framework around how you might cover interest expense, if we continue to issue convertible or fixed income notes that might be beyond servicing, that might be beyond servicing from the software cash flows?\nAndrew Kang: Sure. Thanks for the question. In the near term, I guess I'd say, I mentioned earlier, we redeemed the 28 notes, which was our highest cost debt, and by doing so, we reduced our annual cost by about $30 million, or about 50% of our debt load. So that obviously frees up cash in the near term taking out the 28s also release this from all the covenants. So there may be some opportunities to get accretive there. And lastly, but probably more importantly, the 21/21 Plan, we plan to raise, $42 billion of capital and that capital could be used to service interest if needed. So overall, I think, we feel pretty good about our ability to issue new debt, issue new fixed income securities and we'll look forward to those opportunities in the future.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. And we'll take one question for Michael. Given your ambitious ATM plan, are you concerned about the controlled company status, and how do you view it in the long-term?\nMichael Saylor: I have slightly more than 50% of the voting stock right now. And as we raise additional capital, I expect that my voting interest will slip below into the high 40s. If we raise a lot of capital, it might slip into, move into the mid-40s or the low-40s, but I'm not at all concerned about it. First of all, we're going to run this company in partnership with our common stock shareholders. And I meet with them routinely. There's nothing that we are going to do that they're not going to want us to do. And so, so, perhaps in order to get over 50%, I might have two or three of them join with me on occasion. But I actually look forward to that. So I think our common stock shareholders should know that they're our partners, and they deserve a say in the company. They'll have a greater say in the company and that's fine. I don't really think there's - any reason that our company can't operate just fine with me having 48% of the vote instead of 52% of the vote. As you can see our principles, you can see our plan. I think that substantially I'll have enough voting shares, to ensure that the company stays on track, but I'm not at all concerned about, issuing additional equity.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. I think with that, we will conclude the Q&A portion of the webinar. And I will hand the call over to Phong for the final closing remarks.\nPhong Le: Look, I want to thank the several thousands of you who attended our earnings call today. I understand it's an elongated session, and I appreciate your support and hopefully you've seen from our remarks, we are quite enthusiastic about the future of Bitcoin, and the future of MicroStrategy, and the potential for value creation for all of our shareholders. We believe that the Bitcoin treasury company strategy and the enterprise software strategy, is going to create growth and value. So we wish everybody a good quarter, a happy holidays, and we look forward to seeing all of you again in 12 weeks. Thank you all.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. I'm delighted to see you all on the call today. Thank you for joining us. And for all of our shareholders, thank you for your support. I was really excited about this call, because this is the chance to share our strategy and our vision looking out over the next three years. And we're going to be doing it, more detailed than we have in the past. So Shirish, go ahead to the next slide. I don't have to remind anybody that we're still in the early stage of adoption of Bitcoin as Digital Capital. 2024 has been a great year. The launch of the ETFs at the beginning of the year, was a major milestone. The embrace of Bitcoin by major political parties is a second milestone. I think we can see movement toward normalization of Bitcoin. The approval of options trading that's moving through the pipeline for the ETFs is a big deal. The movements toward banks beginning to custody Bitcoin, is very exciting. A lot of companies adopted fair value accounting this year. That's another exciting milestone. And of course, anybody that's been paying attention to the flows into the Bitcoin ETFs have noticed, that they've been picking up over the past few weeks. And it's generally acknowledged that these Bitcoin Spot ETFs, are the most successful ETFs ever launched. And so, while we're early, it's very promising. Bitcoin's about a $1.4 trillion asset class. And as you can see, Bitcoin is gradually going to draw capital from equities, from real estate, from bonds, from currency derivatives, and of course from gold. We can go to the next slide. This is a -- it's a very powerful slide, because it tells the story of investing in finance over the past four years. Since MicroStrategy adopted the Bitcoin standard in August 10th of 2020, bonds are down 5% a year. As you'll recall, we had $500 million of our treasury in bonds, substantially all of it. So we were invested in the far right side of this curve and we saw it as being a dead end and we needed to find something else. And you can see since that time, there has been an expansion of the money supply. Probably the best surrogate for that expansion is the S&P 500. And you can see the SP 500 is up 14%. 14% is effectively the traditional cost of capital for 20th century assets, for financial assets, for physical assets. If you're getting less than 14%, you're losing wealth, you're losing purchasing power, and you're not meeting the cost of capital in the mainstream. If you're ahead of 14%, then you're accreting power. And so, you can see what's happening is gold can't keep up, bonds don't work, real estate is trying to keep up, but it doesn't. The Magnificent Seven are doing double. The great companies, the Apples, the Amazons, the Googles, the Facebooks, they're actually outstripping the S&P. And of course, as they outstrip the S&P, most of the other companies in the S&P are falling behind. Bitcoin has far outstripped the Magnificent Seven. If you've been following our journey, you know that our thesis was bitcoin is like the Facebook of money or the Google of money. It is the dominant digital monetary network. It's a network that everybody in the world needs. Nobody in the world can stop. And most conventional investors don't understand. That has always been the thesis. Bitcoin is proving that it is incredible. It is the strongest asset. MicroStrategy threw its lot in with bitcoin, but I'm happy to say here today that not only has MicroStrategy managed to become 100% bitcoin, we've managed to almost 2x the performance of bitcoin. And we've done it through taking advantage of our unique opportunities and our unique capabilities as an operating company to assume intelligent leverage, to sell volatility and to manage our balance sheet. So this is just a -- it's a great outcome. Shall we go to the next slide? Not only is MicroStrategy outperforming asset classes, it turns out that MicroStrategy has outperformed all 500 of the S&P 500. So we looked at everybody. We even looked at companies that weren't in the S&P 500 on August 10, like Tesla, like Super Microsoft. And MicroStrategy is in essence, using a bitcoin strategy, come out of Nowhere to get 1989% growth in the equity value over this time period. And you can see it's not even close, right? I mean, we've dramatically outperformed Super Micro. We've dramatically outperformed Nvidia. And then when you get down to the number 5 or number 6 company, we're 4x. And so this is really a testament to the power of digital capital, if you understand it properly. Let's go to the next slide. We're a very special company in a lot of ways now. You can compare us to bitcoin. If you're comparing MicroStrategy to holding a diversified portfolio of the S&P and Nasdaq, you can see we're far outperforming. I mean, this chart really is showing that the bitcoin is the winning asset class by far. Bitcoin is really compelling because not only is it beating all the other major asset classes, but in terms of assets that a publicly traded operating company could hold, an operating company could hold a small portion of securities. It could hold a lot of bonds, or it could hold bitcoin. And so you see, when you look at that chart, it's not even close. There's one good answer for a treasury reserve asset. There's one not good answer. And there's a lot of imperfect solutions that you can't easily hold because of a 40% limit on securities in your portfolio as an operating company. You can also see our performance against big tech stocks. And of course, they're all great companies. But at the end of the day, these companies haven't embraced digital capital. And so, of course, the winner, Nvidia, has embraced digital intelligence. But digital intelligence is not an easy strategy to copy. What I say often is, if you can copy Nvidia, go ahead, have at it. I don't think it's easy to copy. MicroStrategy, on the other hand, you can copy. It is easy to copy. We've been publishing the Playbook and we continue to do so enthusiastically. And so, MicroStrategy doesn't just represent a company that made a good investment at the right time. We really represent the beginning of a wave of digital transformation of capital. The capital markets are transforming. Bitcoin is digital capital. In time, dozens of companies will realize this, then hundreds, then thousands. Next slide. The conundrum for most companies is like 1% of the companies in the S&P 500 are generating most of the gain. 99% of the companies can't keep up. And so, the Magnificent Seven steal the show. Most companies underperform. Bitcoin is dramatically beating the Magnificent Seven. And your best hope to actually keep up with the Magnificent Seven is construct a bitcoin strategy. And of course, if it's a levered long strategy, you beat everybody, next slide. Now, here's an interesting insight that we haven't ever shown before in one of these calls. MicroStrategy is not just the number one performing stock out of the S&P 500. We're also the most volatile stock. And there's a conventional wisdom in finance, which is volatility is bad and you shouldn't take risk with your balance sheet. But we're turning that conventional wisdom on its head. When you basically invest all of your capital into treasuries, when you're on the UST standard, you're stripping the volatility down to a vol of five. Bitcoin is a volume of 50 or 55. When you strip to the vol of five, what it means is your returns are 10% weaker than the S&P index. You're generating 10% less than the cost of capital. So capital becomes toxic to the company when you actually eschew volatility and you eschew bitcoin. When you embrace volatility, then you're outperforming the S&P. And now the capital isn't toxic, the capital is healthy. So a company with a conventional strategy strips the volatility, embraces low risk treasuries, loses 10% of its capital every year. Its equity markets die. Its option markets become unhealthy. It becomes a sick company. Only they don't know they're sick because conventional wisdom says that's the right thing to do. And by the time they've stripped the volatility off their balance sheet and stripped the volatility off their P&L, they have damped their appeal to the capital markets. And then you ask the question, why do you even want to be a public company if you're not actually tapping into the capital markets in order to provide them with a public security that's interesting for them to buy, sell, trade, talk about hedge arbitrage, et cetera. So this volatility has a very interesting effect, and I'll show it on the next slide, Shirish? If you look at the top 10 performers in the S&P 500, and you consider options open interest, MicroStrategy is actually number seven. We're in the Top 10, even though we're much, much smaller than most of these companies, right? Obviously, we're not as big as a Walmart or Coca Cola or a McDonald's or any of the household names you've heard about your entire life. But of course, because we're high volatility, the options market wants to trade those options. So we jump into the Top 10 leaderboard because we have a high volatility balance sheet. If we look at daily trading volume and the Top 10, you can see MicroStrategy again jumps to number seven. We're in the Top 10 out of all the S&P 500 companies in daily trading volume. And it's a pretty extraordinary outcome given the fact that in some cases these companies are 100 times bigger than us. And of course, if you look at the impact of that volatility on a market cap weighted basis, if you compare open interest in the options market as a percentage of market cap for all 500 companies in the S&P 500, MicroStrategy is number one. We are the most optioned, optionable per weight or per market cap stock in this entire universe. And if you look at daily trading volume, the liquidity of the equity as a percentage of market cap, we are also number one. Another way to say it is MicroStrategy is the hottest stock in this universe, right? Volatility is vitality, as we say. What's interesting about this is I describe volatility as like RPM on an engine. And if you have RPM on a small paper straw and you spin it 50 times a minute, it's like a kid's toy. And then if you take that paper straw and you replace it with a five pound dumbbell and you spin it 50 times a minute, it's a weapon. Now, if you put some leverage on it, if you extend it by 50% more and it goes to 90 RPM, it gets quite scary. Now imagine what happens when you put $18 billion of capital into a balance sheet and you spin it 90 or a 100 RPM. You've got a turbine. You have a motor that will move an aircraft carrier, right? You can move a small city or light up a city with it. The conventional wisdom in the market is capital is toxic. Give it back to the shareholders, make it go away, dividend it out, buy the stock back, get rid of the money. And if you're going to keep the money, invest it in a five vol asset, which is like take your money, put it in the basement and lock the vault and then make sure it never moves. It's dead money. MicroStrategy's approach is to embrace the volatility, embrace an asset that is outperforming the S&P. And in that world, instead of being negatively polarized to capital, we are positively polarized to capital. The more capital that we gather, the more powerful we become and the more we enrich our own shareholders. This is -- it's totally counterintuitive because everybody else in the world thinks you sell equity, you dilute the shareholders. That's true. If you don't have a use of proceeds that grows faster and yields more than the S&P 500 index, the cost of capital is the S&P 500. If you want to be positively polarized to capital, you want two conditions. You want to be able to invest the capital in something that beats the S&P consistently. That's the first condition. It needs to have performance. The second condition is you want velocity. You'd like to invest the capital in five days, not five years. If you can invest the capital in five days and then you can show that it actually beat the S&P index, then you've actually got the Holy Grail. Now you've got a magnet which is attracting capital. And MicroStrategy has pioneered this by combining capital markets activity with bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. With the embrace of BTC yield and BCT yield shows that in fact we acquired the capital in a manner that was accretive to our shareholders as opposed to dilutive. And that means that when we're actually engaging in capital markets activity, we're doing it in an accretive high velocity fashion. That, of course, is what is driving this trading volume, what's driving this open interest. And of course, because we have the volatility, many of the things we do are actually selling the volatility, recycling the proceeds of the volatility back into bitcoin and then delivering that to our shareholders in the form of a BTC yield. Shall we go to the next slide? Now here's another slide that no one's ever seen before in one of our presentations, many of you know about MSTR stock. And what I've said is, oh, MSTR stock, it's beaten the S&P 500. And now some of you know about options. MSTR options are more traded pound for pound than anything else in the S&P 500. And so you know that we are the volatility winner. You know that we're liquidity winner. You know we're the performance winner. What you might not know is that MicroStrategy has sold six convertible bonds. And if you had bought any of them Europe 224%, 86%, 67%, 90%, 41% or 54%, they've all been successful. They've been some of the most successful bonds ever sold to the convertible bond market. They're extraordinary in that regard. But here's the real extraordinary aha. How do you buy bitcoin at the all-time high? Get the upside of bitcoin and get your principal protection and get the downside protected. How do you strip the volatility and the risk off of the investment and keep the performance? You can't do that with an ETF. You can't do it with a straight equity that's 100% upside, 100% downside. But if you look at the chart on the right and this is just, it'll just blew me away when I saw it. You realize bitcoin has delivered 47% performance since those bonds were sold. And our bonds delivered 90% performance. And what that means is if you had bought a million dollars of bitcoin on the day we sold the 25 convert, or a million dollars of the convert, or if you just across all of these, you bought a million dollars of each of them in the convert, you would have got a 90% return. And if you had bought a million dollars of bitcoin, you would have got a 47% return. So not only do you get the return of bitcoin, you also get the downside protection. And in this particular case, I'm kind of delighted to say we outperform bitcoin not with our equity, we outperform bitcoin with our bonds. Now people, they struggle with what is MicroStrategy's unique advantage in the market? What justifies the market capitalization of the company? Well, one very obvious thing is we are the primary, perhaps the major creator of or issuer of bitcoin backed bonds in the world. And we're able to do these at scale and we've got the credibility to issue them. We've got the know-how to issue them and we have the permanent capital, we have the $18 billion of permanent bitcoin and we have the large equity market cap that provides the floor that provides the credit for a bond buyer. And yet you couldn't really reproduce this performance. If you took $300 billion of cash in treasury bills and you sold these convertible bonds, well, you could guarantee that the buyer of the bond gets their money back. But you wouldn't be able to beat bitcoin performance. You would be lucky to be able to beat the U.S. treasury performance. And so if you're going to issue bitcoin backed bonds or convertible bonds like this, you need to be 100% bitcoin and it needs to be permanent capital. You need to know that you've got it and no one's going to call it away from you. So MicroStrategy has got a very exciting business here. This is right now the best understood part of our fixed income strategy. And it's not the only thing we can do. But what you can see is that we have very successfully executed this strategy to the benefit of the bondholders and of course, also to the benefit of the equity holders. Next slide. There's a lot of confusion in the market. I mean, MicroStrategy is misunderstood. It's a little bit underestimated. I think the company is undervalued. And it starts from this observation that MicroStrategy is just a holding company that has some bitcoin on its balance sheet that trades at a premium. And somehow people that are short the company, they want to work through this logic of maybe the company's just worth its net asset value and a little bit of a premium. But that's like saying a bank is only worth its net, it's book value of its capital or maybe, you know, Apple computer. 98.5% of Apple is based on forward expectations of the business, and only 1.5% is based upon the liquid assets of the company, so most companies are valued based upon their operations and their reserves. And so if we think about MicroStrategy as a bitcoin treasury company, what are we doing? Well, we are plugged into the macro economy. The macro economy is being driven by technology, by inflation, by entropy, by chaos. And that macro economy drives the crypto economy. The crypto economy trades 24x7, 365 and people move around all the crypto assets and they also trade back and forth bitcoin. And that's what makes it very volatile. That's why you can sell a billion dollars on Saturday night. That's why you can buy a billion dollars of it on Sunday morning, right? The crypto economy, or the crypto exchanges plugged into bitcoin, they are picking up the vibrations and the sentiments and the positive and negative developments of the macro economy. Now, why do people go to bitcoin? Capital preservation and productivity. And of course, they will continue to do that. And that's a $1.4 trillion asset class. Now, bitcoin is a commodity. It's a digital commodity. MicroStrategy taps into that digital commodity with our treasury operations. And one thing we do is acquire bitcoin. We acquire the bitcoin. We custody the bitcoin and we do that on behalf of our investors because many of them either can't or choose not to hold bitcoin and custody of the bitcoin. We also issue securities like our equity and like our convertible bonds. And we adjust our leverage from time to time. We leverage up, we deleverage. We -- if we have something like this $500 million, 28 note, that's expensive, we repay it, we replace it with cheaper leverage. So we're always doing that. And in the future, if necessary, we'll fund dividends and any other payments necessary to our security holders. Now that's the operational business. That business is made possible by our bitcoin reserves. We have 252,220 bitcoin. What's special? It's permanent capital. It can't be called -- it's not overnight deposits. We can lean on the capital. We can leverage it. We know that we can take out a four-year debt instrument and know that we'll have the capital in four years. And then the person that's buying the security knows we have the capital. So our reserves establish the creditworthiness of the company. What else do they do? Well, we create leverage with our reserves by mixing fixed income and equity together. Whenever we sell equity at a premium to the underlying net asset value, we create leverage. Whenever we sell debt, we create leverage. If we sell convertible or create conversion rights at a large premium, we create leverage. As the duration of our instruments stretch out, stretches out, we create leverage. So our reserves have some intelligent leverage in them. They're worth about $18 billion right now. We are the largest holder of permanent bitcoin capital. Now what can we do with it? Well, if we look to the right side, there's a lot -- the market wants to buy securities. So for example, one security they really like, that everybody understands, is a spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, FBTC, et cetera. There's like 42 of them right now. There are going to be spot ETFs in every country on earth. They meet compliance requirements, custody requirements, and they provide you with 1x leverage. If bitcoin doubles, you'll mostly double. If bitcoin is cut in half, you'll probably lose half your capital. They charge your fees of 20, 25 basis points. They are kind of like the institutional banks in the business. They're trust companies and they take overnight deposits and they're very limited in what they can do. You give them a million dollars, they can buy Bitcoin. You ask for the million dollars back. They give you the million dollars back. That's what they do. They don't have permanent deposits. They can't hold your money for a decade. They have very, very simple daily redemption windows. And so they never trade at a premium. They won't trade at a discount. And that means that they look pretty much like bitcoin. Their volatility looks like bitcoin. If bitcoin's 50 vol, they'll be 50 vol. Their performance will look like bitcoin. If bitcoin is 50 ARR, they'll look like 50 ARR. It's a great product for people that want to buy the spot commodity and they want it in a wrapper as a security. And I have no doubt in time it'll be very common that people use this instrument. That's a direct connection. Now, if you think about MicroStrategy, MicroStrategy offers something slightly more, less risky, less volatile than that. That's my MSTR convert. When we sell a convertible bond, if the price of Bitcoin is 70,000, and if we were to sell the convertible bond or say when the price of bitcoin, in fact, by definition, every single convertible bond we've ever sold was at the high of bitcoin, right? We're selling convertible bonds at the market. People are either buying the bitcoin or they're buying the bond. And if you wanted bitcoin long exposure, you buy the bond. You get a conversion right to our stock. And then if bitcoin trades down by 50%, you'll be able to put the bond back or you'll get redeemed at par. So those converts are part of our fixed income strategy. They give you some portion of bitcoin performance because they have the MSTR conversion rate. Now, we don't really know exactly how they will perform against bitcoin. I just showed you. In the past, we've outperformed bitcoin with the converts. But I don't have a crystal ball. I don't know what it'll do in the future. But common sense says that if we sell a convertible bond at a 40% or 50% premium to our stock, then when bitcoin doubles and doubles again, then you're getting a decent fraction of the bitcoin performance, and maybe you'll get more, maybe you'll get slightly less, but you're getting it in a bond instrument. That's in the market right now. And that creates a lot of leverage. And one of the results is MSTR equity outperforms bitcoin. That's a 1.5x or more. Historically, we're almost 2x leverage, but I mean, it changes every day. Our goal right, with the equity is use intelligent leverage to outperform bitcoin in the way that we outperform is on the upside. We have to have some leverage on the downside. And what we're doing is we're stripping the volatility, stripping the risk, stripping some of the performance out of the fixed income instrument, and then that benefit accrues to the equity holder. And so you see MicroStrategy straddling both sides of the spot market. Now, because we straddle both sides, that MSTR equity that trades one and a half times the performance of bitcoin, it happens to be 1.5 is volatile. So if Bitcoin's 50 vol, we're 75 or 80 vol, if Bitcoin's 50 ARR, we might be 75 or 80 ARR, right? So who wants that? Well, the derivative traders want it. So if you look at these derivatives like MSTX and MSTU, in a matter of weeks they raise more than a billion dollars of capital by offering the proposition of two times MSTR. But if you think about my chart, what they're really offering is If MSTR is 1.5, they're offering 3. If we're 2x, they're offering 4. So they're offering leverage to people that want that leverage and they're long bitcoin investors. I showed you how MicroStrategy has a large options market. Well, there are a lot of people that want 5x or 10x leverage. And the best way to get it, in their view, is a high volatility equity with deep liquidity. And I showed you how MicroStrategy is very liquid in the spot and very volatile. And so if you're volatile and you're liquid, then the only other question is, are you credible? Are you trustworthy or transparent? What are we going to do? And the thing about MicroStrategy is every day for the past four years, we've said one thing, bitcoin, long bitcoin, we're going to acquire Bitcoin. So if you're a trader and you're trying to figure out what's MicroStrategy's strategy, you don't have to worry, we're going to hedge. You don't have to worry. We're going to trade against you. We're long bitcoin. We're going to be 1.5x bitcoin. And that means you can create MSTX or MSTU. That means you can create MSTY. It means you can create an options market. It means that if you want to short bitcoin, then we're giving you extra juice to short it. If you want to go long, we go that way. And so you can see, of course, those three securities above the baseline offer high volatility, high leverage, and they're built on a bitcoin treasury company that has a large pool of permanent capital and has an adept treasury operation. If we look below the baseline, we've announced that we're going to pursue a target of $21 billion in fixed income, capital raise. Well, so convertible bonds are an obvious thing for us to do. We also look at other types of fixed income. And in the future, we could imagine preferred stocks that might be compelling to people that want some of the performance of bitcoin, but they want downside protection. Some people would like a convertible preferred, others might want a dividend of some sort. And then there's always the market for just providing fixed income, just a straight fixed coupon. If bitcoin -- I've said before, bitcoin returns 50% ARR. But there's a large portion of the world that would be happy if we stripped away 80% of the performance, 90% or 95% of the volatility, a lot of the risk. And if we stripped away risk and volatility and performance and we gave them a coupon that was compelling and an instrument that they felt good about the credit of, if they understood the balance sheet, then we would be providing a useful product to the market based upon a digital commodity. Everybody knows they want income. Everybody knows they want appreciation. Everybody would like to have it with varying degrees of risk and volatility. MicroStrategy treasury operations are to -- we assess the capital market, we figure out what the capital markets want. We figure out what's the best way. What is the security we might issue that's beneficial to all our other stakeholders? And of course, that changes from time-to-time. And we don't have any specific plan today. And so you'll just have to stay tuned. But this chart helps you understand that MicroStrategy is the sum of its bitcoin reserves and its treasury operations. And they go hand-in-hand in a very complementary, synergistic fashion. Shirish, next slide. I wanted to show this chart because people -- a lot of people have said, well, so what are you really doing. Is there historical precedent for this? And the answer is yes. If you think about the energy industry, if you think about standard oil or oil refining companies, what is an oil refining company doing? It is starting with a commodity, crude oil, crude oil that has a lot of energy in it. Bitcoin has a lot of energy in it. Bitcoin is crude capital. Standard oil discovered crude oil. The demand for that and the market is driven by technology. The supply is a function of technology, entropy, chaos, inflation. And everybody wants -- they want that energy because they want power or they want mobility or they want to drive human progress. And those oil companies are a $10 trillion asset class. So it's a big market, it's a global market. It's based on a commodity. Now, what do oil companies do? Well, they have oil reserves. They have proven reserves and unproven reserves. You would never value an oil company just on their reserves. It's like, oh, well, they're just 50% or they're 1.5 times their reserves. Well, the answer is, what else are they doing? Well, they have an oil refining operation. So what does an oil company do? I mean, it refines the petrochemicals into products that are either more refined or less refined. So if you ranked the top seven products that come from the crude oil commodity, the most refined is jet fuel. You're going to put it in your jet, fly across the Atlantic. It's pretty important. You'll pay a lot of money for jet fuel. Gasoline is the next most refined. Diesel is another product. Liquefied petroleum gas, LPG is another product, then heating oil, then fuel oil and then you get down to asphalt. We put it on the street. Now, none of these users can use the crude oil. You can't put crude oil in your car engine. You can't put crude oil down on the pavement for a highway. You can't put crude oil in your Boeing jet. So it's pretty obvious why you need an oil refining operation. And what does the company do? Well, it refines the petrochemicals, it prospects and drills, it extracts, it transports, and it manages the sales and distribution. And what is the company worth? It's worth the combination of those two things, right? And you have to figure out how valuable each of the two things are. But you are adding value to the crude oil when you refine it and purify it. When we create securities from bitcoin, we're adding value. We're creating something which someone with a large pool of capital finds very compelling. They can't use. They can't put the commodity in their engine, right? They just can't. They need the security and we give it to them in a refined format. And that's worth a lot of money to them. And because of that, there oftentimes is what I'll call a BTC spread. There's a difference between the value of that security to the investor and the amount of bitcoin in that security. And so in that particular case, if the BTC spread is 50%, then we sell $100 million of a security backed by 50 million of bitcoin and we capture $50 million in a BTC gain. And that is the value that we create for our shareholders. That BTC gain is reflected in the BTC yield that we show you. Next slide. MicroStrategy started, just thinking we were going to hold bitcoin on our balance sheet so we wouldn't bleed capital. Then we became opportunistic. Then we became strategic. And somewhere along the way we realized that the capital markets around the world will benefit and are undergoing a digital transformation. We are able to create and issue securities that provide everybody with the right amount of bitcoin performance and volatility in the security that they need. And so, and we can do it because we have this bitcoin backed reserve and bitcoin treasury operation. So if you think about our equity, what kind of investor would buy it? Well, someone that buys magnificent seven stocks, a bitcoin investor, a bitcoin maximalist that likes bitcoin might buy our equity because they want more bitcoin options traders. They would -- they don't directly buy our equity, but the options traders trade the options which then end up getting hedged into our equity. So the options are built on the equity, so indirectly they are using the equity and any other kind of derivatives like the MSTUs or MSTX or MSTYs I referred to. So we're actually digitally transforming those markets. The reason MicroStrategy equity is exploding in trading volume is because the market likes a security backed by digital capital. The reason that the options markets are exploding in open interest is the market likes to trade something backed by digital capital, right? If we look at another set of investors, there's equity indexes, they buy QQQ or SPY, there's hedge funds, there's arbitrageurs, there's alternative investors. They're looking for something which is not correlated to Traditional risk assets and maybe they want it for capital gain. And when we sell a convertible bond, we're actually offering somebody something that has downside protection. It's not correlated to their other portfolio. Maybe they get some bitcoin upside. It's a different thing for a different type of investor. But these are large markets. And just like -- those 15 of the 20 most successful ETFs this year, they're Bitcoin or MicroStrategy backed ETFs, right? What's going on there? The market's telling you that they love the vol, they love the performance and they love the idea of -- I mean who wouldn't love the idea of a big tech global network that feels like Google or Apple but 10 years early but isn't attached to a company, right? Like, it's the big tech monetary network, a different thing. So there are certain investors that won't like the equity because they just don't like the volatility and they don't like the risk. But they'll like sort of a part equity, part bond instrument like our converts. Then there's a third class of investors, the ones that buy preferred stock or high yield or private credit or real estate or hedge funds or alternatives. And it's not a market that we've served before. And as I said, we don't have any particular announcement right now, but it occurs to us that we're in an ideal position as a bitcoin treasury company to take this bitcoin high performance, high volatility capital and then strip away, strip a dividend out of it or strip away some of the volatility and performance and provide people with bitcoin with guardrails or bitcoin with downside protection or bitcoin low volatility, maybe with some kind of dividend of sorts. And of course the last market here is the very conventional market. They buy corporate debt, they buy real estate, they buy mortgage backed securities, they buy structured products, they buy preferred stocks and they're looking for like a fixed coupon and like we've generated fixed coupons. We just had a $500 million note and it was paying 6.25% interest and it was like 5, 10x over collateralized. It was like the most secure thing in the world. It was in $500 million at the base of $25, $30 billion tower of other assets. So, I don't think we minded so much paying the 6%. What we minded was we didn't want the EBITDA covenants, the liens, all of the other prohibitions, all of the other encumbrances and we didn't want to have all our bitcoin encumbered. But I could imagine under other circumstances that we'd be happy to pay a coupon that's compelling if we found the right security. So you can see MicroStrategy. I think we're transforming and expanding all the markets we enter. We're the first company that ever did a convertible bond one week and another one the next week. And as Andrew said, we're the most common issuer, the biggest issuer this year in terms of frequency. So we think that bitcoin is actually providing and revitalizing, injecting performance into options, into equity, into convertible bonds. We think it'll expand the markets, we think we can expand all these markets. We think ultimately it's going to be good for investors. It's going to be good for our common stock shareholders. There's really nobody's really losing because as I've said before, it's like bitcoin is giving us 50 vol, 50 ARR. And the world's full of people that would be delighted to take 20 vol, 20 ARR. And if we gave it to them over a long enough timeframe, it looks like -- it's like a 60% BTC spread product where $100 million of capital results in $60 million of BTC gains for our shareholders. And it still results in a very compelling instrument that's very easy to understand for a new class of investors. So we're excited about the opportunities and we've got a three-year plan. As I said, don't have a crystal ball. I don't know where we'll go with this, but over the next three years we'll explore this mix and we'll find the right combination for the capital markets for bitcoin and for our common stock shareholders. Next, we're really excited to increase our targets for BTC yield. We took them up by 2% from 4 to 8 to 6 to 10. But here is, I think, where it's appropriate for me just to make a few comments, right? Like as I said, I think our company's misunderstood and I also think it's undervalued. Investors have been concerned about a lot of things. They've been concerned about our ability to raise more capital via equity and debt issuance. I think as you can see from our performance so far and the 2121 plan, those concerns are unfounded. There's no reason that we have to stop issuing fixed income instruments. We're not encumbered by any EBITDA covenants or any particular other cash flow covenants that'll keep us from doing that. And as you could see, some people have asked, can you keep doing ATMs? And I think we put that to rest by filing a $21 billion ATM. We're going to expand and we're going to accelerate our treasury operations and our capital raising activities based upon the performance you've seen. And with our newfound insights, we just keep getting. We get new insights every single quarter in this market and we're learning. But as we learn, we get a bit more sophisticated in how we do this. Now I'm going to wade into the big premium debate here, like what's the appropriate premium for net asset against net asset value of MicroStrategy? And I just want to make one obvious point. We're a growth company. We're a bitcoin treasury company and we are growing. We are built on an asset, bitcoin, which is growing 50% a year and we are growing with that asset. If you review the market for common multiples of growth companies, if you had a 20% growth company, oftentimes they're valued at 25 times 40, 25 to 40 PTE. If you have a 30% growth company, oftentimes they valued at 35 to 55 PTE. If you have a 40% growth company, they're valued at 45 to 70 sometimes. And a company growing 50% is oftentimes valued at 60 to 100x. And of course Bitcoin's growing 50%. We don't know what it'll do in the future. But my personal long term view is over 21 years bitcoin is going to grow 29% ARR. And looking backward, it's definitely been growing fast, 50% every year for four years. So, how do you think about the value of the BTC, the bitcoin treasury operations, right? Not the balance sheet, not the reserves, but what's the operation worth? And if you expect 30% to 50% growth for bitcoin, then it's not unreasonable to have a 30 to 50x multiple for that growth. And a 30x to 50x multiple means, if you were to look at this 6% to 10% target, 30 times 10 is a 300% premium to net asset value. 50 times 10 is a 500% premium. So you're talking about an operation that's 3 to 5 net asset value. And if you tack on the actual treasury, you go from there and you realize you're talking about an enterprise that could be $80 billion to $100 billion. And you could establish it just by looking at this and realizing it. These are not U.S. T bills that we're holding on our balance sheet. If you had a U.S. treasury bill that was growing 0% a year, you would multiply it times 20 in order to get a right multiple. But bitcoin's growing more than 0% a year, so 20x is probably conservative. So that's one way to approach it. Another way to approach it is look at the BTC gain. And that is what's really happening here. When we have a 5% BTC yield in the quarter, that's the same as acquiring 12,500 bitcoin for our shareholders without dilution, that's like 50,000 bitcoin on an annualized basis, that's like a $3.6 billion annualized BTC gain. If you had a $3.6 billion annualized gain and you put a 30 to 50 multiple on it, you've all of a sudden got an operation that's got a $108 billion to $180 billion value. And then you tack on the other 18 billion for the bitcoin and you see where you get. It's like the operation 6 to 10 times net asset value, plus the reserves. And so, most of the market doesn't understand it and most of the debate has been this assumption that we're somehow some holding company that just got lucky and occasionally sell some equity. And we're not adding any value to the market. But hopefully, if you look at these numbers I've shown you, you realize that the value we're adding to the market is to create high performance, high volatility securities for one group of investors, and do that based on our unique structure and provide low volatility, lower performance, lower risk securities for another set of investors. And in that regard, we are the leader. Nobody else has $18 billion of permanent capital. In order to create a company like ours, you're going to have to actually go 100% all Bitcoin, and how do you do that at our scale? If you do it with, if you do it with a big tech company, they'll never be 100% Bitcoin, because they got too much other stuff in their enterprise. And if you do it with $1 billion company they're not going to catch us, because as you could see, we're not slowing down. We're actually going, we're going to target $10 billion of capital next year. So unless you're going to target $42 billion of capital in the next three years, then MicroStrategy is kind of in a unique position. So if you start thinking about like that, and I'll just leave one other thought with you, which is if you. And again, like, I don't have a crystal ball, there's risk in all of this. But you understand our 21/21 Plan, if we achieve our 21/21 Plan, if Bitcoin grows in excess of 21%, if that happens, MicroStrategy is capable of BTC gains, in excess of $10 billion a year within four years. And so, thinking about a business like that that's growing more than 20%, starts to put in perspective that yes, we shouldn't just be valued based on our Bitcoin reserves. The real issue, is what are the opportunities for us as a Bitcoin treasury company. And so with that, we can go to the next slide. Shirish, Phong said it, but I'll say it again. The world's largest ATM equity offering is to buy Bitcoin. And you could look at it and say, oh yes, great, I get it. But do you really get it? Here's the big idea. The reason that this is the largest ATM equity offering and it is to buy Bitcoin, is because any other company that announced a $21 billion ATM would be expected to invest the capital in something dilutive. If you sold $21 billion of equity and you bought T-Bills, you would be losing $2 billion a year, guaranteed. That's an awful idea. If you sold $21 billion of equity, and you went and bought another company, it's a risky acquisition. It'll take three to five years. I can tell you, as a public company, CEO for 30 years of my life, well, from 98 all the way to 2022, 24 years, I can tell you that 90% to 95% of acquisitions all failed dismally. Just a couple of percent ever really worked. So issuing this equity, to do an acquisition is very risky. And so, then what are you going to do? You're going to buy up real estate, build a building for five years? Are you going to build a new product? Are you going to hire 10,000 people? The problem in the market is most people don't have a good use of proceeds. Bitcoin is the best use of proceeds, maybe in the history of the capital markets. We're building, in essence a digital building in five days. We could raise $500 million, buy Bitcoin with it, show that there's a BTC yield, announce it a few days later, and then build another $500 million building. And all along the way, our shareholders have complete transparency into the credit, complete transparency into the risk. And we've got a metric that at a glance tells you, whether it's a creative or dilutive, and whether or not we're getting more efficient, right. Is the BTC spread improving to the benefit of the shareholders, or is it degrading? So we're very straightforward, very transparent. And because we have a balance sheet positively polarized toward capital, and we have a transparent, accretive use of capital. And because it's a high speed investment cycle, it's five days instead of five years. This makes total sense for our investors. In fact, I can tell you, and I've met with a lot of our investors, their number one concern isn't are you going to dilute us or issue more equity? Their number one concern has been all along. You're not going to stop, are you? Do you have to stop? Because we don't want you to stop. So, this is actually addressing concerns, and the needs of, and the benefits that accrue to our MSTR common stock shareholders. And I think it just illustrates the strength of our overall treasury strategy, and the strength of the Bitcoin market. Next slide. Okay. You've been troopers, you've stayed with me the entire time. I appreciate your attention, and I want to end with these principles. And I think they're very important, because if you're a MicroStrategy shareholder, you're coming with us on this journey, and hopefully you see that we're in this for the long-term, and we want to be as transparent and consistent, and reliable and understandable as we can possibly be to you. So these are our Bitcoin treasury company BTC principles. One, we are going to buy and hold Bitcoin indefinitely, exclusively, securely, right? The company is built on this idea. If you're waiting for us to hedge, to sell it, to get out on top, if you're looking for us to diversify, go elsewhere, right? If you're a banker pitching me the idea of buying a value stock, buy some other cash cow company with my stock. So that I can get them on the Bitcoin standard, my answer is what, are you going to offer me that's better than 29% ARR risk free for the next 21 years, right. We are focused on Bitcoin long-term, long hot time horizon. So that's the number one principle. It's very important. Everything else is built on it. Number two principle, we're going to prioritize MicroStrategy common stock shareholders for - long-term. And we're going to prioritize long-term value creation. If you own MSTR, you're my partner. You and I are in it together. When I meet with the MSTR shareholders, we talk about their ideas. They say you should do an ATM. Well, how much leverage should we take on, what should we be willing to do or not do? How do you feel about this, right? And their interests are my interest, they are the management team's interest. And if there's any question in your mind, like what do, you want to own for maximum performance over the next decade or 20 years, right. The way we keep score is MSTR performance. Number three, treat all investors with respect, consistency and transparency. Note, every investor is our respected counterparty. If you've got a call option on MicroStrategy that expires in 30 days, I respect you. I'm glad you do business with us. We appreciate the support, right. But we're not going to run the business in order to maximize the call option on day 29, if the call option expires out of the money. I'm sorry, I couldn't do anything about that. We're going to optimize for the long-term common stock, because otherwise nobody can do anything else. All of the other securities above and below the common stock wouldn't work. So, if you want to short us, have at it. I respect that too. By all means, more the merrier, because you're short $1 billion. You're going to buy $1 billion when we need you to buy it. And so it's fine. But of course, don't make the mistake of thinking that I'm going to serve your interest either, right. Our interests are to make sure that we make good on our obligations. If we make a promise, we will meet our promise to our creditors, to everybody else. And that just means be consistent, be transparent, be respectful. And I want people to know they can trust us to do what we said we're going to do. I expect that we will have lots of different types of investors with lots of different strategies. In fact, there's already almost infinite number of strategies. Long, short, hedged, people trading vol, people selling vol, people levering up. It's like it's impossible to figure them out. Just be clear that, we're going to think about one and two and then I don't try to out think the quants with the Bloomberg. I know they are smarter and faster, and they have an opinion. Let them do what they're going to do. All I want to say is, we're going to do our best not to compete with you. We're going to let you do your thing, we're going to respect you. And whatever we say we're going to do, we're going to do. Four, structure MSTR to outperform BTC. No offense to BTC I love BTC. I tweet about BTC every day of my life. But MicroStrategy stock is going to be intelligently levered, and our goal is to be more than BTC more volatile, higher performance. I'd be happy if we're 1.5. If you told me we were 2, I'm like pleasantly surprised and I love it. But we can't guarantee what that number will be. We can't even guarantee we will. But what I can tell you is our principle, is we will structure the business so rationally, everything we've done is with the aim of MicroStrategy being like a 1.5x BTC. We want a comfortable, responsible boost so that we can support everybody else in the market. Number five, we're going to acquire BTC continually. We'll just, we're going to keep stacking. And the way that we're going to stack, is while pursuing positive BTC yield. Look I mean, we could sell the stock, at a negative premium and add BTC, but it would be dilutive to the shareholders. There are a lot of times when we could - you know, we could raise capital and it's actually quite accretive, but it's not as a. But we don't like the spreads, and it looks worse than we think they'll be like next week. And so, we'll just hold out and wait, because we want to support the market and we just don't think it's appropriate. So, we have the ability to move aggressively when the opportunity presents itself, and we have the ability to wait and do nothing when that's the right thing to do. But you can invest in 500 other companies, and 500 other companies can make 10,000 capital investments. And after they make them, you can talk to the management team and try to figure out, was that building profitable, was that acquisition profitable? Should we have done that with shareholder money? Was that a good idea or not? And to tell you the truth, you could write 100,000 pages on that. And sometimes you never really know. And I think the thing that's special about MicroStrategy, which is really nice, is we're giving you the true north BTC yield. We're telling you every time we look at a deal, you know, somebody calls me and says, hi, you should do this and this and I calculate it. I calculate the BTC yield. I say well, that's not the most compelling option. Our shareholders won't respect me. We will publish it. We will be transparent. And so BTC yield really simplifies things a lot. It's like - I said, you want to make the investment in five days, and you want to know whether it was accretive for your shareholders. And then, if you're really honest and truthful and transparent, you tell them. And that's what we do. We're very proud of the fact that we tell you exactly, what we're going to do and we'll report on ourself. And some quarters are better BTC yield than others. Some deals have a greater BTC yield than others, and so understand it. And we're going to be pursuing it, because at the end of the day, we generate BTC yield, we generate BTC gain. We generate BTC gain, we put value in the Bitcoin operation, and that's the motor that drives the common stock and it drives Bitcoin. Six, our sixth principle is we're going to grow rapidly, but responsibly. And of course we're going to do it subject to market dynamics. The market changes every week, sometimes every day. We're paying attention. I can't tell you what we're going to do, because the thing that makes sense when the market is in one dynamic state, all of a sudden doesn't make sense three days later. But what you can be sure is we're going to pursue growth, and we're going to do it in a responsible fashion. Our seventh principle, we're going to issue innovative fixed income securities that are backed by Bitcoin, right? I just showed you those convertible bonds. That's a great secret, but it's pretty extraordinary. How do you buy Bitcoin with less volatility, less risk, and get Bitcoin returns? Pretty neat idea. There are other good ideas. There are other ideas that we think will appeal to people in the capital market. Some of them will appeal to Bitcoin investors. Some will appeal to crypto enthusiasts, some will appeal to conventional investors. We're going to stay in our lane. Our lane is we have a Bitcoin treasury reserve and its permanent capital. And that means that we can find innovative fixed income ideas. Why do I single out fixed income? Because fixed income, is what creates the most leverage that drives MSTR common. And when we do it, when we do fixed income correctly, we're going to generate that 1.5x or 2x Bitcoin return. And that makes everybody happy. And that leads me to eight, right? If you're going to do seven, you got to think eight. Eight is maintain a healthy, robust, pristine balance sheet. Now people are going to say, well, what does pristine mean? Well, it means transparent. It means homogeneous. There is one risk you take when you invest in MicroStrategy. There's a risk you take when you buy our fixed income securities. The risk, the obvious overarching risk, is you take Bitcoin risk, right? You're accepting the risk that Bitcoin itself could fail. And if you're not willing to accept a Bitcoin existential systemic risk, then you probably shouldn't own any of our securities, right? Because we're a Bitcoin company. But once you've accepted Bitcoin risk, there's a lot of people in the world, a lot of investors, they'll say to me, Mike, I love Bitcoin, I believe in Bitcoin, I just can't stand the volatility. Or I believe in Bitcoin, but I need like a guaranteed coupon. Or I believe in Bitcoin, but I can't be marking this to market in my strategy, or my strategy doesn't let me do this. So there are a lot of people that will accept that. But after that, they want to know that we're going to execute responsibly. So that means we want a straightforward balance sheet. We want you to understand it. It's very, very straightforward. These are our assets, these are our liquid assets, right? We don't want to have complications. The reason we wanted to repay the 28, $500 million senior bond. Too many complications, too many caveats, too many, you know, too many restrictions, and what we've learned over the four years, is when we have complications in the balance sheet like the Silvergate loan, or like this 28 senior note. Those things undermine our ability to serve our common stock shareholders, and they undermine our ability to issue converts. And they undermine our ability to serve Bitcoin, and to do the right thing for the capital market. So, we are enthusiastic, but we're also very disciplined. And we know that we need to be viewed, as having a pristine balance sheet in the Bitcoin business, in the Bitcoin treasury business. And so that's why we value that. And then nine, and I'll end with this. We're going to promote global adoption of BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Promote it to countries, promote it to cities, promote it to states, promote it to companies, to public companies, promote it to private companies. I speak with public company executives. I speak with private company executives. We sponsor Bitcoin for corporations. Our belief - is that Bitcoin is a solution to the problem that 95% of public companies have, and I guess 99% of private companies have, which is they don't have healthy balance sheets. Bitcoin fixes the balance sheet. It'll bring your stock back to life. It'll bring your options back to life. It'll bring volatility. Everybody is negatively polarized to capital. We want to flip the switch and positively polarize them to capital. So unlike a lot of industries where you don't want competitors in our business, we're happy to share the playbook. We're happy to advocate. We'll show you how to do it. Everybody can win. There are no losers on the Bitcoin standard. There are only varying degrees of winners. And so with that, I would like to thank everybody for your time and I guess, Shirish, let's go to questions. I have slightly more than 50% of the voting stock right now. And as we raise additional capital, I expect that my voting interest will slip below into the high 40s. If we raise a lot of capital, it might slip into, move into the mid-40s or the low-40s, but I'm not at all concerned about it. First of all, we're going to run this company in partnership with our common stock shareholders. And I meet with them routinely. There's nothing that we are going to do that they're not going to want us to do. And so, so, perhaps in order to get over 50%, I might have two or three of them join with me on occasion. But I actually look forward to that. So I think our common stock shareholders should know that they're our partners, and they deserve a say in the company. They'll have a greater say in the company and that's fine. I don't really think there's - any reason that our company can't operate just fine with me having 48% of the vote instead of 52% of the vote. As you can see our principles, you can see our plan. I think that substantially I'll have enough voting shares, to ensure that the company stays on track, but I'm not at all concerned about, issuing additional equity."

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you Phong. First, I'll take a few minutes to expand upon the software business results. Moving to Slide 12, earlier this year we enhanced our reported numbers to breakout our quarterly results into two categories. First, the software business category reflects income or loss from operations related specifically to our BI business. The Corporate and other category represents the non-software related areas, associated with our digital assets holdings, which include impairment charges and other related third-party costs. While we continue to operate under one reportable operating segment. We believe the breakout of our operating results into these two categories, provides more transparency with respect to the performance of our software business, while isolating the impacts related to changes in Bitcoin price. In Q3, software business revenues were $116 million, down 10% year-over-year consistent with recent quarters, the overall revenue trend reflects the ongoing transition of our business from on-premise to cloud. As part of that transition, we fully expect product license along with support revenues, to decline impacting total revenues consistent with this quarter's results. We are building up stronger, more durable cloud recurring revenues that come in overtime, which is consistent for any on-prem to cloud transition. Q3 Cloud bookings was strong in line with the prior quarter and if you recall, Q2 was the strongest single quarter cloud bookings to-date. This increase last quarter helps offset the lower than expected product license contracts, we closed this quarter and reflects the transition taking shape. As Phong mentioned earlier, non-GAAP subscription billings, which represent cloud revenues in the quarter, along with the next 12 months of deferred subscription services revenues, grew by 93% in Q3 year-over-year to $32.4 million, reflecting double-digit growth in every quarter, for the last four straight years since launching our cloud transition. Q3 subscription services revenues, increased 32% year-over-year and now make up approximately 24% of total revenues. Subscription services revenues are now larger than our product license revenues, and will continue to grow while product license revenue will continue to decline further going forward. While we will see the initial benefits of last quarter's strong cloud migrations, flow through revenue beginning next quarter, the lower product license bookings in 2024, will result in recognized revenue below our target for the full year, but in line with the revised target we discussed last quarter. We expect this year and next year will reflect the transition point in our long-term strategy after, which we expect total revenues will begin to grow again. Cost of revenues were $34 million, which was up 29% compared to Q3 of last year. The increase was due in part to higher cloud hosting costs, a direct result of our growing cloud, which we expect to continue in future periods. Software business operating expenses were $100 million, up 7% compared to Q3 of last year, while overall personnel costs were down year-over-year. The increase that I just described year-over-year, was in part largely attributed to higher stock-based compensation, and higher custody fees related to our increased Bitcoin Holdings, but also offset by savings in other G&A categories. In Q3, we also recognized close to $14 million in severance costs related to workforce optimization in the quarter, which will result in approximately $30 million in lower salary costs next year. This strategic planning across all departments in the company, is focused on right sizing overall staffing levels, optimizing organizational structures, and focusing on a disciplined performance management culture. As a result, annual staffing costs are expected to be approximately 13% lower next year, which will further benefit our margin profile in 2025. Overall non-GAAP operating income or profit from the software business category, was $0.9 million. Lastly, the corporate and other operating expense category for the quarter was $414 million, the majority of, which was due to Bitcoin impairment in Q3. Now turning to our Bitcoin strategy, we had another very successful quarter in adding more Bitcoin to our treasury reserves, as we acquired 25,889 Bitcoins in the third quarter for approximately $1.6 billion at an average price of $60,839 per Bitcoin. As of September 30, the company held a total of 252,200 Bitcoins acquired for an aggregate cost of $9.9 billion, or approximately $39,000 per Bitcoin. I will speak to our overall treasury operations for the quarter in a moment, but a significant result of redeeming our 2028 senior secured notes in Q3, was to release all Bitcoin that was held at the MicroStrategy entity. And now 100% of our Bitcoin holdings, are fully unencumbered, including now all Bitcoins held at both macro strategy and MicroStrategy entities. We have added Bitcoin to our treasury balance sheet in every quarter since August 2020, and as we continue to champion Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset, we are encouraged by the number of both public and private companies that are adopting the Bitcoin treasury standard, to help impact shareholder value. As of September 30, 2024, the market value of our Bitcoin holdings was $16 billion at an aggregate cost of $9.9 billion, and an average purchase price of $39,000. This is in contrast to the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings of $6.9 billion as of the last day of the quarter. We will adopt the new FASB fair - accounting rule, which will require fair value treatment for Bitcoin holdings when the rule takes effect in Q1, 2025. As of January 1, 2025, we will recognize a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance of our retained earnings, reflecting in large part the significant difference between the market value, and carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings. Now turning to our treasury operations, we had one of our most impactful quarters from a capital markets execution perspective. Following the two convertible note financings we completed earlier in March and in June of this year, we executed a new convertible note financing in September, which was upsized and well received by the market. We issued $1.01 billion of convertible senior notes, due September 2028, at an annual interest rate of 0.625% with a conversion premium of 40%, and a conversion price of approximately $183 per share. The net proceeds from the new convert, were used to redeem the 2028 Senior Secured Notes, and to acquire additional Bitcoin. We redeemed in full the $500 million 2028 senior secured notes, at a redemption price equal to 103.063% of the principal amount of the 2028 secured notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. We achieved multiple benefits through early redemption. All restrictive covenants in connection with the secured notes were eliminated, all of our Bitcoin holdings became fully unencumbered, and we realized a net annualized interest expense savings of $24 million for the next four years, equaling close to $100 million in total future debt expense savings. In Q3, we also issued $1.1 billion worth of common equity under our at-the-market ATM program. Under the existing ATM program, approximately $891 million of common equity remains available for issuance. As Phong mentioned earlier today, as part of our new 21/21 three-year strategic capital plan, we filed a new prospectus supplement for a $21 billion ATM program. This will be the single largest ATM program filed in the U.S. across all sectors. Under our current capital structure, we now have $4.3 billion of unsecured convertible debt outstanding with a sub 1% blended interest rate of approximately 0.81%, with staggered maturities over several years starting in February 2027, through June 2032, all which are currently trading above parents. Year-to-date 2024, we are the number one issuer of convertible notes in the U.S. by aggregate principal raised. Intelligent leverage remains a key component of our active capital allocation strategy, which when deployed in a thoughtful and disciplined manner, enables us to add more Bitcoin to our treasury reserve, at an attractive cost and in a manner that achieves BTC yield. I'll elaborate on the intelligent leverage and BTC yield concepts in the next few slides. This slide lays out our debt maturity profile, and as you can see, the nearest debt maturity is more than two years away and not until early 2027. The remainder of our debt maturities, are evenly spread over several years out to 2032 with and weighted average debt maturity of approximately five years. We actively monitor the capital markets, and will continuously evaluate liability management opportunities, to manage our debt and interest expense, as well as opportunities to raise additional financings in the future. Year-to-date in 2024, our total Bitcoin holdings increased by 33.3%. During the same period, our assumed diluted shares outstanding increased by only 13.2%. When we refer to assumed diluted shares outstanding, we are assuming all outstanding convertible notes are fully converted, at their respective conversion prices, all outstanding options are fully exercised, and all restricted stock units and performance stock units fully vest in each case without regard to exercise or conversion price, or vesting or any other contractual condition. As a Bitcoin treasury company-based on market conditions, we intend to continue to access equity capital markets, and to explore various opportunities in the debt and fixed income capital markets, to effectively manage our overall leverage. Our track record of using equity, debt and excess cash to acquire Bitcoin, as part of our treasury operations has resulted in value creation for our shareholders and establishes the foundation to execute on our 21/21 capital plan. Our objective continues to be to accumulate Bitcoin holdings, at a faster rate than we issue shares, and we have demonstrated a solid track record of doing so. To assess our performance in achieving this strategic objective, we introduced a new key performance indicator last quarter, which we refer to as BTC yield. To reiterate again, we define BTC yield as a period-to-period percentage change in the ratio of our total Bitcoin holdings, to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. We use this KPI to help assess the achievement of our strategic objective, and to evaluate capital allocation decisions. If we increase our total Bitcoin holdings over a given period, at a faster pace, then we increase our assumed diluted shares outstanding, we achieve a positive BTC yield. I should note here that BTC yield, is not equivalent to yield in the traditional financial context. It is simply a measure of the percentage change period-to-period in the ratio of our Bitcoin holdings, to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. In addition, when we use BTC yield, we assume that all indebtedness will be refinanced or, in the case of our convertible notes, converted into shares of common stock, at their respective conversion prices, and that it does not take into account debt and or other liabilities. Although BTC yield is not actually a yield in the traditional sense. We internally think about this metric, as some might think about a bond yield, or a yield of another financial instrument. We view this metric as helping us and our shareholders assess, whether we're using our capital most efficiently to increase our Bitcoin holdings over time. The historical performance of this KPI is shown on this slide, we achieved an annual BTC yield of 43.3% in 2021, 1.8% in 2022 and 7.3% in 2023. As we have achieved quarterly BTC yield of 8.1% in Q1, 3.7% in Q2, and 5.1% in Q3. Management uses BTC yield, to evaluate capital allocation decisions, and to measure the achievement of our strategy. Achieving BTC yield sets us apart from Spot Bitcoin ETPs and other Bitcoin investment vehicles that charge a management fee, and would therefore reflect a negative BTC yield as we measure it. Building on the 21/21 Plan Phong discussed, we have a clear strategy to increase our Bitcoin holdings and deliver a positive annual BTC yield. Our year-to-date 2024 BTC yield of 17.8% has surpassed the annual BTC yield in 2023. Last quarter, we laid out our target to achieve a BTC yield of 4% to 8% annually for the next three years through 2027. Today, we are revising our target up to achieve BTC yield of 6% to 10% per year for each of the next three years. To do this, we will seek to accumulate more Bitcoin holdings, by responsibly using intelligent leverage, with a risk managed approach, using proceeds from equity when we believe accretive and using the excess cash generated by our software business. We will continue to consider the full spectrum of financing options, and also explore creative capital, market transactions and untapped pools of capital. To execute this strategy effectively and prudently. We will remain disciplined in the use of both the ATM, and other capital raising alternatives and financings, doing so in a manner to achieve BTC yield in line with our targets. By providing a three year KPI, we are reinforcing our goal of achieving consistent positive BTC yield over time. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of institutional Bitcoin adoption, and as we look to the future, we anticipate that our ability to consistently achieve BTC yield, will become a crucial benchmark for investors. MicroStrategy has demonstrated a strong track record, of applying a disciplined approach to navigate through volatile times in the Bitcoin market. And we believe we have established the credibility, to execute on our strategic goal of adding value for our shareholders. Thank you for your time today, and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Sure. Thanks for the question. In the near term, I guess I'd say, I mentioned earlier, we redeemed the 28 notes, which was our highest cost debt, and by doing so, we reduced our annual cost by about $30 million, or about 50% of our debt load. So that obviously frees up cash in the near term taking out the 28s also release this from all the covenants. So there may be some opportunities to get accretive there. And lastly, but probably more importantly, the 21/21 Plan, we plan to raise, $42 billion of capital and that capital could be used to service interest if needed. So overall, I think, we feel pretty good about our ability to issue new debt, issue new fixed income securities and we'll look forward to those opportunities in the future."

            "name": "Phong Le",
            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. Hello everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar, starting with the Bitcoin highlights for Q3. 2024 MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, now holding 252,220 Bitcoins with a total Bitcoin market value of $18 billion as of yesterday. Since June 30, 2024, we acquired an additional 25,889 Bitcoin for a total purchase cost of $1.6 billion, an average price of $60,839. Year-to-date, 2024, the price of Bitcoin has appreciated, spurred notably by the approval of the Spot Bitcoin Exchange traded products or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention to the asset class. We believe the introduction and initial success of the Spot Bitcoin ETPs evidences the maturation of Bitcoin as an institution grade asset class, with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption. On the capital markets front, we made significant progress towards the advancement of our Bitcoin strategy. In September, we raised $1.1 billion net proceeds, through our at-the-market, or ATM, equity offering program and raised $1.01 billion through the issuance of our 2028 convertible notes. Using part of the proceeds from the 2028 convertible notes, we also redeemed our $500 million senior secured notes, due 2028 in full. As a result, all of our Bitcoin holdings are now unencumbered. Andrew will provide further details on our capital markets and Bitcoin purchase activity for this quarter. As we continue to focus on acquiring more Bitcoin through our capital market activities, we believe that the value proposition in the company centers increasingly on our Bitcoin treasury strategy. As a result, we've developed a new descriptor for what we are, which is the world's first and largest Bitcoin treasury company, the acronym being coincidentally BTC. So what does this mean? We are a publicly traded company that has adopted Bitcoin as our primary treasury reserve asset. By using proceeds from equity and debt financings, as well as cash flows from our operations, we strategically accumulate Bitcoin and advocate for its role as digital capital. Our treasury strategy is designed to provide investors varying degrees of economic exposure to Bitcoin, by offering a range of securities, including equity and fixed income instruments. In addition, we provide industry leading AI-powered enterprise analytics software, advancing our vision of intelligence everywhere. We leverage our development capabilities, to explore innovation in Bitcoin applications. Integrating analytics expertise with our commitment to digital asset growth. We believe our combination of operational excellence, our strategic Bitcoin reserve and our focus on technological innovation, positions us as a leader in both the digital asset and enterprise analytics sectors, offering a unique opportunity for long-term value creation. Michael will further elaborate on our vision as a Bitcoin treasury company. Since our adoption of our Bitcoin strategy, we've used three primary mechanisms to acquire more Bitcoin. One, debt financing we have $4.3 billion in principal amount of convertible debt outstanding and an attractive blended cost of debt fixed at 0.8% annually. Two, equity issuances, we've issued $4.3 billion in equity in a manner that we believe to be accretive to existing shareholders, and three cash flows from our software operations. Since August 2020, we've invested $836 million of total cash on our balance sheet. These capital market levers allow us to deploy intelligent leverage to increase our Bitcoin holdings in a manner, which we believe shareholder value. So where do we go next from here? For those who are familiar with the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, they would know, what is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything. In this science fiction series, an enormous supercomputer named Deep Thought calculated the answer to this question over a period of 7.5 million years. And of course, the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is the number 42. We also think it's the answer to important question. And we spent about four years thinking about this question. We believe it's a unique number with some special characteristics. It's the sum of 21 plus 21. And we all know that 21 is a magic, a magical number. In the world of Bitcoin, there can only ever be a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins in circulation. MicroStrategy owns about 1.2% of this Bitcoin today. Today, MicroStrategy is announcing its ambitious capital market strategic plan for the next three years, from the years 2025 to 2027, the company is targeting to raise $42 billion of capital, comprised of $21 billion of equity capital and $21 billion of fixed income capital, primarily for the purpose of acquiring Bitcoin. Today, we have filed a prospectus supplement for a new $21 billion ATM equity program. This is the largest ATM in the history of capital markets. Fixed income capital can consist of various debt and debt like instruments, including convertible debt, preferred equity, hybrid capital or other similar instruments. So I'd like to provide more detail on our capital raising targets over the next three years. For the year 2025, we target raising $10 billion total comprised of approximately $5 billion each of equity capital, and fixed income capital. For the year 2026, we target raising $14 billion, comprised of approximately $7 billion each of equity capital, and fixed income capital. And for the year 2027, we target raising $18 billion, comprised of approximately $9 billion each of equity capital and fixed income capital. We plan to address increased interest costs from any incremental fixed income capital raise, through efficient management of our overall capital raising plan, including alternating between equity raises and debt raises as appropriate. To maintain our overall intelligent leverage. By managing our treasury strategy in this way, so long as we continued access to equity capital in favorable terms. We believe we will not be limited by the cash flows from our software business, to scale up our Bitcoin capital markets initiatives. Turning to the software business, MicroStrategy is also positioned as the world's largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company. In the third quarter of 2024, we continued our shift towards our cloud offering, non-GAAP subscription billings, which represent cloud revenues in the quarter, along with just the next 12 months of deferred subscription services, revenues grew by 93% in Q3 to $32.4 million, our fourth straight year of quarterly double-digit growth. The strong growth in our subscription billings, was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud, and new customer wins. Our customer renewal rates continue to remain high, and our subscription services revenues remain strong. Overall, we see strong demand for our cloud platform, and Q3 was a particularly strong quarter for customers migrating to the cloud. Our objective continues to be to increase cloud revenue by migrating customers to cloud, while maintaining profitability. MicroStrategy ONE, is now available on Azure, AWS and Google Cloud marketplaces, allowing enterprises to easily find and deploy this cloud native platform. Customers can benefit from a range of innovative first to market AI powered functionality, powered by the Azure OpenAI LLM, which also creates demand for our cloud platform. Transitioning our customer base to the technology of the future remains a key focus, and our hyperscaler partners are a key part of this migration. As customers and prospects move to the cloud to empower their AI driven digital transformations, we expect to continue to see, a decrease in product license revenues and support revenues, which will in part be offset by increases in subscription services revenues. We expect this trend to continue in the balance of 2024. This may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short-term, but in the long run we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenues. Additional benefits include more engaged customers using our very latest software, higher retention rates, and ultimately growing recurring in overall revenues. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew, to discuss our financials for the first quarter in further detail. Look, I want to thank the several thousands of you who attended our earnings call today. I understand it's an elongated session, and I appreciate your support and hopefully you've seen from our remarks, we are quite enthusiastic about the future of Bitcoin, and the future of MicroStrategy, and the potential for value creation for all of our shareholders. We believe that the Bitcoin treasury company strategy and the enterprise software strategy, is going to create growth and value. So we wish everybody a good quarter, a happy holidays, and we look forward to seeing all of you again in 12 weeks. Thank you all."

And then, Michael Saylor will provide a strategic review and discuss recent bitcoin market updates. And lastly, we will open up to Q&A. With that, I will turn the call over to Phong Le, President and CEO of MicroStrategy.\nPhong Le: Thank you, Shirish. Hello everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar. As we discussed in the last two quarters, MicroStrategy considers itself to be the world's first bitcoin development company. We're a publicly traded operating company committed to the continued development of the bitcoin network through our activities in the financial markets, advocacy, and technology innovation. As an operating business, we're able to use cash flows, as well as proceeds from equity and debt financings to accumulate bitcoin, which serves as our primary treasury reserve asset. We believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for value creation. Being an operating company, our Software Technology business remains our core revenue and cash flow generator. In addition, it also enables us to acquire bitcoin thorough the use of excess cash or proceeds from equity capital raises or corporate debt capital raises. These capital market levers allow us to deploy intelligent leverage to increase our bitcoin holdings in a manner which we believe has created shareholder value. Since our adoption of our bitcoin strategy, we have used three primary mechanisms to acquire more bitcoin. Cash flows from software orations; since August, 2020, we've invested $836 million of total cash in our balance sheet. Equity issuances; we have issued $3.2 billion in equity in a manner that we believe to be accretive to existing shareholders; and debt financing, we had $3.8 billion in debt outstanding through the issuance of both Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Notes. We've used the proceeds from these issuances, principally, to purchase bitcoin. The blended cost of our outstanding debt is fixed at 1.6% annually. Turning to the bitcoin highlights for Q2 2024, MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world, now holding 226,500 bitcoins, with a total bitcoin market value at $15 billion as of yesterday. Since March 31, 2024, we acquired an additional 12,222 bitcoin for a total purchase cost of $805 million, an average price of $65,882. Year-to-date 2024, the price of bitcoin has appreciated, spurred notably by the approval of the Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Products, or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention. We believe the introduction and initial success of the Spot Bitcoin ETPs evidences the maturation of bitcoin as an institution-grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption. We attended the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, in Nashville, last week, and we saw tremendous support for the bitcoin ecosystem, from policymakers, bipartisan politicians, institutions, businesses, and individuals. It's very encouraging to see high-profile institutions and individuals showing interest in bitcoin, and starting to appreciate the importance of this asset class as a part of their portfolios. MicroStrategy remains highly committed to our bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus. Michael will further elaborate later with his thoughts and takeaways from the Bitcoin 2024 Conference. On the capital markets front, we made significant progress towards the advancement of our bitcoin development company strategy. In June, we raised $800 million through 2032 maturity convertible notes, called for our $650 million 2025 convertible notes, announced 10:1 stock split, and announced a $2 billion at-the-market, or ATM, equity offering program. Andrew will further provide details on our capital markets and bitcoin purchase activity for this quarter. As a bitcoin development company, we have the unique ability to access the capital markets to create intelligent leverage. During the first and second quarter of 2024, our total bitcoin holdings increased by 13.3% and 5.6%, respectively. During the same periods, our assumed diluted shares outstanding increased by only 4.8% and 1.8%, respectively. When we refer to assumed diluted shares outstanding, we're assuming all outstanding convertible notes or fully converted at the respective conversion prices. All outstanding options are fully exercised. And all restricted stock units and performance stock units fully vest, in each case without regard to exercise or conversion price or investing or other contractual conditions. Our opportunistic use of leverage and excess cash to acquire bitcoin, as well as our strategic execution of our capital markets' financings resulted in an incremental value creation for our shareholders. Our objective is to accumulate bitcoin holdings at a faster rate than we issue shares. And we believe we have a demonstrated track record of doing so. To assess our performance in achieving this strategic objective, we're introducing a new key performance indicator which we refer to as BTC Yield. We define BTC Yield as the period-to-period percentage change in the ratio of our total bitcoin holdings to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. We use this KPI to help assess the achievement of our strategic objective and for evaluating capital allocation decisions. If we increase our total bitcoin holding over a given period at a faster pace than we increased our assumed diluted shares outstanding, we achieve a positive bitcoin yield. I should note here that bitcoin yield is not equivalent to yield in the traditional financial context. It's simply just a measure of the percentage change, period-to-period, in the ratio of our bitcoin holdings to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. In addition, when we use Bitcoin Yield, we consider the various limitations of this metric, including that it assumes that all indebtedness will be refinanced or, in the case of our convertible notes, converted into shares of common stock at their respective conversion prices. And it does not take into account debt and other liabilities. Although bitcoin yield is not actually a yield in the traditional finance context, we internally think about this metric as some might think about a bond yield or a yield on another financial instrument. It's obviously an imperfect analogy, but we look to the metric to help us assess how we are doing on using our capital most efficiently to increase our bitcoin holdings over time. The historical performance of this KPI is shown on this slide. We achieved an annual bitcoin yield of 47.3% in 2021, 1.8% in 2023, and 7.3% in 2023. We've achieved quarterly bitcoin yield of 8.1% in Q1, and 3.7% in Q2, surpassing the annual bitcoin yield in 2023 as of the year-to-date 2024. We're able to achieve this through the acquisition of bitcoin using our excess cash flows and proceeds from debt and equity financings, which we believe were accretive to shareholders. Management uses Bitcoin Yield to evaluate capital allocation decisions, and to measure the achievement of our bitcoin strategy. Our strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner we believe to be accretive to shareholders, thereby achieving bitcoin yield, sets us apart from institutional bitcoin investment options that charge a management fee, and we therefore achieve a negative bitcoin yield as we measure it. Building on our previous discussion, we have a clear strategy to enhance our bitcoin holdings and deliver a positive annual bitcoin yield. Today, we are announcing our target to achieve a bitcoin yield of 4% to 8% per year for the next three years in 2025, 2026, and 2027. Our approach includes accumulating more bitcoin holdings by 1, using the organic excess cash flows generated by our software business 2, using proceeds from equity offerings when we believe accretive and 3, responsibly using the Intelligent Leverage Framework with a risk-managed approach. We will continue to use the full spectrum of financing options and also explore creative capital market transactions and untapped pools of capital to execute this strategy effectively and prudently. By sharing our three-year KPI targets, we are reinforcing our goal of achieving consistent positive bitcoin yield over time. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of institutional bitcoin adoption, and as we look into the future, we anticipate that our ability to consistently achieve positive bitcoin yield will become a crucial benchmark for investors to assess our execution of our strategy. Turning to the software business, MicroStrategy is also positioned as the world's largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company. In the second quarter of 2024, we continued our shift towards our cloud offering, resulting in subscription services revenue of $24 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The strong growth in our subscription services revenue was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer renewal rates continue to remain high and our non-GAAP subscription billings remain strong. Overall, we see strong demand for our cloud platform and Q2 was a particularly strong quarter for customers migrating to cloud. Our objective continues to be growing cloud revenue by migrating customers to cloud while maintaining profitability. At our MicroStrategy World User Conference held in Las Vegas in May 2024, we showcased how MicroStrategy ONE with AI can create more innovative, competitive, high-performing organizations. In our keynote address, we highlighted how some of the biggest brands in the world, including organizations like Lori, Bayer, and the U.S. Department of State, leverage our platform to successfully utilize their data and combat the big data stupor and application sprawl. We unveiled Auto Express to offer an easy and insightful way to engage with MicroStrategy AI, allowing users to build their own standalone AI BI bot without a single line of code. Earlier this year, MicroStrategy ONE became available on the Google Cloud Marketplace, in addition to prior deployments on Azure and AWS, allowing enterprises to easily find and deploy this cloud-native platform. Customers can benefit from a wide range of innovative, first-to-market AI-powered functionality, powered by the Azure OpenAI LLM. Transitioning our customer base to the technology of the future remains a key focus, and our hyperscaler partners are a key part of this migration. As customers and prospects move to the cloud to empower their AI-driven digital transformations, we expect to continue to see a decrease in product license revenues and support revenues, which will in part be offset by increases in subscription services revenues. This will be most pronounced in the balance of 2024. This may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short term, but in the long run, we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenue. Additional benefits include more engaged customers using our very latest software, higher retention rates, and ultimately, growing recurring and overall revenues. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. I'll continue with the recap of our software financial results, and then I'll move on to our bitcoin strategy. Total revenues for the second quarter were $111.4 million, down 7% year-over-year. Consistent with recent quarters, the overall revenue trend reflects the transition of our business from on-premise to cloud. As we migrate customers to the cloud, we shift upfront product license revenues to subscription services revenues, which are recognized readily over the life of a contract. As a result, we fully expect product license revenues, along with support revenues to decline, both of which were down 40% and down 7% respectively year-over-year. What isn't immediately seen through reported revenue is that we are building up stronger, more durable cloud recurring revenue that comes in over time, which is consistent for any on-prem to cloud transition. And more robust or faster cloud migrations will have a larger, but temporary reduction in upfront revenues, which is what we saw in last quarter's results. The cloud contracts booked in Q2 were the strongest single quarter bookings we have seen to date, more than double Q1 or any prior quarter for that matter. This acceleration last quarter makes up for the lower than expected cloud contracts we closed in Q1, meets and beats last year's quarters targets, and directly reflects the transition starting to take shape. While we'll see the initial benefits of last quarter's strong cloud migrations float through revenue beginning next quarter, the lower product license bookings in 2024 will result in lower than expected recognized revenue for the full-year by somewhere between 4% and 5%. Overall total annual revenues have been generally flat in the past couple of years, but with our transition beginning to take shape in the first-half of this year, we expect to see similar patterns in total revenue going forward as we execute on our transformation. This year and potentially in 2025 should reflect the transition point in our long-term strategy, and exiting the next 12 to 18 months we should start seeing total revenues begin to grow again. Non-GAAP subscription billings, which represent cloud revenues in the quarter along with just the next 12 months of deferred subscription services revenues, grew by 45% last quarter to $33.4 million, our fourth straight year of quarterly double-digit growth. Q2 subscription services revenues increased 21% year-over-year, which represents the recognized revenue from previously booked cloud contracts, now make up approximately 22% of total revenues. Subscription services revenues are now larger than our product license revenues and will continue to grow each quarter while product license will decline further from here on out. In Q1, we enhanced our reported numbers to break out our quarterly results into two categories. First, the software business category reflects income or loss from operations related specifically to our BI business. The corporate and other category represents the non-software-related areas associated with our digital asset holdings, which include impairment charges and other related third-party costs. While we continue to operate under one reportable operating segment, we believe the breakout of our operating results into these two categories provides more transparency with respect to the performance of our software business while isolating the impacts related to changes in bitcoin price. In Q2, software business revenues were $111 million that I mentioned a moment ago, while cost of revenues were $31 million, up 14% compared to Q2 of last year. The increase was in part due to higher cloud hosting costs, which is a direct result of our growing cloud business, as well as costs associated with setting up enhancing customer success functions. Software business operating expenses were $99 million, up 4% compared to Q2 of last year. Higher G&A this quarter was related to higher stock-based comp, legal, consulting, and other advisory costs, as well as higher employer payroll taxes in connection with employee stock option exercises in the second quarter. However, overall operating expenses were also offset by lower costs in sales and marketing, consistent with recent quarters, as we maintain strong discipline in expense and cost management. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense in Q2 was $20.6 million, up 33% year-over-year, and overall non-GAAP operating income or profit from the software business category was $1.9 million. Lastly, the corporate and other operating expense category for the quarter was $182 million compared to $25 million in Q2 of last year, $180 million of which was due to bitcoin impairment in the last quarter. Now, turning to our bitcoin strategy, we had another extremely successful quarter of adding more bitcoin to our balance sheet, as we acquired 12,053 bitcoins in the second quarter, and as of July 31st, the company held a total of 226,500 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion or approximately $36,800 per coin. Currently, we hold 175,721 unencumbered bitcoins at MacroStrategy, the wholly-owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy, which represents 78% of our total holdings or $11.4 billion in current market value, all of which are currently unrestricted and unencumbered. The bitcoin we acquired using proceeds from our convertible notes offering in Q2 are held at MicroStrategy, the parent, and serve as collateral securing our 2028 senior secured notes. During Q2, we added 11,931 bitcoins to MicroStrategy's holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $786 million using net proceeds from our convertible note issuance. Additionally, bitcoins purchased using excess cash from the software business are also held at MicroStrategy, the parent, which also serve to collateralize our 2028 senior secured notes. During Q2, we added 122 bitcoins to MicroStrategy's holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $8 million from excess cash. Since the end of Q2, we added an additional 169 bitcoins to MicroStrategy holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $11 million, also using proceeds from excess cash. As of July 31st, 50,779 bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy or $3.3 billion in current market value. The commitment to our bitcoin strategy remains stronger than ever. We have added bitcoin to our treasury in every quarter since August 2020, and as a result, MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world. As we continue to champion bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset, we are deeply encouraged by the growing number of both public and private companies that are adopting the bitcoin standard to help grow shareholder value. As of June 30, 2024, the market value of our bitcoin holdings was $14 billion, and an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion equal to an average purchase price of approximately $36,800. This is in contrast to the carrying value of our bitcoin holdings of $5.7 billion as of the last day of the quarter. We fully plan to adopt the new FASB accounting rule, which requires fair value treatment for bitcoin holdings by Q1 of next year when the rule takes effect, at which time we will realize the benefit of the significant difference between the market value and the carrying value of our balance sheet. Now, turning to our capital markets activities, since the inception of our bitcoin strategy, we have issued $4.4 billion of debt through senior secured notes and convertible notes. We now have $3.8 billion of outstanding debt with a very low blended interest rate of approximately 1.6%, with staggered maturities over several years starting in February 2027 through June 2032. Intelligent leverage remains a key component of our active capital allocation strategy, which when deployed in a thoughtful manner enables us to add more bitcoin to our treasury reserve at an attractive cost and with a disciplined approach to maximizing BTC yield. Continuing with the momentum from the two convertible note financings in March, our recent convert in June was upsized and well-received by the market. We issued $800 million of convertible notes due June 2032 at an annual interest rate of 2.25%, with a conversion premium of 35% and a conversion price of approximately $2,043 per share. As in the past, the net proceeds from the new convert were used to acquire additional bitcoin into our treasury reserve. We will continue to actively manage our existing liabilities and to that end, we called for redemption of our $650 million 2025 convertible notes. As the notes were substantially in the money, holders of those notes converted substantially all of the notes into shares of our Class A common stock prior to the redemption date. Our 2025 notes traded up over 300% from time of issuance, resulting in an extremely successful investment for our bond investors and partners. In addition to raising debt, we continue to demonstrate a solid track record of issuing equity in a manner that is accretive to shareholders. Today we announced that we filed a new shelf registration for $2 billion At-The-Market or ATM equity offering. We will remain extremely disciplined in the use of both the ATM and other capital markets activities executing on them when we believe that will achieve the most bitcoin yield. Our overall capital allocation strategy continues to be focused on increasing our total bitcoins at a rate faster than we issue new shares, which results in higher BTC yield. As Phong mentioned earlier, we are targeting an annual BTC yield of 4% to 8%in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. Having exceeded that already in 2024, we believe those targets are achievable, and also provide transparency in enforcing our goal of consistent, positive BTC yield over time, further differentiating MicroStrategy's value proposition. Lastly, we also announced a 10-for-1 stock split of MicroStrategy's Class A common stock and Class B common stock effected as a stock dividend. This will lead to better accessibility for our investors and employees and create liquidity in our stock as well as in our options activity. The shares are expected to be distributed after the close of trading on August 7, 2024, and trading is expected to commence on its split adjusted basis at the market open on August 8, 2024. The stock dividend will not have any impact on the voting and other rights of stockholders. The next slide lays out our debt maturity profile. As you can see, the conversion of the convertible notes due 2025 has moved the nearest debt maturity out to 2027. We actively monitor the capital markets and evaluate liability management opportunities to manage our debt and interest expense, as well as opportunities to raise additional future financings. MicroStrategy has demonstrated a strong track record of applying a disciplined approach to navigate through volatile times in the bitcoin market, and we believe we have established significant credibility to execute on our strategic goal of generating value for our shareholders. As Phong said earlier, we believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique value proposition for shareholders when compared to other forms of bitcoin exposure. Thank you for your time today, and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Andrew, and thank you to all our shareholders who are with us here today. I would like to give a few thoughts on bitcoin, the macro environment, and MicroStrategy's operations. So, I'm going to start with the Bitcoin Conference 2024. It was extraordinary, and what was very clear is that bitcoin has entered the political conversation; Governors, Senators, House Members, and Presidential Candidates were all in attendance at the conference. There was a Lummis bill presented at the conference. Robert F. Kennedy made some very interesting commitments at the conference. Donald Trump made some very interesting commitments at the conference. Four years ago, all of this was unconceivable. So, we've come a long way in the past four years. Bitcoin has also entered the corporate conversation. During the conference Marathon announced that they're adopting a full hurdle strategy, they acquired additional bitcoin on their balance sheet, and they announced they're not going to sell a bitcoin from their mining activities. Some who are scientific was there at the conference speaking. We have companies like Metaplanet that are very vocally adopting a bitcoin standard. So, lots of conversations and lots of Main Street, Wall Street, and Capital Hill participants, in Nashville. There is a growing consensus that digital, private property is a right, and it's a natural right. Likewise, right to self-custody is rippling throughout all of these speakers and throughout the public, discussion of the public forums. There is also growing enthusiasm for building a strategic bitcoin reserve at various levels. The Lummis bill is a bill to create a strategic bitcoin reserve for the United States government that was announced at the conference, and just rolled out or presented yesterday. The Trump speech was a milestone. He reaffirmed the right to self-custody, and also quite salient was to note that his policy would be to not sell bitcoin. And in terms of the idea of not selling bitcoin elevates bitcoin to be the apex property of the nation as well as the apex investment asset. If the federal government were to cease a building, a farm, a portfolio or big tech stocks, a bunch of ETFs, gold, diamonds, watches, cars, jets and yachts, even though they're valuable, even sports teams, they would sell it. And yet what they won't sell is national parks and bitcoin; two very exciting things. So, bitcoin has really entered the global geopolitical conversation, and Bitcoin Nashville punctuated that. We can go to the next slide. We are still early in bitcoin, but it's worthwhile to make some points about the macro outlook. And as you can see, bitcoin is a $1.3 trillion asset class that makes it one of the 10 most valuable assets in the world, a spot or position that it achieved in 15 years with no marketing, and no management team, and no corporate sponsor. It's quite amazing. And people are beginning to realize just how extraordinary that is. But as you can see, mapped against the map of global vault, and there are many, many different types of global vault maps you can generate, this is one of them. You can see it's not 1% of the global vault in the world. There is a trend. There is on the bitcoin side an institutional adoption trend. We are approaching 40 bitcoin spot ETFs now. And each one of them is solving the problem of compliance, capital controls, and convenience, and custody in Australia, and Hong Kong, and Switzerland, and Brazil, and the United States, and Canada, et cetera. So, those ETFs are not just the marketing distributors of bitcoin, but they're also the custodians, and they're compliance managers of bitcoin. And that's having a pretty big effect. There is also digital transformation taking place, and all of us in the investment community notice it. It was presented in Meta's stock performance in the last day. You can see the impact on Microsoft. You can see the impact on all big tech companies. What's very clear is that AI is going to drive a profound increase in productivity. It's going to drive profound new products, where we can see cars driving themselves, we can see a future of autonomous robots, we can see a future of AI replacing surge, and now just ask the question, you get the answer, and then you'll ask the AI to do the thing for you, and it does it. And in the last 12 months, it's gotten to the point where even non-technical user's eyebrows are raised, and they can extrapolate over the next 10 years and see that this is going to have a profound impact on capital creation. Clearly, the big winners in the corporate world are going to be the big tech companies that can take advantage of AI to create products. And the markets were enthusiastic about Meta, because they can delivery an intelligent AI offering to billions and billions of people instantly. And that being the case, the macro wins, they favor equity, and especially big tech equity, and they favor digital capital, which is what bitcoin is. Over the 20th Century, physical and financial assets, you can imagine that the big tech companies are not going to need so much material or labor-intensive assets, and they're going to want high-speed digital assets. And we've got a number, a handful of trillion-dollar companies. There's going to be a lot more trillion-dollar companies, and those trillion-dollar companies are going to generate capital at an enormous rate, and there's going to be a pressure to put that capital somewhere. And bitcoin has emerged as the primary global digital capital asset. And so, the macro trends are very good. There's going to be increasing excitement as this trend continues. We can go to the next slide. MicroStrategy likes to keep track of its performance. This chart is as of yesterday, market close. So, as we look at the trend yesterday, this is over about four years from August 10, 2020, to close of market July 31, 2024. And what you can see is that traditional financial capital, that is bonds, they're not performing well. There's definitely a lot more money in the system but bonds are minus 18%. Silver is not keeping up. Gold is underperforming. The general cost of capital. S&P and NASDAQ up 60% and 64% respectively, that 60% is effectively the institutional traditional cost of capital for mainstream investors and it works out to divide by four, 12% -- 11%, 12%, 13% compounding per year. Bitcoin has dramatically outperformed that. Bitcoin is up 442% over that same time frame. MicroStrategy's objective was initially to escape the malaise of being a non-big tech company, and then it was to track the bitcoin index, and now it has become to outperform bitcoin. And we're proud to say that we've managed to achieve 1,206% return for our shareholders versus the bitcoin 442% over that time period. Now clearly, we have done that through the use of intelligent leverage and taken advantage of our operating flexibility and Phong and Andrew laid out some of our metrics especially BTC Yield and you can see a company that can generate a BTC Yield or some intelligent leverage has a decent chance of outperforming bitcoin. We've also compared ourselves not just to main asset classes, but we compare ourselves to big tech stocks. And as you can see, big tech stocks that are labor intensive and energy intensive and capital intensive and have a lot of friction in the operations, shipping and energy intensive, they've struggled more. And you see Amazon is up 19%. You can see Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, they all look extraordinarily strong. They've all outperformed the NASDAQ. And those are typically on the tip of people's tongues as the great, strong, big tech performers. And of course, there's one standout, which is Nvidia. And Nvidia has captured the great majority of the AI productivity boost and excitement and enthusiasm. And as I pointed out to people, if you are one of millions and millions of companies and you can copy big tech and copy Apple or Meta or Google or Microsoft or the like, you should, but of course, it's very difficult to do. You could try to copy Nvidia, but as you can see from the chart, even Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Meta are struggling to copy Nvidia. Everybody in the world is asking the question, how do we copy Nvidia and what do we do when this run ends? And I'm proud to say MicroStrategy's outperforming Nvidia over this four years, right, 12.06 versus 9.48. And I'll make the point that we make often, which is, it's not obvious to me how any company copies Nvidia. It's very straightforward to copy MicroStrategy. We've published our corporate playbook. We're happy to explain it to anybody. We do have some companies that are starting to starting to copy us now and we couldn't be pleased or more happier about that. So, we think the bitcoin strategy is the way to go. What we're doing is taking advantage of digital capital. Nvidia is being boosted by digital intelligence. And clearly, every company is going to be profoundly impacted by digital intelligence on their P&L. They can use it to cut their costs, or they can use it to create breakthrough new products, revolutionary products, revolutionary new services, or just dramatically increase the quality of their products and services. And so, of course, every management team is thinking, how do I improve my operations by plugging digital intelligence into my P&L? But our message is, you should also plug digital capital into your balance sheet and as you look at the chart below you can see it most companies are capitalized on bonds and bonds are minus 18% for the past four years and if they were rather capitalized on bitcoin, which is plus 442% that would be a game changer to every company, every public company, every private company and you can see just how much of a game changer it is when you just look at the MicroStrategy results. But we think it's pretty clear. If you have a healthy business, digital capital is going to make it even better. And if you have a cash cow business or if you have a business which is not growing as fast as big tech and fang socks, then digital capital in the form of bitcoin is going to save it. And so, we will continue to pursue a bitcoin strategy, and every quarter we'll keep track of this result. Now we go to the next slide. MicroStrategy is a bitcoin development company. So, how do we intend to move forward? Well, first we'll take advantage of our advantageous corporate structure. We're an operating company. That means we have permanent bitcoin capital, and it also means that we have operational flexibility. And our objective is to outperform spot bitcoin ETPs, they are trust companies. They don't have permanent bitcoin capital. They have to redeem when someone presents the shares for redemption and they don't have therefore that permanent capital base that they can lever. They don't have the operating flexibility that an operating company has. So, the key for us to outperform is to responsibly use that capital and responsibly use our operational flexibility. We also are using our ability to develop software to generate cash flows to build our brand and to make bitcoin successful. We will use our cash flows that we generate in the operating business in order to acquire bitcoin and of course, capital markets is a very important part of our strategy. This last quarter is, as Andrew noted, we used a combination of debt issuance and then convertible issuance and convertible redemption and cash purchases in order to create BTC Yield and in order to acquire bitcoin. We can go to the next slide now. The world is full of bitcoin investors and especially bitcoin Maxi investors. They like bitcoin and they would like to find a way to outperform bitcoin spot ETFs, and they'd like to find a way to get more bitcoin per share. And so, we've created this KPI BTC Yield. We focus on it, right? If we have a chance to do a deal, which would not have a BTC Yield for us, it looks like a bad deal. And when we see a deal that generates a good, a very substantial BTC Yield, well we like that deal. You can see what we've done year-to-date, 12.2% BTC Yield. We are going to run the business such that we can generate a consistent ongoing BTC Yield. As I've said, we've got operating flexibility, we've got bitcoin capital, we also have credibility in the capital markets, and we have experience in the capital markets. So, we'll be continually evaluating various options. And when we see a chance to generate BTC we'll move forward. And if the market isn't offering us something we find compelling, then we'll take our time. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody for their support. And I suppose we can move on to the Q&A.\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. We are now going to jump into questions. And the first question is for Michael. MicroStrategy's equity premium to its bitcoin holdings has remained healthy over the past few months despite the bitcoin price swings and Board directions. Would you attribute this to your ability to achieve a positive BTC Yield?\nMichael Saylor: Yes, I think that long-term bitcoin holders and bitcoin really is the longest duration asset. People that believe in bitcoin are thinking this is apex property, that you do not sell your bitcoin. So, when you have an investment in bitcoin you're not thinking about holding it for a short period of time and flipping it. Now, when you think about holding something for 30 years, or 40 years, and if you have a vehicle like a closed-in fund that charges 250 basis points as a fee; that looks like a negative BTC Yield of 2.5%. We have experience with those sort of things, and we've seen they trade at a discount to net asset value. Closed-in funds with a long fee on an asset you're going to hold forever, they start to look like a multiple of the negative BTC Yield. And on the other hand, if we can get away from that and we can create the opposite, but a positive BTC Yield, we expect that, over time, investors are going to say, \"How much does it cost me, or how much do I benefit from holding my capital in that closed-in fund versus that ETF versus that operating company?\" All things equal, I'd rather have a company that generates plus-250 basis points a year instead of minus-250 basis points a year. The market is going to value our equity based upon their assumptions about the risk and their assumptions about the bitcoin market, and their holding period. And they'll make assumptions about what kind of BTC Yield we can generate and how important that is. And then, they'll put a multiple on it. But I know that, in the debt, our fixed income market, if you have 30-year swap and interest, or a long-dated treasury bond; and interest rates move up, then the bond can trade down and the interest rates move down, the bond can trade up. And, normally, you'll multiply the interest rate change and basis points by a duration number. And it can be long. It can get to 10 to 20 depending upon the bond. And in the equity business, people will look at earnings per share per year or they'll look at whatever accretion they'll get each year, and they'll put a [PD] (ph) multiple on it. If they're enthusiastic, they'll put a high multiple, or if they're skeptical they'll put a low multiple. So, I think that we're trading at a premium to net asset value based upon our shareholders' belief that we can outperform the ETFs that don't have any operating flexibility. And they've been pleased with our capital markets activity, and they've been pleased with our strategy of acquiring bitcoin via various methods. And that represents a differentiated investment for them. So, I think that the BTC Yield is a useful metric to consider. I think that the investors will end up deciding what they over the next decade. But a bitcoin development company should be able to outperform Spot Bitcoin ETF in the form of a trust if the management team is prudent in their measures.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. Next question is for Phong. On the software side, how did you feel about the Q2 cloud conversions relative to your expectations? And how should we think about the rest of the year with respect to your cloud migrations and the AI-related partnerships?\nPhong Le: Thanks, Shirish. We had in Q2, the largest cloud bookings quarter, including conversions that we've had in the history of the company, and by about twofold, a little bit more than twofold. So, the conversions are accelerating, which is great. It's going to help our long-term ARR and our long-term recognized revenue. But as Andrew mentioned, it depresses short-term recognized revenue because it doesn't show up and get recognized in a quarter. It gets recognized readily over the course of the year. So, we had a really good quarter in terms of Cloud conversions. Of course, that helps with the overall health of the business. But the other thing it does is it accelerates the adoption of AI, because our AI products are only available in the cloud. And so, we also saw a big uptick in the purchase and the use of AI in the second quarter. And I think that's going to start to accelerate also. And so, we'll see nice adoption and usage of our first-to-market AI products. So, both of those are positive trends in the business and bode well overall.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Phong. Next question is again for Michael. How does management decide between raising proceeds from debt or equity issuances and whether to use the convertible debt or ATM equity issuances? And how do we think about different options?\nMichael Saylor: Well, we have lots of options. We have options including cash purchases, straight debt, convertible debt, equity, or other types of operational measures that might generate income that we can use to acquire bitcoin. We're continually evaluating the capital markets and the relationship between the options market, the futures market, the bitcoin spot market, our equity market, and then developments in our business and then opportunities we have from various counterparties all go into the mix. This year we did acquire bitcoin with equity issuance, and we thought that that was extremely accretive. Then we did a debt offering and a convertible debt offering. That was extremely accretive. It turns out that the next week, the bitcoin market surge and the convertible market surge and the equity market surge, and we could do another convert offering. That was literally a decision-making process that took place over a matter of days. And so, sometimes in days we'll move when the market offers an opportunity. Then we went ahead and redeemed the 25 note that was in response to the capital markets. The next debt deal in Q2 was a response to the capital markets. We're always going to consider things like the duration of the deal. We consider the nature of the pricing of the deal. We didn't really choose to pursue equity so much in Q2 as we did in Q4 of last year or early Q1 just because the markets are shifting. And the relationship between bitcoin, the options market, the convertible debt market, the fixed income market, the equity market, those are all changing. They literally change. To say they change every quarter is a reasonable statement, but sometimes they change week-by-week and month-by-month. So, I think the great situation we're in is that we don't have to do anything quarter-by-quarter. We can afford to take a quarter off, but we can also, like in Q1, we can do an ATM deal, a convertible debt deal, a second convertible debt deal, and a cash purchase and we can use all four different things and we can do that in a hurry. So, we tend to let the capital markets drive our decision-making by keeping an open mind and being flexible. And what we wanted to do was give our shareholders a useful KPI that helps them understand how we think about a deal that's a good deal to do. We think if we can generate BTC Yield and a substantial BTC Yield, then probably we'll entertain it. If the market is offering us a proposition that looks like a de minimis yield or no yield or negative yield, obviously, we just pass on that.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. I think we have time for one last question, and this is for Andrew. How do you think about the incremental leverage capacity and interest expense capacity given the increased overall interest expense related to the operating cash flows from software business?\nAndrew Kang: Thanks, Shirish, for the question. I guess I'd start by saying we actively manage and forecast our cash. And at the moment we forecast adequate cash to service our existing debt based on the overall software revenues, which continue to remain durable. And as we mentioned before, we're building stronger ARR as we transition to the cloud. We also manage our cash after taking into account a fully funded software business as well as our debt service needs. So, we take the full picture when we're thinking about incremental debt and interest expense. And I just would say we manage it extremely carefully. And keep in mind too, we also have additional sources of liquidity available to us, as Michael mentioned, via the capital markets if needed. And we continually assess various liability management opportunities across the debt stack. That kind of gives us a profile of our needs as well as our capacity. So, overall, I'd say we feel very comfortable with our ability to service the debt. And we'll continue to be active in ways that will continue to generate that BTC Yield KPI that we announced earlier today.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. Thanks, Andrew. So, thank you, everyone, for your questions. And this concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar. I will now hand over the call to Phong for final closing remarks.\nPhong Le: I want to thank everyone for their time today and appreciate all of your support and I look forward to seeing everybody again next quarter. Thanks.",

            "name": "Michael Saylor",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and thank you to all our shareholders who are with us here today. I would like to give a few thoughts on bitcoin, the macro environment, and MicroStrategy's operations. So, I'm going to start with the Bitcoin Conference 2024. It was extraordinary, and what was very clear is that bitcoin has entered the political conversation; Governors, Senators, House Members, and Presidential Candidates were all in attendance at the conference. There was a Lummis bill presented at the conference. Robert F. Kennedy made some very interesting commitments at the conference. Donald Trump made some very interesting commitments at the conference. Four years ago, all of this was unconceivable. So, we've come a long way in the past four years. Bitcoin has also entered the corporate conversation. During the conference Marathon announced that they're adopting a full hurdle strategy, they acquired additional bitcoin on their balance sheet, and they announced they're not going to sell a bitcoin from their mining activities. Some who are scientific was there at the conference speaking. We have companies like Metaplanet that are very vocally adopting a bitcoin standard. So, lots of conversations and lots of Main Street, Wall Street, and Capital Hill participants, in Nashville. There is a growing consensus that digital, private property is a right, and it's a natural right. Likewise, right to self-custody is rippling throughout all of these speakers and throughout the public, discussion of the public forums. There is also growing enthusiasm for building a strategic bitcoin reserve at various levels. The Lummis bill is a bill to create a strategic bitcoin reserve for the United States government that was announced at the conference, and just rolled out or presented yesterday. The Trump speech was a milestone. He reaffirmed the right to self-custody, and also quite salient was to note that his policy would be to not sell bitcoin. And in terms of the idea of not selling bitcoin elevates bitcoin to be the apex property of the nation as well as the apex investment asset. If the federal government were to cease a building, a farm, a portfolio or big tech stocks, a bunch of ETFs, gold, diamonds, watches, cars, jets and yachts, even though they're valuable, even sports teams, they would sell it. And yet what they won't sell is national parks and bitcoin; two very exciting things. So, bitcoin has really entered the global geopolitical conversation, and Bitcoin Nashville punctuated that. We can go to the next slide. We are still early in bitcoin, but it's worthwhile to make some points about the macro outlook. And as you can see, bitcoin is a $1.3 trillion asset class that makes it one of the 10 most valuable assets in the world, a spot or position that it achieved in 15 years with no marketing, and no management team, and no corporate sponsor. It's quite amazing. And people are beginning to realize just how extraordinary that is. But as you can see, mapped against the map of global vault, and there are many, many different types of global vault maps you can generate, this is one of them. You can see it's not 1% of the global vault in the world. There is a trend. There is on the bitcoin side an institutional adoption trend. We are approaching 40 bitcoin spot ETFs now. And each one of them is solving the problem of compliance, capital controls, and convenience, and custody in Australia, and Hong Kong, and Switzerland, and Brazil, and the United States, and Canada, et cetera. So, those ETFs are not just the marketing distributors of bitcoin, but they're also the custodians, and they're compliance managers of bitcoin. And that's having a pretty big effect. There is also digital transformation taking place, and all of us in the investment community notice it. It was presented in Meta's stock performance in the last day. You can see the impact on Microsoft. You can see the impact on all big tech companies. What's very clear is that AI is going to drive a profound increase in productivity. It's going to drive profound new products, where we can see cars driving themselves, we can see a future of autonomous robots, we can see a future of AI replacing surge, and now just ask the question, you get the answer, and then you'll ask the AI to do the thing for you, and it does it. And in the last 12 months, it's gotten to the point where even non-technical user's eyebrows are raised, and they can extrapolate over the next 10 years and see that this is going to have a profound impact on capital creation. Clearly, the big winners in the corporate world are going to be the big tech companies that can take advantage of AI to create products. And the markets were enthusiastic about Meta, because they can delivery an intelligent AI offering to billions and billions of people instantly. And that being the case, the macro wins, they favor equity, and especially big tech equity, and they favor digital capital, which is what bitcoin is. Over the 20th Century, physical and financial assets, you can imagine that the big tech companies are not going to need so much material or labor-intensive assets, and they're going to want high-speed digital assets. And we've got a number, a handful of trillion-dollar companies. There's going to be a lot more trillion-dollar companies, and those trillion-dollar companies are going to generate capital at an enormous rate, and there's going to be a pressure to put that capital somewhere. And bitcoin has emerged as the primary global digital capital asset. And so, the macro trends are very good. There's going to be increasing excitement as this trend continues. We can go to the next slide. MicroStrategy likes to keep track of its performance. This chart is as of yesterday, market close. So, as we look at the trend yesterday, this is over about four years from August 10, 2020, to close of market July 31, 2024. And what you can see is that traditional financial capital, that is bonds, they're not performing well. There's definitely a lot more money in the system but bonds are minus 18%. Silver is not keeping up. Gold is underperforming. The general cost of capital. S&P and NASDAQ up 60% and 64% respectively, that 60% is effectively the institutional traditional cost of capital for mainstream investors and it works out to divide by four, 12% -- 11%, 12%, 13% compounding per year. Bitcoin has dramatically outperformed that. Bitcoin is up 442% over that same time frame. MicroStrategy's objective was initially to escape the malaise of being a non-big tech company, and then it was to track the bitcoin index, and now it has become to outperform bitcoin. And we're proud to say that we've managed to achieve 1,206% return for our shareholders versus the bitcoin 442% over that time period. Now clearly, we have done that through the use of intelligent leverage and taken advantage of our operating flexibility and Phong and Andrew laid out some of our metrics especially BTC Yield and you can see a company that can generate a BTC Yield or some intelligent leverage has a decent chance of outperforming bitcoin. We've also compared ourselves not just to main asset classes, but we compare ourselves to big tech stocks. And as you can see, big tech stocks that are labor intensive and energy intensive and capital intensive and have a lot of friction in the operations, shipping and energy intensive, they've struggled more. And you see Amazon is up 19%. You can see Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Tesla, they all look extraordinarily strong. They've all outperformed the NASDAQ. And those are typically on the tip of people's tongues as the great, strong, big tech performers. And of course, there's one standout, which is Nvidia. And Nvidia has captured the great majority of the AI productivity boost and excitement and enthusiasm. And as I pointed out to people, if you are one of millions and millions of companies and you can copy big tech and copy Apple or Meta or Google or Microsoft or the like, you should, but of course, it's very difficult to do. You could try to copy Nvidia, but as you can see from the chart, even Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Meta are struggling to copy Nvidia. Everybody in the world is asking the question, how do we copy Nvidia and what do we do when this run ends? And I'm proud to say MicroStrategy's outperforming Nvidia over this four years, right, 12.06 versus 9.48. And I'll make the point that we make often, which is, it's not obvious to me how any company copies Nvidia. It's very straightforward to copy MicroStrategy. We've published our corporate playbook. We're happy to explain it to anybody. We do have some companies that are starting to starting to copy us now and we couldn't be pleased or more happier about that. So, we think the bitcoin strategy is the way to go. What we're doing is taking advantage of digital capital. Nvidia is being boosted by digital intelligence. And clearly, every company is going to be profoundly impacted by digital intelligence on their P&L. They can use it to cut their costs, or they can use it to create breakthrough new products, revolutionary products, revolutionary new services, or just dramatically increase the quality of their products and services. And so, of course, every management team is thinking, how do I improve my operations by plugging digital intelligence into my P&L? But our message is, you should also plug digital capital into your balance sheet and as you look at the chart below you can see it most companies are capitalized on bonds and bonds are minus 18% for the past four years and if they were rather capitalized on bitcoin, which is plus 442% that would be a game changer to every company, every public company, every private company and you can see just how much of a game changer it is when you just look at the MicroStrategy results. But we think it's pretty clear. If you have a healthy business, digital capital is going to make it even better. And if you have a cash cow business or if you have a business which is not growing as fast as big tech and fang socks, then digital capital in the form of bitcoin is going to save it. And so, we will continue to pursue a bitcoin strategy, and every quarter we'll keep track of this result. Now we go to the next slide. MicroStrategy is a bitcoin development company. So, how do we intend to move forward? Well, first we'll take advantage of our advantageous corporate structure. We're an operating company. That means we have permanent bitcoin capital, and it also means that we have operational flexibility. And our objective is to outperform spot bitcoin ETPs, they are trust companies. They don't have permanent bitcoin capital. They have to redeem when someone presents the shares for redemption and they don't have therefore that permanent capital base that they can lever. They don't have the operating flexibility that an operating company has. So, the key for us to outperform is to responsibly use that capital and responsibly use our operational flexibility. We also are using our ability to develop software to generate cash flows to build our brand and to make bitcoin successful. We will use our cash flows that we generate in the operating business in order to acquire bitcoin and of course, capital markets is a very important part of our strategy. This last quarter is, as Andrew noted, we used a combination of debt issuance and then convertible issuance and convertible redemption and cash purchases in order to create BTC Yield and in order to acquire bitcoin. We can go to the next slide now. The world is full of bitcoin investors and especially bitcoin Maxi investors. They like bitcoin and they would like to find a way to outperform bitcoin spot ETFs, and they'd like to find a way to get more bitcoin per share. And so, we've created this KPI BTC Yield. We focus on it, right? If we have a chance to do a deal, which would not have a BTC Yield for us, it looks like a bad deal. And when we see a deal that generates a good, a very substantial BTC Yield, well we like that deal. You can see what we've done year-to-date, 12.2% BTC Yield. We are going to run the business such that we can generate a consistent ongoing BTC Yield. As I've said, we've got operating flexibility, we've got bitcoin capital, we also have credibility in the capital markets, and we have experience in the capital markets. So, we'll be continually evaluating various options. And when we see a chance to generate BTC we'll move forward. And if the market isn't offering us something we find compelling, then we'll take our time. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody for their support. And I suppose we can move on to the Q&A. Yes, I think that long-term bitcoin holders and bitcoin really is the longest duration asset. People that believe in bitcoin are thinking this is apex property, that you do not sell your bitcoin. So, when you have an investment in bitcoin you're not thinking about holding it for a short period of time and flipping it. Now, when you think about holding something for 30 years, or 40 years, and if you have a vehicle like a closed-in fund that charges 250 basis points as a fee; that looks like a negative BTC Yield of 2.5%. We have experience with those sort of things, and we've seen they trade at a discount to net asset value. Closed-in funds with a long fee on an asset you're going to hold forever, they start to look like a multiple of the negative BTC Yield. And on the other hand, if we can get away from that and we can create the opposite, but a positive BTC Yield, we expect that, over time, investors are going to say, \"How much does it cost me, or how much do I benefit from holding my capital in that closed-in fund versus that ETF versus that operating company?\" All things equal, I'd rather have a company that generates plus-250 basis points a year instead of minus-250 basis points a year. The market is going to value our equity based upon their assumptions about the risk and their assumptions about the bitcoin market, and their holding period. And they'll make assumptions about what kind of BTC Yield we can generate and how important that is. And then, they'll put a multiple on it. But I know that, in the debt, our fixed income market, if you have 30-year swap and interest, or a long-dated treasury bond; and interest rates move up, then the bond can trade down and the interest rates move down, the bond can trade up. And, normally, you'll multiply the interest rate change and basis points by a duration number. And it can be long. It can get to 10 to 20 depending upon the bond. And in the equity business, people will look at earnings per share per year or they'll look at whatever accretion they'll get each year, and they'll put a [PD] (ph) multiple on it. If they're enthusiastic, they'll put a high multiple, or if they're skeptical they'll put a low multiple. So, I think that we're trading at a premium to net asset value based upon our shareholders' belief that we can outperform the ETFs that don't have any operating flexibility. And they've been pleased with our capital markets activity, and they've been pleased with our strategy of acquiring bitcoin via various methods. And that represents a differentiated investment for them. So, I think that the BTC Yield is a useful metric to consider. I think that the investors will end up deciding what they over the next decade. But a bitcoin development company should be able to outperform Spot Bitcoin ETF in the form of a trust if the management team is prudent in their measures. Well, we have lots of options. We have options including cash purchases, straight debt, convertible debt, equity, or other types of operational measures that might generate income that we can use to acquire bitcoin. We're continually evaluating the capital markets and the relationship between the options market, the futures market, the bitcoin spot market, our equity market, and then developments in our business and then opportunities we have from various counterparties all go into the mix. This year we did acquire bitcoin with equity issuance, and we thought that that was extremely accretive. Then we did a debt offering and a convertible debt offering. That was extremely accretive. It turns out that the next week, the bitcoin market surge and the convertible market surge and the equity market surge, and we could do another convert offering. That was literally a decision-making process that took place over a matter of days. And so, sometimes in days we'll move when the market offers an opportunity. Then we went ahead and redeemed the 25 note that was in response to the capital markets. The next debt deal in Q2 was a response to the capital markets. We're always going to consider things like the duration of the deal. We consider the nature of the pricing of the deal. We didn't really choose to pursue equity so much in Q2 as we did in Q4 of last year or early Q1 just because the markets are shifting. And the relationship between bitcoin, the options market, the convertible debt market, the fixed income market, the equity market, those are all changing. They literally change. To say they change every quarter is a reasonable statement, but sometimes they change week-by-week and month-by-month. So, I think the great situation we're in is that we don't have to do anything quarter-by-quarter. We can afford to take a quarter off, but we can also, like in Q1, we can do an ATM deal, a convertible debt deal, a second convertible debt deal, and a cash purchase and we can use all four different things and we can do that in a hurry. So, we tend to let the capital markets drive our decision-making by keeping an open mind and being flexible. And what we wanted to do was give our shareholders a useful KPI that helps them understand how we think about a deal that's a good deal to do. We think if we can generate BTC Yield and a substantial BTC Yield, then probably we'll entertain it. If the market is offering us a proposition that looks like a de minimis yield or no yield or negative yield, obviously, we just pass on that."

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you, Phong. I'll continue with the recap of our software financial results, and then I'll move on to our bitcoin strategy. Total revenues for the second quarter were $111.4 million, down 7% year-over-year. Consistent with recent quarters, the overall revenue trend reflects the transition of our business from on-premise to cloud. As we migrate customers to the cloud, we shift upfront product license revenues to subscription services revenues, which are recognized readily over the life of a contract. As a result, we fully expect product license revenues, along with support revenues to decline, both of which were down 40% and down 7% respectively year-over-year. What isn't immediately seen through reported revenue is that we are building up stronger, more durable cloud recurring revenue that comes in over time, which is consistent for any on-prem to cloud transition. And more robust or faster cloud migrations will have a larger, but temporary reduction in upfront revenues, which is what we saw in last quarter's results. The cloud contracts booked in Q2 were the strongest single quarter bookings we have seen to date, more than double Q1 or any prior quarter for that matter. This acceleration last quarter makes up for the lower than expected cloud contracts we closed in Q1, meets and beats last year's quarters targets, and directly reflects the transition starting to take shape. While we'll see the initial benefits of last quarter's strong cloud migrations float through revenue beginning next quarter, the lower product license bookings in 2024 will result in lower than expected recognized revenue for the full-year by somewhere between 4% and 5%. Overall total annual revenues have been generally flat in the past couple of years, but with our transition beginning to take shape in the first-half of this year, we expect to see similar patterns in total revenue going forward as we execute on our transformation. This year and potentially in 2025 should reflect the transition point in our long-term strategy, and exiting the next 12 to 18 months we should start seeing total revenues begin to grow again. Non-GAAP subscription billings, which represent cloud revenues in the quarter along with just the next 12 months of deferred subscription services revenues, grew by 45% last quarter to $33.4 million, our fourth straight year of quarterly double-digit growth. Q2 subscription services revenues increased 21% year-over-year, which represents the recognized revenue from previously booked cloud contracts, now make up approximately 22% of total revenues. Subscription services revenues are now larger than our product license revenues and will continue to grow each quarter while product license will decline further from here on out. In Q1, we enhanced our reported numbers to break out our quarterly results into two categories. First, the software business category reflects income or loss from operations related specifically to our BI business. The corporate and other category represents the non-software-related areas associated with our digital asset holdings, which include impairment charges and other related third-party costs. While we continue to operate under one reportable operating segment, we believe the breakout of our operating results into these two categories provides more transparency with respect to the performance of our software business while isolating the impacts related to changes in bitcoin price. In Q2, software business revenues were $111 million that I mentioned a moment ago, while cost of revenues were $31 million, up 14% compared to Q2 of last year. The increase was in part due to higher cloud hosting costs, which is a direct result of our growing cloud business, as well as costs associated with setting up enhancing customer success functions. Software business operating expenses were $99 million, up 4% compared to Q2 of last year. Higher G&A this quarter was related to higher stock-based comp, legal, consulting, and other advisory costs, as well as higher employer payroll taxes in connection with employee stock option exercises in the second quarter. However, overall operating expenses were also offset by lower costs in sales and marketing, consistent with recent quarters, as we maintain strong discipline in expense and cost management. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense in Q2 was $20.6 million, up 33% year-over-year, and overall non-GAAP operating income or profit from the software business category was $1.9 million. Lastly, the corporate and other operating expense category for the quarter was $182 million compared to $25 million in Q2 of last year, $180 million of which was due to bitcoin impairment in the last quarter. Now, turning to our bitcoin strategy, we had another extremely successful quarter of adding more bitcoin to our balance sheet, as we acquired 12,053 bitcoins in the second quarter, and as of July 31st, the company held a total of 226,500 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion or approximately $36,800 per coin. Currently, we hold 175,721 unencumbered bitcoins at MacroStrategy, the wholly-owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy, which represents 78% of our total holdings or $11.4 billion in current market value, all of which are currently unrestricted and unencumbered. The bitcoin we acquired using proceeds from our convertible notes offering in Q2 are held at MicroStrategy, the parent, and serve as collateral securing our 2028 senior secured notes. During Q2, we added 11,931 bitcoins to MicroStrategy's holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $786 million using net proceeds from our convertible note issuance. Additionally, bitcoins purchased using excess cash from the software business are also held at MicroStrategy, the parent, which also serve to collateralize our 2028 senior secured notes. During Q2, we added 122 bitcoins to MicroStrategy's holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $8 million from excess cash. Since the end of Q2, we added an additional 169 bitcoins to MicroStrategy holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $11 million, also using proceeds from excess cash. As of July 31st, 50,779 bitcoins are held at MicroStrategy or $3.3 billion in current market value. The commitment to our bitcoin strategy remains stronger than ever. We have added bitcoin to our treasury in every quarter since August 2020, and as a result, MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world. As we continue to champion bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset, we are deeply encouraged by the growing number of both public and private companies that are adopting the bitcoin standard to help grow shareholder value. As of June 30, 2024, the market value of our bitcoin holdings was $14 billion, and an aggregate cost of $8.3 billion equal to an average purchase price of approximately $36,800. This is in contrast to the carrying value of our bitcoin holdings of $5.7 billion as of the last day of the quarter. We fully plan to adopt the new FASB accounting rule, which requires fair value treatment for bitcoin holdings by Q1 of next year when the rule takes effect, at which time we will realize the benefit of the significant difference between the market value and the carrying value of our balance sheet. Now, turning to our capital markets activities, since the inception of our bitcoin strategy, we have issued $4.4 billion of debt through senior secured notes and convertible notes. We now have $3.8 billion of outstanding debt with a very low blended interest rate of approximately 1.6%, with staggered maturities over several years starting in February 2027 through June 2032. Intelligent leverage remains a key component of our active capital allocation strategy, which when deployed in a thoughtful manner enables us to add more bitcoin to our treasury reserve at an attractive cost and with a disciplined approach to maximizing BTC yield. Continuing with the momentum from the two convertible note financings in March, our recent convert in June was upsized and well-received by the market. We issued $800 million of convertible notes due June 2032 at an annual interest rate of 2.25%, with a conversion premium of 35% and a conversion price of approximately $2,043 per share. As in the past, the net proceeds from the new convert were used to acquire additional bitcoin into our treasury reserve. We will continue to actively manage our existing liabilities and to that end, we called for redemption of our $650 million 2025 convertible notes. As the notes were substantially in the money, holders of those notes converted substantially all of the notes into shares of our Class A common stock prior to the redemption date. Our 2025 notes traded up over 300% from time of issuance, resulting in an extremely successful investment for our bond investors and partners. In addition to raising debt, we continue to demonstrate a solid track record of issuing equity in a manner that is accretive to shareholders. Today we announced that we filed a new shelf registration for $2 billion At-The-Market or ATM equity offering. We will remain extremely disciplined in the use of both the ATM and other capital markets activities executing on them when we believe that will achieve the most bitcoin yield. Our overall capital allocation strategy continues to be focused on increasing our total bitcoins at a rate faster than we issue new shares, which results in higher BTC yield. As Phong mentioned earlier, we are targeting an annual BTC yield of 4% to 8%in each of 2025, 2026 and 2027. Having exceeded that already in 2024, we believe those targets are achievable, and also provide transparency in enforcing our goal of consistent, positive BTC yield over time, further differentiating MicroStrategy's value proposition. Lastly, we also announced a 10-for-1 stock split of MicroStrategy's Class A common stock and Class B common stock effected as a stock dividend. This will lead to better accessibility for our investors and employees and create liquidity in our stock as well as in our options activity. The shares are expected to be distributed after the close of trading on August 7, 2024, and trading is expected to commence on its split adjusted basis at the market open on August 8, 2024. The stock dividend will not have any impact on the voting and other rights of stockholders. The next slide lays out our debt maturity profile. As you can see, the conversion of the convertible notes due 2025 has moved the nearest debt maturity out to 2027. We actively monitor the capital markets and evaluate liability management opportunities to manage our debt and interest expense, as well as opportunities to raise additional future financings. MicroStrategy has demonstrated a strong track record of applying a disciplined approach to navigate through volatile times in the bitcoin market, and we believe we have established significant credibility to execute on our strategic goal of generating value for our shareholders. As Phong said earlier, we believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique value proposition for shareholders when compared to other forms of bitcoin exposure. Thank you for your time today, and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks. Thanks, Shirish, for the question. I guess I'd start by saying we actively manage and forecast our cash. And at the moment we forecast adequate cash to service our existing debt based on the overall software revenues, which continue to remain durable. And as we mentioned before, we're building stronger ARR as we transition to the cloud. We also manage our cash after taking into account a fully funded software business as well as our debt service needs. So, we take the full picture when we're thinking about incremental debt and interest expense. And I just would say we manage it extremely carefully. And keep in mind too, we also have additional sources of liquidity available to us, as Michael mentioned, via the capital markets if needed. And we continually assess various liability management opportunities across the debt stack. That kind of gives us a profile of our needs as well as our capacity. So, overall, I'd say we feel very comfortable with our ability to service the debt. And we'll continue to be active in ways that will continue to generate that BTC Yield KPI that we announced earlier today."

            "content": "Thank you, Shirish. Hello everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar. As we discussed in the last two quarters, MicroStrategy considers itself to be the world's first bitcoin development company. We're a publicly traded operating company committed to the continued development of the bitcoin network through our activities in the financial markets, advocacy, and technology innovation. As an operating business, we're able to use cash flows, as well as proceeds from equity and debt financings to accumulate bitcoin, which serves as our primary treasury reserve asset. We believe that the combination of our operating structure, bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for value creation. Being an operating company, our Software Technology business remains our core revenue and cash flow generator. In addition, it also enables us to acquire bitcoin thorough the use of excess cash or proceeds from equity capital raises or corporate debt capital raises. These capital market levers allow us to deploy intelligent leverage to increase our bitcoin holdings in a manner which we believe has created shareholder value. Since our adoption of our bitcoin strategy, we have used three primary mechanisms to acquire more bitcoin. Cash flows from software orations; since August, 2020, we've invested $836 million of total cash in our balance sheet. Equity issuances; we have issued $3.2 billion in equity in a manner that we believe to be accretive to existing shareholders; and debt financing, we had $3.8 billion in debt outstanding through the issuance of both Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Notes. We've used the proceeds from these issuances, principally, to purchase bitcoin. The blended cost of our outstanding debt is fixed at 1.6% annually. Turning to the bitcoin highlights for Q2 2024, MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of bitcoin in the world, now holding 226,500 bitcoins, with a total bitcoin market value at $15 billion as of yesterday. Since March 31, 2024, we acquired an additional 12,222 bitcoin for a total purchase cost of $805 million, an average price of $65,882. Year-to-date 2024, the price of bitcoin has appreciated, spurred notably by the approval of the Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Products, or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention. We believe the introduction and initial success of the Spot Bitcoin ETPs evidences the maturation of bitcoin as an institution-grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption. We attended the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, in Nashville, last week, and we saw tremendous support for the bitcoin ecosystem, from policymakers, bipartisan politicians, institutions, businesses, and individuals. It's very encouraging to see high-profile institutions and individuals showing interest in bitcoin, and starting to appreciate the importance of this asset class as a part of their portfolios. MicroStrategy remains highly committed to our bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus. Michael will further elaborate later with his thoughts and takeaways from the Bitcoin 2024 Conference. On the capital markets front, we made significant progress towards the advancement of our bitcoin development company strategy. In June, we raised $800 million through 2032 maturity convertible notes, called for our $650 million 2025 convertible notes, announced 10:1 stock split, and announced a $2 billion at-the-market, or ATM, equity offering program. Andrew will further provide details on our capital markets and bitcoin purchase activity for this quarter. As a bitcoin development company, we have the unique ability to access the capital markets to create intelligent leverage. During the first and second quarter of 2024, our total bitcoin holdings increased by 13.3% and 5.6%, respectively. During the same periods, our assumed diluted shares outstanding increased by only 4.8% and 1.8%, respectively. When we refer to assumed diluted shares outstanding, we're assuming all outstanding convertible notes or fully converted at the respective conversion prices. All outstanding options are fully exercised. And all restricted stock units and performance stock units fully vest, in each case without regard to exercise or conversion price or investing or other contractual conditions. Our opportunistic use of leverage and excess cash to acquire bitcoin, as well as our strategic execution of our capital markets' financings resulted in an incremental value creation for our shareholders. Our objective is to accumulate bitcoin holdings at a faster rate than we issue shares. And we believe we have a demonstrated track record of doing so. To assess our performance in achieving this strategic objective, we're introducing a new key performance indicator which we refer to as BTC Yield. We define BTC Yield as the period-to-period percentage change in the ratio of our total bitcoin holdings to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. We use this KPI to help assess the achievement of our strategic objective and for evaluating capital allocation decisions. If we increase our total bitcoin holding over a given period at a faster pace than we increased our assumed diluted shares outstanding, we achieve a positive bitcoin yield. I should note here that bitcoin yield is not equivalent to yield in the traditional financial context. It's simply just a measure of the percentage change, period-to-period, in the ratio of our bitcoin holdings to our assumed diluted shares outstanding. In addition, when we use Bitcoin Yield, we consider the various limitations of this metric, including that it assumes that all indebtedness will be refinanced or, in the case of our convertible notes, converted into shares of common stock at their respective conversion prices. And it does not take into account debt and other liabilities. Although bitcoin yield is not actually a yield in the traditional finance context, we internally think about this metric as some might think about a bond yield or a yield on another financial instrument. It's obviously an imperfect analogy, but we look to the metric to help us assess how we are doing on using our capital most efficiently to increase our bitcoin holdings over time. The historical performance of this KPI is shown on this slide. We achieved an annual bitcoin yield of 47.3% in 2021, 1.8% in 2023, and 7.3% in 2023. We've achieved quarterly bitcoin yield of 8.1% in Q1, and 3.7% in Q2, surpassing the annual bitcoin yield in 2023 as of the year-to-date 2024. We're able to achieve this through the acquisition of bitcoin using our excess cash flows and proceeds from debt and equity financings, which we believe were accretive to shareholders. Management uses Bitcoin Yield to evaluate capital allocation decisions, and to measure the achievement of our bitcoin strategy. Our strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner we believe to be accretive to shareholders, thereby achieving bitcoin yield, sets us apart from institutional bitcoin investment options that charge a management fee, and we therefore achieve a negative bitcoin yield as we measure it. Building on our previous discussion, we have a clear strategy to enhance our bitcoin holdings and deliver a positive annual bitcoin yield. Today, we are announcing our target to achieve a bitcoin yield of 4% to 8% per year for the next three years in 2025, 2026, and 2027. Our approach includes accumulating more bitcoin holdings by 1, using the organic excess cash flows generated by our software business 2, using proceeds from equity offerings when we believe accretive and 3, responsibly using the Intelligent Leverage Framework with a risk-managed approach. We will continue to use the full spectrum of financing options and also explore creative capital market transactions and untapped pools of capital to execute this strategy effectively and prudently. By sharing our three-year KPI targets, we are reinforcing our goal of achieving consistent positive bitcoin yield over time. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of institutional bitcoin adoption, and as we look into the future, we anticipate that our ability to consistently achieve positive bitcoin yield will become a crucial benchmark for investors to assess our execution of our strategy. Turning to the software business, MicroStrategy is also positioned as the world's largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company. In the second quarter of 2024, we continued our shift towards our cloud offering, resulting in subscription services revenue of $24 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. The strong growth in our subscription services revenue was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer renewal rates continue to remain high and our non-GAAP subscription billings remain strong. Overall, we see strong demand for our cloud platform and Q2 was a particularly strong quarter for customers migrating to cloud. Our objective continues to be growing cloud revenue by migrating customers to cloud while maintaining profitability. At our MicroStrategy World User Conference held in Las Vegas in May 2024, we showcased how MicroStrategy ONE with AI can create more innovative, competitive, high-performing organizations. In our keynote address, we highlighted how some of the biggest brands in the world, including organizations like Lori, Bayer, and the U.S. Department of State, leverage our platform to successfully utilize their data and combat the big data stupor and application sprawl. We unveiled Auto Express to offer an easy and insightful way to engage with MicroStrategy AI, allowing users to build their own standalone AI BI bot without a single line of code. Earlier this year, MicroStrategy ONE became available on the Google Cloud Marketplace, in addition to prior deployments on Azure and AWS, allowing enterprises to easily find and deploy this cloud-native platform. Customers can benefit from a wide range of innovative, first-to-market AI-powered functionality, powered by the Azure OpenAI LLM. Transitioning our customer base to the technology of the future remains a key focus, and our hyperscaler partners are a key part of this migration. As customers and prospects move to the cloud to empower their AI-driven digital transformations, we expect to continue to see a decrease in product license revenues and support revenues, which will in part be offset by increases in subscription services revenues. This will be most pronounced in the balance of 2024. This may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short term, but in the long run, we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenue. Additional benefits include more engaged customers using our very latest software, higher retention rates, and ultimately, growing recurring and overall revenues. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail. Thanks, Shirish. We had in Q2, the largest cloud bookings quarter, including conversions that we've had in the history of the company, and by about twofold, a little bit more than twofold. So, the conversions are accelerating, which is great. It's going to help our long-term ARR and our long-term recognized revenue. But as Andrew mentioned, it depresses short-term recognized revenue because it doesn't show up and get recognized in a quarter. It gets recognized readily over the course of the year. So, we had a really good quarter in terms of Cloud conversions. Of course, that helps with the overall health of the business. But the other thing it does is it accelerates the adoption of AI, because our AI products are only available in the cloud. And so, we also saw a big uptick in the purchase and the use of AI in the second quarter. And I think that's going to start to accelerate also. And so, we'll see nice adoption and usage of our first-to-market AI products. So, both of those are positive trends in the business and bode well overall. I want to thank everyone for their time today and appreciate all of your support and I look forward to seeing everybody again next quarter. Thanks."

Also, for the first time, we will livestream our World Keynote, as well as all the Bitcoin for Corporation sessions. For those of you attending the conference here in Las Vegas, we look forward to seeing you in person. Turning to the business highlights for Q1 2024. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, now holding 214,400 Bitcoin with a total Bitcoin market value of $14 billion as of yesterday. Since December 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 25,250 Bitcoin for a total purchase cost of $1.6 billion at an average price of $65,232. This past quarter, the price of Bitcoin appreciated significantly, spurred notably by the approval of the spot Bitcoin exchange traded products or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention. We believe the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETPs further evidences the maturation of Bitcoin as an institutional grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption. We remain highly committed to our Bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus. Andrew will provide further details on our Bitcoin purchase activity for this quarter. MicroStrategy is also positioned as the world's largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company. Our objective to grow in AI, our objective is to grow in AI and cloud powered BI software. We have over 1,800 employees focused on our software business, devoted to achieving our vision of intelligence everywhere. In the first quarter of 2024, we continued our shift towards our cloud offering, resulting in subscription services revenues of $23 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year. A strong growth in our subscription services revenue was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer renewal rate continues to remain high and our subscription billings remain strong. Overall, we continue to see further global adoption of our cloud platform as a result of transitioning our business strategy and product offerings from an on-prem perpetual licensed software company to a cloud native profitability. Our key strategic goals in 2024 are to grow cloud, innovate with AI, and increase profitability. Customers can benefit from a range of innovative first to market AI powered functionality, powered by the Azure, OpenAI, LLM. Capabilities include Auto SQL, which allows users to generate SQL using natural language, auto dashboard, which allows natural language generation of new visualizations. Auto Answers, which allows customers to ask questions of their datasets and dashboards, Auto Expert which allows users to ask questions of our MicroStrategy knowledge base and log support tickets on our website and our custom Auto Bot, which enables end users to access BI insights from within a custom bot, stand alone or embedded in any application. We also just launched Auto Express, which offers a simple way to trial our AI capabilities in minutes. In April, MicroStrategy one became available on Google Cloud Marketplace in addition to prior deployments on Azure and AWS, allowing enterprises to easily find and deploy this cloud native platform. Additionally, we expect to provide the ability to deploy MicroStrategy in a private cloud later this year. This will distinguish us from other BI platforms with the flexibility and automation that enterprise customers desire. We believe such investment and capability will encourage current on-prem customers to embrace the benefits of MicroStrategy. Cloud, such as containerized architecture, proactive cloud management from experts, seamless backups and single click updates. Transitioning our customer base to the technology of the future remains a key focus, and our resource deployment underscores our commitment to the cloud first approach. As customers and prospects move to the cloud to empower their AI-driven digital transformations, we expect to see a continued decrease in product license revenues, which will in part be offset by increases in subscription services revenues. This will be most pronounced in the balance of 2024. This may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short-term, but in the long run, we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenue. Additional benefits include more engaged customer is using our very latest software, higher retention rates, and ultimately more recurring revenue. As we discussed last quarter, MicroStrategy considers itself to be the world's first Bitcoin development company. We are a publicly traded operating company committed to the continued development of the Bitcoin network throughout our activities in the financial markets, advocacy and technology innovation. As an operating business, we are able to use cash flows, as well as proceeds from equity and debt financing in this to accumulate Bitcoin, which serves as our primary treasury reserve asset. We also bring our enterprise analytics software development capabilities to develop Bitcoin applications. We believe that the combination of our operating structure, Bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for value creation. Being an operating company, our software technology business remains our core revenue and cash flow generator. In addition, it also enables us to acquire Bitcoin through the use of excess cash or proceeds from equity capital raises or corporate debt capital raises. These capital market levers allow us to deploy intelligent leverage to increase our Bitcoin holdings in a manner, which we believe has created shareholder value. Since our adoption of our Bitcoin strategy, we've used three primary mechanisms to acquire more Bitcoin: cash flows from software operations. Since 2020, we've invested $825 million of total cash on our balance sheet. Equity issuances, we have issued $3.2 billion in equity in a manner that we believe to be accretive to existing shareholders. And debt financing, we've issued $3.6 billion in debt through the issuance of both senior secured notes and convertible notes. We've used the proceeds from these issuances principally to purchase Bitcoin. The blended cost of our outstanding debt is fixed at 1.3% annually. In the first quarter of 2024, we generated approximately $7.2 billion of incremental value from the effect of increases in the price of Bitcoin on our existing Bitcoin holdings, as well as our strategic use of equity and debt capital market activities. We began the year with 189,150 Bitcoin holdings with a market value of approximately $8 billion. As Bitcoin prices increased from $42,500 to $71,000 by the end of the first quarter, we experienced an increase of $5.4 billion in value based on our Bitcoin Holdings at the start of the year. In addition to the incremental value from their price appreciation of the Bitcoin we held as of the beginning of the year, we purchased an additional $1.6 billion of Bitcoin in the first quarter using proceeds from the issuance of additional equity and two convertible senior note offerings, as well as excess cash from operations. As a result, we added an additional 25,128 Bitcoin to our holdings at an average price of roughly $65,200, which generated an incremental approximately $145 million of value from an increase in the price of Bitcoin after those purchases were made through the end of Q1. Overall, 2024 started off as a tremendously successful year taking into account our Bitcoin purchases and appreciation of our Bitcoin holdings year-to-date. While the overall market benefited from the increase in Bitcoin price as well, we believe our opportunistic use of leverage and excess cash to acquire Bitcoin, as well as our capital market strategy generated $1.8 billion of incremental shareholder value, demonstrating our track record of generating value for our shareholders. This slide shows an illustrative example of how intelligent leverage can be used to boost returns when Bitcoin prices are increasing. The baseline returns of any long Bitcoin strategy from spot Bitcoin price appreciation. Bitcoin ETPs also benefit from this, offset by the management fees that are charged for those products. Leverage provides the opportunity to generate higher returns if the price increases. In this illustration, assuming Bitcoin price reaches $250,000 keeping Bitcoin count constant, spot Bitcoin without leverage would return approximately 290%. In this example, adding leverage to acquire more Bitcoin would return between approximately 395% to 425% depending on the amount of leverage, further boosting returns compared to simply holding the spot Bitcoin. If the market value of our bitcoin increases, we believe this would create more opportunities to manage our leverage targets. With the opportunity to take on more leverage in a prudent risk managed fashion, the value generated from our increasing Bitcoin holdings would be expected to outperform even further if Bitcoin prices continue to rise. We believe our unique value proposition as the world's first Bitcoin development company has enabled us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail.\nAndrew Kang: Thank you, Phong. I'll, start with first, a recap of our software financial results. For the Q1, total revenues were a $115.2 million, which was down about 5% year-over-year. Consistent with prior recent quarters, the slight decline remains in part due to our ongoing shift, of revenue from on-prem to cloud. Q1 on-prem product license revenues, which make up about 11% of total revenue, were about $12.900 million, which is down 26% year-over-year. As I mentioned in prior calls, we continue to transition our business to the cloud, and we fully anticipate lower product license revenues to continue as we migrate existing customers off on-prem licenses and bring them on to the cloud. More importantly, as Phong mentioned earlier, we continue to grow subscription services revenues, which reflects stronger, more durable recurring software revenue. In Q1, subscription services revenues, which now make up about 20% of total revenues, were $23 million, which reflects an increase of 22% year-over-year. Non-GAAP subscription billings, which represent new cloud bookings in the quarter, also grew by 30% in the Q1 to $17.7 million, which was our fourth straight year of quarterly double-digit growth in cloud bookings. Q4 last year was an important milestone for us in the progress toward cloud transition, where for the first time, our subscription services revenues were higher than our product license revenues. This successful trend continued in the first quarter of 2024, which reflects the ongoing progress towards converting our revenue to recurring subscription services. The mix of revenue will continue to shift from on-premise product license to subscription services throughout 2024, as we focus on delivering meaningful AI-based products to our customers, which is only available in the cloud. We are pleased with the progress we have made from the adoption from our customers to our cloud platform worldwide, and we still have more to do, and we'll continue to focus on new products and innovation to drive more demand in that space. Beginning with the first quarter of 2024, we modified our reported financials to break out our quarterly results into two categories: First, the software business category reflects income or loss from operations related distinctly to our enterprise BI software business. And the corporate and other category reflects the other non-software related components associated with our digital asset holdings, which include impairment charges and other related third-party costs. While we continue to operate under one reportable operating segment, which is engaged in design, development, and sales of our software platform through licensing arrangements, cloud subscriptions, and related services, we believe this breakout of our operating results into these two categories provides better transparency with respect to the performance of our software business, while isolating the impacts related to changes in Bitcoin prices. In Q1, the software business revenues were $115 million as mentioned a moment ago, while the cost of revenues were $30 million up 7.4%, compared to Q1 of last year. The increase in costs were in part due to higher cloud hosting, a result of higher usage by new and existing cloud subscription services customers. It was also attributed to costs associated with standing up an enhanced customer success function with an added focus on transitioning customers to our cloud platform, in addition to servicing and managing our strong existing customer base. Software business operating expenses were $96.1 million, up 1.7%, compared to $94.5 million in Q1 of last year. The increase was primarily due to higher G&A expenses this quarter, which was specifically related to an increase in employer payroll taxes in connect with employee stock option exercises in the Q1. However, overall operating expenses were also offset by lower costs in sales, marketing, and R&D, also consistent with recent quarters as we maintain strong discipline in expenses and we continue to optimize overall headcount. Non-cash, stock based compensation expense was mostly flat year-over-year at $17.8 million for the quarter. And overall non-GAAP adjusted operating income or profit from the software business category was $6.9 million. If you take into account the employer paid payroll taxes related to stock option exercises in Q1, which were not material in prior periods, non-GAAP adjusted operating income from the core software business would have reflected $14.3 million for the first quarter, more appropriately reflecting the quarter's profitability from our software business. Lastly, the corporate and other operating expense category for the quarter is almost entirely attributable to Bitcoin impairment charges, which were $192 million, compared to $20 million in Q1 of last year, the result of Bitcoin price fluctuations throughout this past quarter. Turning to our Bitcoin strategy more specifically, we had one of the most successful quarters of adding more Bitcoin to our balance sheet, as we acquired 25,128 Bitcoins in the first quarter, our second largest single quarter increase in Bitcoin Holdings since Q4 2020. Additionally, after the end of first quarter, we purchased an additional 122 Bitcoins using $8 million of excess cash. And as of April 26, 2024, the company held a total of 214,400 Bitcoins acquired from an aggregate cost of $7.54 billion or $35,180 per Bitcoin. To break down the Bitcoin acquisition activity year-to-date by entity, Bitcoin acquired the proceeds from equity capital markets activities that occurred after the issuance of our senior secured notes are held at MacroStrategy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy. Year-to-date, we have added 2,652 Bitcoins to MacroStrategy's Holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $137 million using net proceeds from our at the market or ATM equity issuance programs in February. Currently, we hold 175,721 unencumbered Bitcoins, representing 82% of our total holdings or $11.2 billion incurred market value, which are held at MacroStrategy. These are all unrestricted and provide the option to potentially leverage this strategic asset in the future. Bitcoin's acquired through proceeds from debt activities that occurred after the issuance of our senior secured notes, namely the two recent convertible note issuances in Q1 are held at MicroStrategy, the parent, and also serve as collateral securing our 2028 senior secured notes. Year-to-date, we have added 20,180 Bitcoins to MicroStrategy's holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion using net proceeds from our two convertible note issuances in March. Lastly, Bitcoins purchased through excess cash from the software business are also held at MicroStrategy, the parent entity, and also collateralize our 2028 senior secured notes. Year-to-date we have added 2,418 Bitcoins to MicroStrategy's Holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $136 million using proceeds from excess cash. As of April 26, there are in total 38,679 Bitcoins held at MicroStrategy or $2.4 billion in current market value. Our commitment to our Bitcoin strategy remains unchanged and steadfast, and we plan to strategically and opportunistically buy more Bitcoin as we have in every quarter since August of 2020 using excess cash from operations and proceeds from any capital markets activities. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, and we remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with the utmost conviction, long-term focus, and with a strong risk managed approach. As a Bitcoin development company, the unique ability to access the capital markets and the positive impact from using intelligent leverage are illustrated on this slide. During the first quarter of 2024, our total Bitcoin Holdings increased by 13.3%. During the same period, our total basic share count comprised of total basic Class A shares outstanding and total basic Class B shares outstanding increased by only 4.6%. This is in part due to the deferred dilution impact of leveraging convertible debt and our opportunistic execution of these financings, which has resulted in tremendous value creation for our shareholders. The difference between our Bitcoin accretion and the share dilution is representative of the yield we are able to generate for our shareholders as a Bitcoin development company. Hypothetically, assuming all outstanding convertible notes are fully converted at their respective conversion prices, all outstanding options are fully exercised and all restricted stock units and performance stock units fully vest, the fully diluted share count would have increased by only 4.8% during the first quarter. Thus, the increase in our Bitcoin holdings has outpaced the increase in our total share counts in Q1. Turning to slide 15, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed most other asset classes year-to-date. And as of March 31, 2024 the aggregate costs of our Bitcoin purchases were $7.5 billion versus the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings of $5.1 billion. This is compared to the market value of our holdings of $15.2 billion based on the Bitcoin prices of the last day of the quarter. Currently, the market value of our Bitcoin holdings is significantly above our average cost basis, which is equal to an average purchase price of approximately $35,200. The new accounting rule that was approved by the FASB last December requires companies holding digital assets, including Bitcoin to adopt fair value accounting treatment by Q1 of 2025. We fully plan to adopt the change by when the rule takes effect, and we are determining when the most appropriate time to do so would be. Now turning to our capital markets activities. Since the inception of our Bitcoin strategy, we have issued $3.6 billion of corporate debt through senior secured notes and convertible notes with a very attractive blended interest rate of approximately 1.3%. With staggered maturities over several years through March 2031. Leverage remains a key component of our active capital allocation strategy, which when opportunistically deploys -- deployed, enables us to add more Bitcoin holdings at an attractive cost. Our two recent convertible note financings were both upsized and well received by the market. We issued $800 million of convertible notes due March 2030 at an annual interest rate of 0.625% and a conversion premium of 42.5% to the closing price of our Class A common stock on the pricing day, reflecting a conversion price of approximately $14.98 per share. The following week, given the strong rally in MSTR stock price, we were able to access the market again in a follow on offering and issued an additional $603.75 million of convertible notes due March 2031 at an annual interest rate of 0.875% a conversion premium of 40% to the volume weighted average price of our Class A common stock on the pricing day, and a conversion price of approximately $2,327 per share. The net proceeds from both convertible note issuances were used expeditiously to acquire additional Bitcoin. In addition to raising debt, we continue to demonstrate a solid track record of issuing permanent equity in a manner that we believe is accretive to shareholders. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have raised a total of $3.2 billion in proceeds through our ATM offerings, with an average price of approximately $464 per share across total equity raised. As we have done in the past, we will continue to actively monitor the capital markets and carefully evaluate the most accretive use of the capital markets to drive incremental value for our shareholders. Debt financing helps us maintain healthy leverage relative to the market value of our Bitcoin Holdings, and raising equity helps us to deleverage our balance sheet when needed. The primary use of proceeds from our debt and equity capital activities to-date have been to acquire additional Bitcoin, which we have done in a manner we believe to be extremely accretive. Our overall capital allocation strategy continues to be focused on increasing our total Bitcoin Holdings, while managing our debt very closely and prudently. Lastly, as of the end of first quarter, we grew unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet to $81.3 million and we continue to maintain more than sufficient overall liquidity to manage our ongoing operating needs. The next slide illustrates our debt maturity profile. And as you can see the nearest maturity is more than six quarters away, and not until late 2025. While the 2025 convertible notes have been trading well in the market, as we have said previously, we continue to monitor the markets and evaluate liability management opportunities in order to manage our debt, as well as opportunities to raise additional financing in the future. The management team has demonstrated a strong track record of disciplined approach to navigate through volatile times in the Bitcoin market, and we believe we have established significant credibility to execute on our strategic goal of generating value for our shareholders. As Phong said earlier, we believe that the combination of our operating structure, Bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique value proposition for shareholder value creation, when compared to other forms of exposure to Bitcoin. Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks.\nMichael Saylor: Thank you, Andrew. And thank you for everybody for being with us here today. I'd just like to add a few comments on our strategy and Bitcoin in general following up on the words of Phong and Andrew. I'll start with, our performance scorecard, we like to keep score every quarter and evaluate ourself against all the relevant benchmarks. So I think this slide is very instructive. What you can see here in a nutshell is all of the enterprise software companies that we compete against in the business intelligence business and their performance since we embarked on our Bitcoin strategy in the summer of 2020. And you can see we're approximately 10 times to 30 times more in performance than any of those companies. You can see all the big tech stocks over the last three and three quarters of years. The strongest one is Google. And, you know, we've outperformed them anywhere by a factor of eight to 80, and we're very pleased with that. But, of course, our primary strategy is a Bitcoin strategy. And so I think to understand why is MicroStrategy able to return 937% in a period when the S&P returned 52%. And, I think, we just have to start with the idea of what's the right treasury strategy or how do you capitalize the company? And you can see if you capitalize the company on bonds, bonds have a negative 21% return over this time frame. Bonds have a negative real yield. They're not returning the cost of capital. The best surrogate for the cost of capital, I think, is the S&P Index, the 52%. And so if you were able to capitalize your company on the S&P Index, you could maybe keep up with the cost of capital. What you can see here is that, gold and silver don't really work. As the money supply expands, the S&P Index tracks it and gold, silver and bonds underperform. NASDAQ is pretty close statistically. Why is Bitcoin better? Because MicroStrategy's performance is really based on Bitcoin performance to start. And I think Bitcoin illustrates a couple of principles. One is, digital is better than analog. Bitcoin is digital property, and it's digital. So Bitcoin is performing, because it's digital in a world of digital transformation. I think the second thing it illustrates is a commodity is better than a security. And Bitcoin is an asset without an issuer, which makes it a global asset, and a security will never be a global asset because security has an issuer, an issuer is a company, and a company has a nexus and a country and has an operation. So Bitcoin's perform well because it's digital, because it's commodity. And, the third thing this illustrates is that a scarcity is better than a commodity. So the fact is, you know, Bitcoin is commodity, but it's hard capped at $21 million and gold is not hard capped and silver is not hard capped. So commodities generally make very, very poor investments. The world has learned to invest in market baskets of securities like the S&P Index, but it would be the wrong lesson to say that therefore securities are better than commodities. Securities have their own risk factors. The right lesson to take away is that something digital is better than something analog. Something, scarce is better than something abundant, and something global is better than something local. And Bitcoin represents all of those things. And the last four years, it has emerged in the Western world as that global digital scarce commodity, i.e., digital property. Now MicroStrategy, if it had just simply adopted Bitcoin purely, perhaps it would have had the same performance as Bitcoin. But how do we actually outperform Bitcoin? I think the key here is volatility is a benefit to us. And so we have harnessed volatility, and we've also harnessed our unique ability to issue securities such as convertible bonds. And the fact that we embrace the securitization of Bitcoin and we embrace the volatility of the asset class has given us the ability to raise capital, right? As you as you recall, we've raised billions of dollars of equity capital and billions of dollars of debt capital. We wouldn't have been able to raise as much capital without volatility, from and you could see with our convertible bonds, we managed to raise $3 billion in convertible bonds at substantially less than 1% interest. I mean, really about 50 basis points, 0.5% interest. So MicroStrategy's performance is being driven by two things. First, we're raising $3 billion at 0.5%, instead of paying a non-volatile interest rate. Non-volatile, you know, could be 8% to 10%. So instead of paying 8% to 10% interest, we're paying 0.5%. So clearly, that's a big performance boost to us. And the second is if we were non-volatile and we didn't have an asset rich strategy, we couldn't raise the $3 billion at all because, a lot of times senior debt would be capped at some EBITDA multiple of some sort. So we would be -- we would have access to a small amount of capital at a high cost of capital. So MicroStrategy has got a very low cost of capital and access to a lot of capital because of our particular strategy, but we're capitalizing on what clearly is the best capital asset, Bitcoin, in the world over this period. And the combination of those two things is what catapulted us to that 937% performance. Let me go to the next slide now. I would say this quarter, the first quarter of 2024, it's the end of the Crypto Childhood or the Crypto Cowboy era where you had had 15-years of lots of confusion, chaos, and jockeying of 1,000s and 1,000s of crypto assets. Well, Bitcoin is the winner and it is the one emergent institutional asset that has come out of that 15-years. Bitcoin, Spot ETFs were approved in January of this quarter, and that was a very big milestone. And as we go into this next quarter, it's pretty clear that Bitcoin is the only Crypto asset that's going to be approved for sale in the form of a Spot ETF in the United States. And so Bitcoin is very unique. It is the one Crypto asset that has been embraced as an institutional asset. It's the one Crypto asset that a publicly traded company can hold on its balance sheet, can capitalize upon. It's the one Crypto asset that Wall Street firms are going to be able to sell on a spot ETF basis. The entire modern institutional asset economy, the options market, the securities market, the money manager system, the institutional mutual funds, the institutional ETFs, they're all going to be centered around Bitcoin as the digital property going forward. And so while we're at the end of the beginning, you know, we're now, I would say, at the beginning of the middle. We're at the beginning of the stage of rapid institutional adoption of digital property in the form of Bitcoin. This chart shows that at the end of the first stage, Bitcoin is a bit more than a $1 trillion asset. And from this stage forward, it won't really compete against other Crypto assets. It will compete against gold, art, equities, real estate, bonds, you know, and other types of store of value money, in wealth creation, wealth preservation and the capital markets. And, as you can see, if you look at this chart, you know, probably some number between 10% and 50% of all this wealth is really just pure capital. The use case is store of value. Many people buy equities, real estate, bonds, and arts, and other monetary instruments as a store of value, just like they buy gold as a store of value. Bitcoin has digital property is a store of value, but it's the emergent high performance, high volatility, high functionality, high utility store of value, and it's global. So we actually think that it's going to continue to grow from here. And this is kind of the second quarter of about a 40 quarter, Bitcoin gold rush where we are going to see Bitcoin embraced by more and more banks, more and more money managers, more and more nations. You'll see more Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong and Australia. You'll see more derivative products and other types of related products built on top of it, or you'll see it built into more things. And so the next decade we think is auspicious. We can go to the next slide. The halving just took place in a week ago, a couple of weeks ago and April 19, I guess, specifically. And when you consider the impact of the halving, it's pretty profound. First of all, it reminds us that Bitcoin is a scarcity and not a digital commodity-only, because Bitcoin supply is asymptotically approaching $21 million. As of now, Bitcoin has the highest stock flow ratio in the world, so it is the hardest investment asset in the world and the most scarce or certain. In the first quarter, about 2,600 Bitcoin a day were acquired by the Spot ETFs that were launched. And during that time frame, we had about 900, bitcoin per day sold by miners. But then following the halving on the 19 April, we moved to 450 Bitcoin a day from available from natural sellers, the miners. This is pretty critical. And you can see there is an imbalance between organic demand and organic supply, I don't think, that the halving is priced in. I don't think that the market fully appreciates just how profound this is. But this the chart on the right gives you a way to think of it, which is if a large investor, a sovereign wealth fund or a mega institutional investor decided that they wanted to buy 450 Bitcoin per day, and they were going to buy it at the market price of Bitcoin every day for the next four years. Assuming the price of Bitcoin stayed constant at 60,000, they would have to invest $39.4 billion of capital. But if Bitcoin's price moved up at a 100,000, it's a $65 billion commitment at a 150,000, it's a $98 billion commitment. And if the average price of Bitcoin in that time frame is 250,000, that's the same as a $164 billion of capital being put into this network. So the network was chopping along at 900 BTC a day, before the halving. But after the halving, you just have a very reflexive protocol change that is going to remove 450 Bitcoin a day for sale at any price for the next four years. And, of course, there'll be another halving four years from now. They'll remove another 225 Bitcoin a day from the supply, and there will be another halving four years after that to move another 112 Bitcoin per day out of the supply. This is unique to Bitcoin. You won't see it in any other commodity in the world. You're not going to see it in any analog commodity because it's impossible. But you won't see it in any other digital commodity in the world because Bitcoin is the winner. Bitcoin is going to be, in all likelihood, the only digital commodity that is made institutional grade by a Spot ETF in the American Capital Markets. So this is a profound insight, and we view this as being very bullish for the asset class. We can go to the next slide. MicroStrategy's approach is the same as it has been. But I think we're getting a little bit better at it, and I think we're starting to understand our unique advantages, as time goes on. We are a Bitcoin development company in the same way that you might have a real estate development company. If you are able to create or create a company and then take it public and then issue securities in that capital markets in order to buy and develop commercial real estate, you would have an advantage over private companies, doing the same thing, because public companies always have an advantage in financing. You would have the option to raise financing, not just from banks, but also from the public capital markets. So we are a public company and an operating company, and that gives us a flexible, you know, control or active control over our capital structure. And the second thing that we have is the ability to innovate with, with software development. And we'll be showing some innovations at our conference this week that we're very excited about. We're also unique because we can generate cash from operations. And, as Phong and Andrew pointed out, we've been able to invest $825,000 in cash, to-date in order to acquire Bitcoin. And we're able to leverage the capital markets. And I think we take a very balanced view toward capital markets. When we think it's appropriate for us to issue equity or raise permanent equity capital via shelf registration, we do that. And we've done that, to raise $3.2 billion in equity capital. And when we think the markets are more supportive of us, issuing debt or especially convertible debt, then we do that. As Andrew pointed out, this strategy was very accretive in Q1 and the effective difference between, the accretion of Bitcoin and the dilution of our share count was more than 8%. So if we're able to generate an 8% yield in a single quarter, then we believe that's going to support a premium to our underlying net asset value going forward. And it's going to allow us to find more accretive capital markets opportunities in the future that we will avail ourselves of to the benefit of our shareholders. And so in summary, Bitcoin's crossed the chasm to institutional adoption. Bitcoin is unique and is being uniquely recognized as the one institutional Crypto asset. And MicroStrategy has now developed a very balanced strategy of acquiring Bitcoin with cash flows with equity, with debt. And we're providing a useful set of public securities, both equity as well as options, as well as debt instruments that institutional investors can use in order to tailor their portfolio as they invest, whether it's long or short or hedged in the macro economy and the Crypto economy doing it on exchanges and in a way that's compliant with all of their operating charters. And that, in a nutshell, I think, explains the MicroStrategy value proposition and our opportunity going forward. And with that, I'll go ahead and pass the floor back to Shirish.\nOperator:\nA - Shirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. Now we will begin our Q&A's and the first question is for Phong. Can you elaborate on the company's new positioning as the Bitcoin development company? And are there any new developments that you would like to highlight?\nPhong Le: Yes. Thanks, Shirish. I guess we talked quite extensively during our prepared remarks about the Bitcoin development company. I think perhaps the question is more specific about the development portion and whether we're doing any software development in the Bitcoin area. For those who are attending Bitcoin for corporations on Wednesday, we'll have about a half day talking about the technology ecosystem associated with Bitcoin. And we\u2019ll also share some new developments in an area of Bitcoin security that we're working on. And I think people will be excited to see some of the things we're doing in that space. We continue to experiment and continue to advocate for Bitcoin development, and so there's more work going on in that area that we'll share, in a couple of days.\nShirish Jajodia: Great. Thanks, Phong. Next question is for Michael. MicroStrategy's equity premium towards Bitcoin Holdings has expanded materially over the past few months. And, despite the recent Bitcoin pullback, the premium remains healthy? How do you think about the premium and what do you attribute this to?\nMichael Saylor: I think that if we had no leverage and we generated no accretion, then we would start to look like a Spot Bitcoin ETF. But the fact -- if we have leverage, then the leverage will justify a premium. If the leverage was if we just had a $1 billion of leverage and we were paying 10% interest, it would be a small premium. We would be basically levering a $1 billion at 10% interest that's yielding where Bitcoin is appreciating at 40% or more. So there would be definitely a premium, but it would be the difference between the leverage and the yield of Bitcoin or the depreciated Bitcoin on a small amount of money on a $1 billion. But if we have more leverage and if the cost of the capital is lower, then that justifies a higher premium. So when you get to $3 billion of converts and when the converts are 50 basis points, then you've got more leverage and you've got a lower cost to capital. So I think that justifies a higher premium. When you're able to issue billions of dollars of equity at that premium, then that justifies in turn an even higher premium. And it also strengthens the capital structure, providing us with unpledged assets that, that we can use for future financings are used to leverage future corporate opportunities. And then, of course, when we're able to do, convertible issuances and then convert it into Bitcoin and capture, not just the premium upfront, but the benefits over the next six years of Bitcoin appreciation, that justifies another premium. So you could imagine if you could, if you thought you could generate an 8% accretion per year, there's no reason why you couldn't justify a 100% or more premium in that asset value. If you could generate, an 8% accretion more often than once a year, if you could do it from quarter-to-quarter or every other quarter or do anything, consistently over time, then, it's quite possible to come to any number of different premium calculations. Ultimately, you know, the company's premium is a function of our ability to execute over a long period of time and also, you know, the market's view as to whether or not they appreciate that. And of course, that's a shifting sentiment, and there's uncertainty into the future. So there will continue to be uncertainty about what the right premium ought to be, and I think that's what makes the market.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Michael. The next question is regarding Michael's 10B51 plan. Has the plan, to exercise MicroStrategy stock options completed already? And can you please provide further color on the executed plan and the thought process behind the stock sales?\nPhong Le: Yes, Shirish, let me take that one. So I guess, first off, Michael's option exercises were planned and actually fully disclosed. I believe it was in our Q3 filing of last year. And as most know, as officers and directors of the company, we have to put in place a 10B51 plan, which discloses that upfront. The plan was, related to, 400,000 options, which, Michael received back in 2014, which were set to expire, this April. So, you know, the sales were programmatic. Michael sold 5,000 shares, on each trading day between Jan 2 and April 25 at market prices. And, again, the sales were executed under the plan. It was completed on the 25, as disclosed, and he does not have any additional 10B51 plan in place at the time. So it's worth noting also, that, obviously, Michael still holds a significant ownership stake in the company. And I know there's been a lot of some questions and chatter around on the sales, but it's really as simple as, they were put in place, disclosed and programmatic, to do so before, his options expired.\nShirish Jajodia: Thanks, Andrew. We're coming to the end of the time. We'll take one last question here. This one is for Phong. Can you please elaborate on the progress of converting software clients to Cloud from license and the AI related partnerships?\nPhong Le: Yeah. So, you know, they're one and the same. A lot of our AI and cloud partnerships are with the large hyperscalers, especially Microsoft, AWS, and Google Cloud. We're being pretty aggressive working with our hyperscalers and our partners this year to get as many customers to cloud as possible. We have some pretty ambitious plans. You'll note, and Andrew noted, that, that does have a short-term impact of product license revenue because the product license revenue represents the incremental revenue of on-prem customers, and we're trying to -- as we move customers to cloud. You'll see that offset, overtime. So moving fast using our partners, AI is only available in the cloud, so it's another impetus for customers to move to cloud, but it'll have some short-term disruption in our product license revenue and our total revenue. Many companies have gone through this transition. We're well equipped to do the same, and I'm excited about the prospects of what that means for us, in the long-term.\nShirish Jajodia: Thank you, Phong. And thank you everyone for your questions. We received a lot of great questions and we tried to address in the prepared remarks and the Q&A afterwards. So this concludes the Q&A portion of the webinar today. I will now turn the call over to Phong for the final closing remarks.\nPhong Le: Thanks, everyone. I really want to thank everyone for being with us today. We appreciate your support. We're also excited to host MicroStrategy World in Las Vegas over the next three days and looking forward to seeing customers, prospects, partners, analysts, and shareholders alike at this one of a kind event. For those who aren't able to be here in person, we're also live streaming our keynotes from MicroStrategy World, which starts at 9:30 a.m., Pacific time tomorrow, and the entirety of Bitcoin for corporations. So you'll be able to watch, both of those online. If you're not able to be here in person, you're invited to join. Get details at our website www.microstrategy.com. We're as enthusiastic as ever. With both our enterprise software strategy as well as our Bitcoin strategy, and we wish you a good quarter and look forward to seeing you all again in 12 weeks. Thank you all.",

But you won't see it in any other digital commodity in the world because Bitcoin is the winner. Bitcoin is going to be, in all likelihood, the only digital commodity that is made institutional grade by a Spot ETF in the American Capital Markets. So this is a profound insight, and we view this as being very bullish for the asset class. We can go to the next slide. MicroStrategy's approach is the same as it has been. But I think we're getting a little bit better at it, and I think we're starting to understand our unique advantages, as time goes on. We are a Bitcoin development company in the same way that you might have a real estate development company. If you are able to create or create a company and then take it public and then issue securities in that capital markets in order to buy and develop commercial real estate, you would have an advantage over private companies, doing the same thing, because public companies always have an advantage in financing. You would have the option to raise financing, not just from banks, but also from the public capital markets. So we are a public company and an operating company, and that gives us a flexible, you know, control or active control over our capital structure. And the second thing that we have is the ability to innovate with, with software development. And we'll be showing some innovations at our conference this week that we're very excited about. We're also unique because we can generate cash from operations. And, as Phong and Andrew pointed out, we've been able to invest $825,000 in cash, to-date in order to acquire Bitcoin. And we're able to leverage the capital markets. And I think we take a very balanced view toward capital markets. When we think it's appropriate for us to issue equity or raise permanent equity capital via shelf registration, we do that. And we've done that, to raise $3.2 billion in equity capital. And when we think the markets are more supportive of us, issuing debt or especially convertible debt, then we do that. As Andrew pointed out, this strategy was very accretive in Q1 and the effective difference between, the accretion of Bitcoin and the dilution of our share count was more than 8%. So if we're able to generate an 8% yield in a single quarter, then we believe that's going to support a premium to our underlying net asset value going forward. And it's going to allow us to find more accretive capital markets opportunities in the future that we will avail ourselves of to the benefit of our shareholders. And so in summary, Bitcoin's crossed the chasm to institutional adoption. Bitcoin is unique and is being uniquely recognized as the one institutional Crypto asset. And MicroStrategy has now developed a very balanced strategy of acquiring Bitcoin with cash flows with equity, with debt. And we're providing a useful set of public securities, both equity as well as options, as well as debt instruments that institutional investors can use in order to tailor their portfolio as they invest, whether it's long or short or hedged in the macro economy and the Crypto economy doing it on exchanges and in a way that's compliant with all of their operating charters. And that, in a nutshell, I think, explains the MicroStrategy value proposition and our opportunity going forward. And with that, I'll go ahead and pass the floor back to Shirish. I think that if we had no leverage and we generated no accretion, then we would start to look like a Spot Bitcoin ETF. But the fact -- if we have leverage, then the leverage will justify a premium. If the leverage was if we just had a $1 billion of leverage and we were paying 10% interest, it would be a small premium. We would be basically levering a $1 billion at 10% interest that's yielding where Bitcoin is appreciating at 40% or more. So there would be definitely a premium, but it would be the difference between the leverage and the yield of Bitcoin or the depreciated Bitcoin on a small amount of money on a $1 billion. But if we have more leverage and if the cost of the capital is lower, then that justifies a higher premium. So when you get to $3 billion of converts and when the converts are 50 basis points, then you've got more leverage and you've got a lower cost to capital. So I think that justifies a higher premium. When you're able to issue billions of dollars of equity at that premium, then that justifies in turn an even higher premium. And it also strengthens the capital structure, providing us with unpledged assets that, that we can use for future financings are used to leverage future corporate opportunities. And then, of course, when we're able to do, convertible issuances and then convert it into Bitcoin and capture, not just the premium upfront, but the benefits over the next six years of Bitcoin appreciation, that justifies another premium. So you could imagine if you could, if you thought you could generate an 8% accretion per year, there's no reason why you couldn't justify a 100% or more premium in that asset value. If you could generate, an 8% accretion more often than once a year, if you could do it from quarter-to-quarter or every other quarter or do anything, consistently over time, then, it's quite possible to come to any number of different premium calculations. Ultimately, you know, the company's premium is a function of our ability to execute over a long period of time and also, you know, the market's view as to whether or not they appreciate that. And of course, that's a shifting sentiment, and there's uncertainty into the future. So there will continue to be uncertainty about what the right premium ought to be, and I think that's what makes the market."

            "name": "Andrew Kang",
            "content": "Thank you, Phong. I'll, start with first, a recap of our software financial results. For the Q1, total revenues were a $115.2 million, which was down about 5% year-over-year. Consistent with prior recent quarters, the slight decline remains in part due to our ongoing shift, of revenue from on-prem to cloud. Q1 on-prem product license revenues, which make up about 11% of total revenue, were about $12.900 million, which is down 26% year-over-year. As I mentioned in prior calls, we continue to transition our business to the cloud, and we fully anticipate lower product license revenues to continue as we migrate existing customers off on-prem licenses and bring them on to the cloud. More importantly, as Phong mentioned earlier, we continue to grow subscription services revenues, which reflects stronger, more durable recurring software revenue. In Q1, subscription services revenues, which now make up about 20% of total revenues, were $23 million, which reflects an increase of 22% year-over-year. Non-GAAP subscription billings, which represent new cloud bookings in the quarter, also grew by 30% in the Q1 to $17.7 million, which was our fourth straight year of quarterly double-digit growth in cloud bookings. Q4 last year was an important milestone for us in the progress toward cloud transition, where for the first time, our subscription services revenues were higher than our product license revenues. This successful trend continued in the first quarter of 2024, which reflects the ongoing progress towards converting our revenue to recurring subscription services. The mix of revenue will continue to shift from on-premise product license to subscription services throughout 2024, as we focus on delivering meaningful AI-based products to our customers, which is only available in the cloud. We are pleased with the progress we have made from the adoption from our customers to our cloud platform worldwide, and we still have more to do, and we'll continue to focus on new products and innovation to drive more demand in that space. Beginning with the first quarter of 2024, we modified our reported financials to break out our quarterly results into two categories: First, the software business category reflects income or loss from operations related distinctly to our enterprise BI software business. And the corporate and other category reflects the other non-software related components associated with our digital asset holdings, which include impairment charges and other related third-party costs. While we continue to operate under one reportable operating segment, which is engaged in design, development, and sales of our software platform through licensing arrangements, cloud subscriptions, and related services, we believe this breakout of our operating results into these two categories provides better transparency with respect to the performance of our software business, while isolating the impacts related to changes in Bitcoin prices. In Q1, the software business revenues were $115 million as mentioned a moment ago, while the cost of revenues were $30 million up 7.4%, compared to Q1 of last year. The increase in costs were in part due to higher cloud hosting, a result of higher usage by new and existing cloud subscription services customers. It was also attributed to costs associated with standing up an enhanced customer success function with an added focus on transitioning customers to our cloud platform, in addition to servicing and managing our strong existing customer base. Software business operating expenses were $96.1 million, up 1.7%, compared to $94.5 million in Q1 of last year. The increase was primarily due to higher G&A expenses this quarter, which was specifically related to an increase in employer payroll taxes in connect with employee stock option exercises in the Q1. However, overall operating expenses were also offset by lower costs in sales, marketing, and R&D, also consistent with recent quarters as we maintain strong discipline in expenses and we continue to optimize overall headcount. Non-cash, stock based compensation expense was mostly flat year-over-year at $17.8 million for the quarter. And overall non-GAAP adjusted operating income or profit from the software business category was $6.9 million. If you take into account the employer paid payroll taxes related to stock option exercises in Q1, which were not material in prior periods, non-GAAP adjusted operating income from the core software business would have reflected $14.3 million for the first quarter, more appropriately reflecting the quarter's profitability from our software business. Lastly, the corporate and other operating expense category for the quarter is almost entirely attributable to Bitcoin impairment charges, which were $192 million, compared to $20 million in Q1 of last year, the result of Bitcoin price fluctuations throughout this past quarter. Turning to our Bitcoin strategy more specifically, we had one of the most successful quarters of adding more Bitcoin to our balance sheet, as we acquired 25,128 Bitcoins in the first quarter, our second largest single quarter increase in Bitcoin Holdings since Q4 2020. Additionally, after the end of first quarter, we purchased an additional 122 Bitcoins using $8 million of excess cash. And as of April 26, 2024, the company held a total of 214,400 Bitcoins acquired from an aggregate cost of $7.54 billion or $35,180 per Bitcoin. To break down the Bitcoin acquisition activity year-to-date by entity, Bitcoin acquired the proceeds from equity capital markets activities that occurred after the issuance of our senior secured notes are held at MacroStrategy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MicroStrategy. Year-to-date, we have added 2,652 Bitcoins to MacroStrategy's Holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $137 million using net proceeds from our at the market or ATM equity issuance programs in February. Currently, we hold 175,721 unencumbered Bitcoins, representing 82% of our total holdings or $11.2 billion incurred market value, which are held at MacroStrategy. These are all unrestricted and provide the option to potentially leverage this strategic asset in the future. Bitcoin's acquired through proceeds from debt activities that occurred after the issuance of our senior secured notes, namely the two recent convertible note issuances in Q1 are held at MicroStrategy, the parent, and also serve as collateral securing our 2028 senior secured notes. Year-to-date, we have added 20,180 Bitcoins to MicroStrategy's holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion using net proceeds from our two convertible note issuances in March. Lastly, Bitcoins purchased through excess cash from the software business are also held at MicroStrategy, the parent entity, and also collateralize our 2028 senior secured notes. Year-to-date we have added 2,418 Bitcoins to MicroStrategy's Holdings at an aggregate purchase price of $136 million using proceeds from excess cash. As of April 26, there are in total 38,679 Bitcoins held at MicroStrategy or $2.4 billion in current market value. Our commitment to our Bitcoin strategy remains unchanged and steadfast, and we plan to strategically and opportunistically buy more Bitcoin as we have in every quarter since August of 2020 using excess cash from operations and proceeds from any capital markets activities. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, and we remain committed to our Bitcoin acquisition strategy with the utmost conviction, long-term focus, and with a strong risk managed approach. As a Bitcoin development company, the unique ability to access the capital markets and the positive impact from using intelligent leverage are illustrated on this slide. During the first quarter of 2024, our total Bitcoin Holdings increased by 13.3%. During the same period, our total basic share count comprised of total basic Class A shares outstanding and total basic Class B shares outstanding increased by only 4.6%. This is in part due to the deferred dilution impact of leveraging convertible debt and our opportunistic execution of these financings, which has resulted in tremendous value creation for our shareholders. The difference between our Bitcoin accretion and the share dilution is representative of the yield we are able to generate for our shareholders as a Bitcoin development company. Hypothetically, assuming all outstanding convertible notes are fully converted at their respective conversion prices, all outstanding options are fully exercised and all restricted stock units and performance stock units fully vest, the fully diluted share count would have increased by only 4.8% during the first quarter. Thus, the increase in our Bitcoin holdings has outpaced the increase in our total share counts in Q1. Turning to slide 15, Bitcoin has significantly outperformed most other asset classes year-to-date. And as of March 31, 2024 the aggregate costs of our Bitcoin purchases were $7.5 billion versus the carrying value of our Bitcoin holdings of $5.1 billion. This is compared to the market value of our holdings of $15.2 billion based on the Bitcoin prices of the last day of the quarter. Currently, the market value of our Bitcoin holdings is significantly above our average cost basis, which is equal to an average purchase price of approximately $35,200. The new accounting rule that was approved by the FASB last December requires companies holding digital assets, including Bitcoin to adopt fair value accounting treatment by Q1 of 2025. We fully plan to adopt the change by when the rule takes effect, and we are determining when the most appropriate time to do so would be. Now turning to our capital markets activities. Since the inception of our Bitcoin strategy, we have issued $3.6 billion of corporate debt through senior secured notes and convertible notes with a very attractive blended interest rate of approximately 1.3%. With staggered maturities over several years through March 2031. Leverage remains a key component of our active capital allocation strategy, which when opportunistically deploys -- deployed, enables us to add more Bitcoin holdings at an attractive cost. Our two recent convertible note financings were both upsized and well received by the market. We issued $800 million of convertible notes due March 2030 at an annual interest rate of 0.625% and a conversion premium of 42.5% to the closing price of our Class A common stock on the pricing day, reflecting a conversion price of approximately $14.98 per share. The following week, given the strong rally in MSTR stock price, we were able to access the market again in a follow on offering and issued an additional $603.75 million of convertible notes due March 2031 at an annual interest rate of 0.875% a conversion premium of 40% to the volume weighted average price of our Class A common stock on the pricing day, and a conversion price of approximately $2,327 per share. The net proceeds from both convertible note issuances were used expeditiously to acquire additional Bitcoin. In addition to raising debt, we continue to demonstrate a solid track record of issuing permanent equity in a manner that we believe is accretive to shareholders. Since the third quarter of 2021, we have raised a total of $3.2 billion in proceeds through our ATM offerings, with an average price of approximately $464 per share across total equity raised. As we have done in the past, we will continue to actively monitor the capital markets and carefully evaluate the most accretive use of the capital markets to drive incremental value for our shareholders. Debt financing helps us maintain healthy leverage relative to the market value of our Bitcoin Holdings, and raising equity helps us to deleverage our balance sheet when needed. The primary use of proceeds from our debt and equity capital activities to-date have been to acquire additional Bitcoin, which we have done in a manner we believe to be extremely accretive. Our overall capital allocation strategy continues to be focused on increasing our total Bitcoin Holdings, while managing our debt very closely and prudently. Lastly, as of the end of first quarter, we grew unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet to $81.3 million and we continue to maintain more than sufficient overall liquidity to manage our ongoing operating needs. The next slide illustrates our debt maturity profile. And as you can see the nearest maturity is more than six quarters away, and not until late 2025. While the 2025 convertible notes have been trading well in the market, as we have said previously, we continue to monitor the markets and evaluate liability management opportunities in order to manage our debt, as well as opportunities to raise additional financing in the future. The management team has demonstrated a strong track record of disciplined approach to navigate through volatile times in the Bitcoin market, and we believe we have established significant credibility to execute on our strategic goal of generating value for our shareholders. As Phong said earlier, we believe that the combination of our operating structure, Bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique value proposition for shareholder value creation, when compared to other forms of exposure to Bitcoin. Thank you for your time today and for your continued support of MicroStrategy. I'll now turn the call over to Michael for his remarks."

            "name": "Phong Le",
            "content": "Thanks, Shirish. Hello, everyone. I'd like to welcome all of you to today's webinar. We're excited to be reporting live from MicroStrategy World 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. We have a packed agenda lined up for the next three days and we're excited to see our customers, partners, analysts, shareholders, and employees all in person to share our passion for BI, AI, Bitcoin, and Innovation. The business intelligence track tomorrow will feature my keynote presentation titled Let The Data Lifeblood Flow, and we'll explore how to create more innovative, competitive, high performing organizations by using AI and BI to make smart data more accessible to the frontline employees. Our Chief Product Officer, Saurabh Abhyankar will share the latest MicroStrategy technologies for delivering convenient, flexible and reliable data within operational workflows, not just in dashboards, to everyone who needs it. The keynote presentation will feature guest speakers from Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Bayer Pharmaceuticals, the U. S. Department of State, and Vuori. Throughout MicroStrategy World, more than 30 top brands, including MassMutual, Pfizer, Fannie Mae, Victoria's Secret, and NBCUniversal, will present how they use the MicroStrategy platform, Gen AI, and the cloud to become truly data-driven businesses. The Bitcoin for corporations track on Wednesday and Thursday will feature notable institutions and industry luminaries highlighting the advantages of integrating Bitcoin as a part of their corporate treasury and product offerings. It will be a unique gathering of corporations that are already adopting or looking to adopt Bitcoin strategies, and we are very excited to host this event. Also, for the first time, we will livestream our World Keynote, as well as all the Bitcoin for Corporation sessions. For those of you attending the conference here in Las Vegas, we look forward to seeing you in person. Turning to the business highlights for Q1 2024. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, now holding 214,400 Bitcoin with a total Bitcoin market value of $14 billion as of yesterday. Since December 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 25,250 Bitcoin for a total purchase cost of $1.6 billion at an average price of $65,232. This past quarter, the price of Bitcoin appreciated significantly, spurred notably by the approval of the spot Bitcoin exchange traded products or ETPs, which has drawn considerable institutional attention. We believe the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETPs further evidences the maturation of Bitcoin as an institutional grade asset class with broader regulatory recognition and institutional adoption. We remain highly committed to our Bitcoin strategy with a long-term focus. Andrew will provide further details on our Bitcoin purchase activity for this quarter. MicroStrategy is also positioned as the world's largest independent publicly traded business intelligence company. Our objective to grow in AI, our objective is to grow in AI and cloud powered BI software. We have over 1,800 employees focused on our software business, devoted to achieving our vision of intelligence everywhere. In the first quarter of 2024, we continued our shift towards our cloud offering, resulting in subscription services revenues of $23 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year. A strong growth in our subscription services revenue was driven by both existing customer migrations to the cloud and new customer wins. Our customer renewal rate continues to remain high and our subscription billings remain strong. Overall, we continue to see further global adoption of our cloud platform as a result of transitioning our business strategy and product offerings from an on-prem perpetual licensed software company to a cloud native profitability. Our key strategic goals in 2024 are to grow cloud, innovate with AI, and increase profitability. Customers can benefit from a range of innovative first to market AI powered functionality, powered by the Azure, OpenAI, LLM. Capabilities include Auto SQL, which allows users to generate SQL using natural language, auto dashboard, which allows natural language generation of new visualizations. Auto Answers, which allows customers to ask questions of their datasets and dashboards, Auto Expert which allows users to ask questions of our MicroStrategy knowledge base and log support tickets on our website and our custom Auto Bot, which enables end users to access BI insights from within a custom bot, stand alone or embedded in any application. We also just launched Auto Express, which offers a simple way to trial our AI capabilities in minutes. In April, MicroStrategy one became available on Google Cloud Marketplace in addition to prior deployments on Azure and AWS, allowing enterprises to easily find and deploy this cloud native platform. Additionally, we expect to provide the ability to deploy MicroStrategy in a private cloud later this year. This will distinguish us from other BI platforms with the flexibility and automation that enterprise customers desire. We believe such investment and capability will encourage current on-prem customers to embrace the benefits of MicroStrategy. Cloud, such as containerized architecture, proactive cloud management from experts, seamless backups and single click updates. Transitioning our customer base to the technology of the future remains a key focus, and our resource deployment underscores our commitment to the cloud first approach. As customers and prospects move to the cloud to empower their AI-driven digital transformations, we expect to see a continued decrease in product license revenues, which will in part be offset by increases in subscription services revenues. This will be most pronounced in the balance of 2024. This may result in a decrease in total recognized revenue in the short-term, but in the long run, we expect it to be more than offset by increases in subscription services revenue. Additional benefits include more engaged customer is using our very latest software, higher retention rates, and ultimately more recurring revenue. As we discussed last quarter, MicroStrategy considers itself to be the world's first Bitcoin development company. We are a publicly traded operating company committed to the continued development of the Bitcoin network throughout our activities in the financial markets, advocacy and technology innovation. As an operating business, we are able to use cash flows, as well as proceeds from equity and debt financing in this to accumulate Bitcoin, which serves as our primary treasury reserve asset. We also bring our enterprise analytics software development capabilities to develop Bitcoin applications. We believe that the combination of our operating structure, Bitcoin strategy, and focus on technology innovation provides a unique opportunity for value creation. Being an operating company, our software technology business remains our core revenue and cash flow generator. In addition, it also enables us to acquire Bitcoin through the use of excess cash or proceeds from equity capital raises or corporate debt capital raises. These capital market levers allow us to deploy intelligent leverage to increase our Bitcoin holdings in a manner, which we believe has created shareholder value. Since our adoption of our Bitcoin strategy, we've used three primary mechanisms to acquire more Bitcoin: cash flows from software operations. Since 2020, we've invested $825 million of total cash on our balance sheet. Equity issuances, we have issued $3.2 billion in equity in a manner that we believe to be accretive to existing shareholders. And debt financing, we've issued $3.6 billion in debt through the issuance of both senior secured notes and convertible notes. We've used the proceeds from these issuances principally to purchase Bitcoin. The blended cost of our outstanding debt is fixed at 1.3% annually. In the first quarter of 2024, we generated approximately $7.2 billion of incremental value from the effect of increases in the price of Bitcoin on our existing Bitcoin holdings, as well as our strategic use of equity and debt capital market activities. We began the year with 189,150 Bitcoin holdings with a market value of approximately $8 billion. As Bitcoin prices increased from $42,500 to $71,000 by the end of the first quarter, we experienced an increase of $5.4 billion in value based on our Bitcoin Holdings at the start of the year. In addition to the incremental value from their price appreciation of the Bitcoin we held as of the beginning of the year, we purchased an additional $1.6 billion of Bitcoin in the first quarter using proceeds from the issuance of additional equity and two convertible senior note offerings, as well as excess cash from operations. As a result, we added an additional 25,128 Bitcoin to our holdings at an average price of roughly $65,200, which generated an incremental approximately $145 million of value from an increase in the price of Bitcoin after those purchases were made through the end of Q1. Overall, 2024 started off as a tremendously successful year taking into account our Bitcoin purchases and appreciation of our Bitcoin holdings year-to-date. While the overall market benefited from the increase in Bitcoin price as well, we believe our opportunistic use of leverage and excess cash to acquire Bitcoin, as well as our capital market strategy generated $1.8 billion of incremental shareholder value, demonstrating our track record of generating value for our shareholders. This slide shows an illustrative example of how intelligent leverage can be used to boost returns when Bitcoin prices are increasing. The baseline returns of any long Bitcoin strategy from spot Bitcoin price appreciation. Bitcoin ETPs also benefit from this, offset by the management fees that are charged for those products. Leverage provides the opportunity to generate higher returns if the price increases. In this illustration, assuming Bitcoin price reaches $250,000 keeping Bitcoin count constant, spot Bitcoin without leverage would return approximately 290%. In this example, adding leverage to acquire more Bitcoin would return between approximately 395% to 425% depending on the amount of leverage, further boosting returns compared to simply holding the spot Bitcoin. If the market value of our bitcoin increases, we believe this would create more opportunities to manage our leverage targets. With the opportunity to take on more leverage in a prudent risk managed fashion, the value generated from our increasing Bitcoin holdings would be expected to outperform even further if Bitcoin prices continue to rise. We believe our unique value proposition as the world's first Bitcoin development company has enabled us to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Andrew to discuss our financials for the quarter in further detail. Yes. Thanks, Shirish. I guess we talked quite extensively during our prepared remarks about the Bitcoin development company. I think perhaps the question is more specific about the development portion and whether we're doing any software development in the Bitcoin area. For those who are attending Bitcoin for corporations on Wednesday, we'll have about a half day talking about the technology ecosystem associated with Bitcoin. And we'll also share some new developments in an area of Bitcoin security that we're working on. And I think people will be excited to see some of the things we're doing in that space. We continue to experiment and continue to advocate for Bitcoin development, and so there's more work going on in that area that we'll share, in a couple of days. Yes, Shirish, let me take that one. So I guess, first off, Michael's option exercises were planned and actually fully disclosed. I believe it was in our Q3 filing of last year. And as most know, as officers and directors of the company, we have to put in place a 10B51 plan, which discloses that upfront. The plan was, related to, 400,000 options, which, Michael received back in 2014, which were set to expire, this April. So, you know, the sales were programmatic. Michael sold 5,000 shares, on each trading day between Jan 2 and April 25 at market prices. And, again, the sales were executed under the plan. It was completed on the 25, as disclosed, and he does not have any additional 10B51 plan in place at the time. So it's worth noting also, that, obviously, Michael still holds a significant ownership stake in the company. And I know there's been a lot of some questions and chatter around on the sales, but it's really as simple as, they were put in place, disclosed and programmatic, to do so before, his options expired. Yeah. So, you know, they're one and the same. A lot of our AI and cloud partnerships are with the large hyperscalers, especially Microsoft, AWS, and Google Cloud. We're being pretty aggressive working with our hyperscalers and our partners this year to get as many customers to cloud as possible. We have some pretty ambitious plans. You'll note, and Andrew noted, that, that does have a short-term impact of product license revenue because the product license revenue represents the incremental revenue of on-prem customers, and we're trying to -- as we move customers to cloud. You'll see that offset, overtime. So moving fast using our partners, AI is only available in the cloud, so it's another impetus for customers to move to cloud, but it'll have some short-term disruption in our product license revenue and our total revenue. Many companies have gone through this transition. We're well equipped to do the same, and I'm excited about the prospects of what that means for us, in the long-term. Thanks, everyone. I really want to thank everyone for being with us today. We appreciate your support. We're also excited to host MicroStrategy World in Las Vegas over the next three days and looking forward to seeing customers, prospects, partners, analysts, and shareholders alike at this one of a kind event. For those who aren't able to be here in person, we're also live streaming our keynotes from MicroStrategy World, which starts at 9:30 a.m., Pacific time tomorrow, and the entirety of Bitcoin for corporations. So you'll be able to watch, both of those online. If you're not able to be here in person, you're invited to join. Get details at our website www.microstrategy.com. We're as enthusiastic as ever. With both our enterprise software strategy as well as our Bitcoin strategy, and we wish you a good quarter and look forward to seeing you all again in 12 weeks. Thank you all."
