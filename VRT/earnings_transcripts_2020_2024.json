At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. \n Now I'd like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Nick. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, David Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem. \n Before we begin, I point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement or proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. \n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investor.vertiv.com. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, David Cote. \nDavid Cote: Thanks, Lynne. As I reflect on the past year in Vertiv, I'm even more encouraged that everything we discussed in the road show has been proved to be even more true today. Vertiv has a great position in a good industry and we can differentiate with technology. Sales growth and margin rate expansion opportunity abounds, and we have a team that's making it happen. That opportunity shone brightly in 2020. We were able to hold sales flat and significantly increase orders in a terribly difficult year. We were able to increase our margin rate on flat sales, which is always difficult. And at the same time, we ramped up investment in R&D, other growth drivers, and process initiatives like the Vertiv Operating System, Vertiv Product Development, functional transformation and customer view, the Vertiv User Experience. \n The same is true for 2021. As Vertiv guides to sales growth, margin rate expansion and the reinvestment that drives both in 2022 and beyond. Cash and overall liquidity improved markedly and net leverage is down a lot more than anticipated, especially in a COVID year. My confidence has increased, not decreased over the past year. No matter where I look in Vertiv, we're making great progress. As Timbuk 3 said in their 1986 song, \"The future is so bright, we got to wear shades.\" I felt that way a year ago, and I feel that way even more so today. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thank you, Dave, and I truly appreciate your partnership and the good advice you continue to provide to me and my executive leadership team. I also want to thank the Vertiv employees for their efforts in Q4 and throughout last year. They pulled together and demonstrated how our collective efforts can accomplish amazing feats during a very challenging time. They've adopted to a can-do attitude, used creativity, ingenuity and outside-the-box thinking in order to serve our customers during this pandemic. I commend my team, my Board and our many partners for delivering the results I will share with you today. \n Moving to Slide 3. Overall, the demand side of our business was very promising as Q4 sales were up over 11% compared to Q4 of 2019, driven largely by significant growth in the European and Asia Pacific regions. Orders for the quarter were up 9% when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And I'm pleased to remind you that the orders for Q3 were already up 15% as compared to Q3 of the previous year. \n Our backlog remains at an all-time high and is up $450 million from the end of 2019. We will talk more specifically about the demand side of the business over the next few slides. \n From a profitability standpoint, our adjusted EBITDA was $187 million, which was up over 25% from last year's Q4. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 160 basis points, driven higher by sales, higher contribution margin and lower fixed costs on a percentage basis. Additionally, our free cash flow at the end of Q4 improved over the same time period last year by $86 million to $175 million because of higher earnings and lower transformation spending. \n Turning to the full year results of 2020. We delivered $39 million more in adjusted EBITDA as compared to 2019, with sales down approximately 1%. This equates to 110 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin versus the prior year. Our free cash flow improved $171 million over last year to $163 million, driven primarily by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower cash interest. \n Looking at 2021, we anticipate above-market top line growth, increase in profitability, an even stronger balance sheet, all while continuing to invest significantly in strategic areas like research and development and sales and marketing. \n Finally, I wanted to let you know that we have transitioned to the measure of profitability from adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating profit. While there are a few moving parts associated with this transition, this is nothing more than continuing on our committed path to keeping our financials and communications as simple as possible. In order to aid the analysts with this transition, we've included Exhibit 99.2 in our 8-K that reconciles all the pertinent information. David will speak to this further during his section as well. \n Turning to Slide 4. We've used this slide over the past few quarters to illustrate what we are seeing in our market environment regarding demand. It's been updated here to reflect how things look today. \n In the cloud and colocation market, we continue to see strong levels of activity in every region, as indicated by the 6 green buttons in the top 2 rows. Emerging digital applications, such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, and that demand benefits us as well. \n In contrast, we see the enterprise and small to medium business continuing to be challenged by COVID, as indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row 3. Its spending continues to be mixed. We commented last quarter that this segment was slightly more positive in October than it was in July, and it's slightly better today than it was in October. The change is subtle, but it is trending in the right direction. \n Switching to the telecom side of things. We see little change from last quarter. However, we are seeing an uptick of 5G deployment in U.S. and parts of Asia. Several of our larger U.S. carriers are continuing to roll out 5G and we expect the rollout to continue for several more quarters. \n Finally, our commercial and industrial business often tracks GDP, but sometimes the quarterly timing can be different. There was a positive movement in a few light commercial and industrial applications over the past few months. The most notable changes we are seeing are taking place in Europe. So certainly some puts and takes, but overall, a strong market picture given our mix of the data center business. The digital applications people use every day continue to become more and more important to daily living as the result of demand increasing for those digital applications so they can be processed, stored and transmitted. This is creating a significant opportunity for our customers and,  consequently, a significant opportunity for Vertiv. \n Moving to Slide 5. To reiterate, the overall demand is strong as evidenced by our order rates and backlog. Each of our world regions saw orders growth between 2019 and 2020, which was led by strength of the cloud and colocation markets. As I mentioned in the prior chart, the enterprise and IT channel markets are still not back to pre-COVID levels, but they are moving in the right direction. The IT channel momentum is evidenced by our integrated rack solutions revenue having increased every quarter in 2020. While we continue to maintain a high level of vigilance around COVID, our backlog is approximately $450 million higher than it was entering 2020, and we are confident about our position in the market for 2021 and beyond. \n Switching to the supply side. Now I'm pleased to report that most of our manufacturing facilities are operating normally. The measures we have taken and the priority we have placed on safety has allowed us to continue to operate in a relatively normal state amid the disruptions caused by COVID. Sometimes those disruptions are daily. Although we've seen a strong appetite in the broader market for some of the components we use to manufacture our products, I'm proud of how we have diversified our logistics and supply chains globally to mitigate any serious consequences. \n With that, I'll turn it over to David Fallon to walk us through the financials. David? \nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Rob. Starting with Slide 6. This page summarizes our fourth quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were up $134 million or 11.4%, 9.5% when adjusted for a $22 million foreign exchange translation tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders, which were up 9% in the fourth quarter after increasing 15% in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased $38 million or 26%, primarily driven by the flow-through from higher sales and slightly offset by a foreign currency transaction loss, translating into 160 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. Our sales and profitability performance converted into strong free cash flow of $175 million, $86 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. We will review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple of slides. \n Turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $3 million or 0.6%, as growth in telecom was offset by lower services sales, which continue to be negatively impacted by COVID site access issues. Net sales in APAC increased $70 million or 19%, primarily due to continued strong growth in China across most end markets, including data centers, telecommunication and industrials. Geographic locations outside China in APAC were up slightly as we continue to deal with site access challenges in some of those jurisdictions. \n Net sales in EMEA were up $60 million or 25%, almost entirely in the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, driven by several larger colocation projects. \n From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA margin improved in both the Americas and EMEA, but notably in EMEA, where margin increased over 600 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by both higher contribution margin and sales leverage on relatively flat year-over-year fixed costs. Higher contribution margin was primarily due to continued operational and procurement improvement despite a slight negative mix impact from larger projects. \n EMEA adjusted EBITDA margin has improved sequentially each quarter in 2020, reflecting the benefits of past transformational spending, the launch of the Vertiv Operating System and, of course, the leverage benefits of growing the top line while holding fixed cost constant. \n Next, turning to Slide 8. This chart bridges fourth quarter free cash flow from last year. The $86 million increase is primarily a result of higher adjusted EBITDA, lower cash interest payments and lower transformational spending. The $175 million of free cash flow in the quarter was higher than our internal expectations, primarily driven by the timing of cash collections at the end of December versus early January. \n After beginning 2020 with the use of cash in the first quarter of approximately $200 million, we generated $366 million of free cash flow over the last 3 quarters, indicative of the strong cash generation potential of this business. This free cash flow has allowed us to pay down our ABL completely. And in conjunction with the $157 million of cash we received pursuant to the redemption of the public warrants prior to year-end, we increased our liquidity to $964 million at 12/31. And assisted by additional cash received in January from the warrant redemption of approximately $100 million, liquidity currently stands close to $1.1 billion, up from $446 million at the end of the first quarter. \n Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our full year financial results. Net sales were down $60 million or 1.4% from 2019 as higher sales in EMEA and APAC were more than offset by lower sales in the Americas, which was more significantly impacted by COVID site access challenges than the other 2 regions. When looking at our full year sales result, it is instructed to bifurcate the year-over-year comparison. Sales were down 13% in the first half of 2020, but up 10% in the second half, in part driven by more challenging comps in the first half of 2019, but also demonstrating the rebound from COVID challenges and the continued resilient growth in our industry. \n Despite lower full year sales, adjusted EBITDA increased $39 million or 7%, and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 110 basis points as procurement and pricing initiatives drove contribution margin improvement, and fixed costs were down $40 million, aided in part by COVID cost-saving actions launched in the second quarter. \n Finally, on this page, and this is the money chart. Free cash flow improved $171 million from 2019 as we benefited from lower cash interest payments, higher adjusted EBITDA and lower transformation spending. \n Beginning on Page 10, we pivot to looking forward, including with this slide, which discusses our transition to adjusted operating profit as our primary financial metric rather than adjusted EBITDA. For avoidance of doubt, we will not be reporting adjusted EBITDA going forward. We defined adjusted operating profit as operating profit, excluding the impact of intangible amortization expense. Operating profit is a GAAP financial measure that will be included on the face of our income statement, and we show an example on the next slide, with the only adjustment as operating profit, both prospectively and for historical periods, being intangible amortization, which we will also include on the face of our income statement. We believe using adjusted operating profit will greatly simplify our communication and analysis of financial results with analysts and investors. And by eliminating all adjustments other than intangible amortization, we address all components of GAAP financial results, enhance the quality of earnings and we also, of course, eliminate the previously disclosed historical adjustments. \n At the bottom of Slide 10, we provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating profit and then to adjusted operating profit. As you can see, net-net, the differences between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit are the historical add-backs and also other onetime adjustments and depreciation expense. And adjusted operating profit is simply operating profit less the impact of intangible amortization. Last item of note on this slide, we will also be restating our historically reported adjusted earnings per share to remove historical adjustments, except intangible amortization, and we include those reconciliations on Pages 26 and 27 in the appendix. \n Next, moving to Slide 11. This slide illustrates changes in our GAAP income statement presentation going forward, which facilitates our transition to adjusted operating profit. Once again, we will specifically include operating profit, a GAAP measure, on the face of the income statement, and we will also include components of the previously used other deductions net, including amortization of intangibles. A reader will easily be able to calculate adjusted operating profit for any future or historical period with items included in the face of the income statement. And as Rob mentioned, to aid analysts and investors with this transition, which we hope is a once every 10- or 15-year transition, we have included Exhibit 99.2 to our earnings release 8-K, which includes restatements for historical periods, including quarters consistent with this presentation. It also includes revised regional segment information, including reconciliations from historical adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating profit and quarterly and full year reconciliations from historically reported adjusted earnings per share to prospective calculation removing historical adjustments. And as always, Lynne Maxeiner, our VP of Investor Relations, and I will both be available for as any assistance and understanding in facilitating this transition. \n Next, turning to Slide 12. This page summarizes our current financial guidance for 2021. We expect the momentum from the second half of 2020 to continue into 2021, with organic net sales up 7% at the midpoint. We project adjusted operating profit of $575 million at the midpoint, up 68% from prior year and up 26% when pro forma-ed for 2020 discrete items as we illustrate on Slide 13. \n Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 12% at the midpoint, up 420 basis points from 2020 and up 160 basis points on a pro forma basis. Of course, analysts, investors and we, internally, will have to recalibrate margin improvement goals on a relative basis using adjusted operating profit as opposed to adjusted EBITDA, with adjusted operating margin for 2021 about 180 basis points lower than the comparable adjusted EBITDA margin. But of course, the magnitude and substance of our long-term margin improvement goals are unchanged. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 at the midpoint, with disclosure of assumptions included on Slide 28 in the appendix. \n Finally, on this slide, we currently expect strong 2020 free cash flow of $285 million at the midpoint, up approximately $120 million from 2020. And we will provide additional detail on this improvement on Slide 14 coming up. \n Next, Slide 13. This slide illustrates our bridge from 2020 adjusted operating profit of $342 million to project that midpoint 2021 adjusted operating profit guidance of $575 million, growth of approximately 68%. \n To the far left in the bridge, we pro forma 2020 adjusted operating profit for 2 discrete items, $92 million for the 2020 restructuring reserve and asset impairments and $21 million for SPAC transaction costs in the first quarter of 2020. Compared to the resulting $456 million 2020 pro forma figure, we project the operating improvement in 2020 -- in 2021 of about 26%. Components of this operational increase are illustrated in the bridge and include the following anticipated favorable drivers. Higher sales volume, continued contribution margin expansion from procurement pricing and loss initiatives and net benefit from restructuring of approximately $20 million, including $40 million lower cost from the 2020 restructuring program, offset by $20 million of additional restructuring and related project expense in 2021. These tailwinds are offset by higher anticipated fixed costs, as we discussed in our third quarter earnings conference call, including additional investment of $65 million for R&D and growth initiatives and an anticipated $40 million impact from various onetime COVID cost-saving actions in 2020 that don't repeat. \n We normally do not spend significant time explaining an other bar. But in this case, there are quite a few variances going each way included in the other bar on this bridge. Tailwinds include $26 million of the FX transaction loss from 2020 and $40 million of cost savings that we expect in 2021, not related specifically to the 2020 restructuring program. \n Headwinds offsetting headwinds include a $30 million negative foreign exchange impact on fixed costs, $25 million for global merit increases and $11 million of additional depreciation expense. Of particular note, the $51 million of historical add-backs from 2020, which included $13 million for stock compensation expense and $38 million for transformation-related adjustments, as detailed on Slide 19 in the appendix, is almost entirely offset by a combined $50 million of anticipated expense in 2021, equally split between stock compensation expense and continuing IT project implementation costs. \n Transitioning to Slide 14. We include a bridge for the $122 million projected increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021. We expect this increase will primarily be driven by higher adjusted operating profit and lower cash interest payments. These positive drivers will be partially offset by certain headwinds, including 2021 restructuring payments pursuant to the 2020 program, higher CapEx due to delayed 2020 projects and anticipated investment in operational restructuring. In addition, cash taxes are projected to increase due to expected higher profitability in several foreign jurisdictions.\n Overall, our expected 2021 free cash flow will be somewhat normalized, except for the higher cash requirements for restructuring. And CapEx is likely slightly elevated due to push from 2020 projects and incremental spend from the operational restructuring.\n And finally, for me, Slide 15. This slide summarizes our financial guidance for the first quarter, traditionally our lowest sales and profitability quarter and typically a quarter where we use cash. Before diving into numbers, as a reminder, relative to other quarters, last year's first quarter sales and adjusted operating profit were most significantly negatively impacted by COVID, notably in APAC. Even though it is challenging to specifically quantify the exact year-over-year COVID impact since COVID still presents headwinds in parts of our business today, clearly, last year's first quarter is the easiest comp of the 4 quarters. With that in mind, we expect 13% organic growth from the first quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating profit is projected to increase $55 million at the midpoint and adjusted operating margin is expected to increase 500 basis points. \n Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.11 at the midpoint, up $0.76 from last year's first quarter. This year-over-year quarterly earnings per share increase includes a $0.54 benefit from 2 discrete items in the first quarter, including the $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $21 million of SPAC transaction costs. In addition, interest expense in last year's -- I'm sorry, interest expense in this year's first quarter is expected to be $45 million lower than the first quarter of 2019, driving an additional $0.13 per share adjusted EPS benefit. A year-over-year benefit that does not repeat as significantly over the remaining 3 quarters due to the timing of the SPAC transaction and debt refinancing last year.\n With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 16. I wanted to provide some color on the key themes and initiatives we shared with you on our earnings calls over the past year. First, our focus is on the top line. We continue to strengthen all of our customer relationships, but especially with providers in the cloud and colocation space. Doing so has led to order increases in 2020. Though large projects with cloud and colocation customers will always ebb and flow, we are gaining greater visibility into the future needs of our customers, which will translate into our ability to meet future demand and win projects down the road. Furthermore, we continue to hone our go-to-market efforts in the IT channel area. We saw the greatest traction occur in the United States and the impact got stronger as the year went on.\n Secondly, we are piloting the Vertiv Operating System, known as VOS, in 2 of our manufacturing facilities. Already, we are experiencing improved performance and favorable results as we formalize and standardize the way we work. The rollout globally, as we've said, will take time, but I'm pleased with the early results that we're seeing.\n David talked about margin expansion in his comments, and I'm very pleased with our performance in this area. Our sourcing capabilities have continued to improve. Our pricing initiatives have continued to yield favorable results, and our restructuring actions announced last quarter are now in full flight. The foundation we have established and the trajectory that we are on gives me confidence in our ability to achieve the expansion plans we laid out a year ago.\n Finally, and maybe my personal favorite, VPD, or Vertiv Product Development, progress. We continue to focus and fund our research and development programs. Even though we couldn't -- or had limited travel in 2020 imposed because of COVID, we still conducted the Vertiv User Experience, VUE, sessions to bring us closer to our customers and help us become more stronger strategic partners for the long term. We have seen the pace of new product and service introductions increase year-over-year. And in 2021, there'll be no difference. In addition to these real-time results, we have also started to do some seed planning in a few future targeted areas to ensure we continue to be on the cutting-edge in our industry.\n Now turning to Slide 17. I'm very proud of the Vertiv team and what we've accomplished over the last 12 months. We delivered on our commitments. We demonstrated we are a great company in a growing industry. We have executed on many key activities, which have implemented many strategic -- and implemented many strategic initiatives, which will serve us both well in the short-term and in the long term. To all of our employees on the call today, thank you for the dedication and tireless effort to take care of our customers. To all of our investors, thank you for your support over the past year and being with us on today's call.\n I'll now turn the call over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: Yes, I think the change in the reporting actually will be positive over time and simplify things. There's a fair amount of confusion here this morning, but from what I can tell, you bridged to something pretty close to where consensus was. So thanks for all the restates. \n I wanted to talk about the normalization of cash flow a little bit, if we could. And I understand there's some pressure here in 2021, as you lay out in the bridge. We end up with free cash flow in 2021 that's on the low side relative to adjusted EPS or EBITDA or revenues. And I just wondered your view if you give any context on once we work our way through 2021 here, some of these items normalize, how you would kind of frame up the kind of the ongoing free cash flow picture? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. This is David, and thanks for the feedback. So I would point out 2 things in 2020 cash flow that are somewhat anomalistic. So the first and most significant is the cash required for restructuring. So we had anticipated to have approximately a $60 million cash outlay in 2021 for restructuring programs. Our current estimate is closer to $70 million, and $50 million of that is embedded in the restructuring cash payments bridge item on Slide 14. And then we have another a $10 million to $20 million included in adjusted operating profit for 2021 projects. So that's about 20 -- or about a $70 million cash outflow. We'll always have some outflow for restructuring from a cash basis, but that's probably high by a good $50 million.\n The other item I'd point out is CapEx. I think historically, we've kind of provided go-forward direction of CapEx in the $75 million range, we're guiding to $95 million next year. And a lot of good projects are included in that $95 million, but it also includes some projects that were pushed from 2020. So if I were doing a model, I probably wouldn't include $95 million going forward, but I would include more than $75 million. My guess is that we will settle in right around $85 million.\n All the other items, including cash interest, if anything, that should decline going forward. Cash taxes probably will increase. Working capital is one item that we still have a lot of work to do, and we see some opportunity going forward. But other than restructuring and CapEx, I would say 2021 is somewhat normalized. \nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And just one other one for me, and I'll pass it on. On the enterprise related activity and, I guess, the small signs of some additional life that you commented on. Can you provide any additional color on your visibility there? Can you see a pipeline developing in kind of bid and proposal activity? Just wondering if you could put a little bit of kind of firmer point on that for us, how you expect the year to play out. \nRob Johnson: Sure. This is Rob. Yes. What I'd say is, we always talk to the fact that we take a look at our pipeline growth, that's always the leading indicator. And even that is pre-activity on quoting, as you mentioned, which is exactly that. We've seen pipeline expand, exiting out of 2020. So that gives us comfort that the enterprise will begin to recover. Activity is intense in the design area with both electrical and mechanical contractors. So again, that gives me a reason to believe that we will see that recovery. It's just a matter of if and when -- not if, but when people do kind of get out of this COVID [ fog ] and start spending again. But the activity looks good and gives me confidence. And then that's globally, it's not -- and we've seen probably a quicker recovery on the enterprise in, let's say, Asia, and Europe is spotty. And then Americas has probably been the lowest. But overall, the pipeline looks good, and the activity is -- we're very active there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: Maybe we can start with the outlook. Thinking about normalizing towards contribution margins beyond 2022, there's obviously still quite a bit of noise here in '21. So when you think about sustainable levels of restructuring in this business, are you guys going to be factoring in like $20 million or so a year on an ongoing basis? And I guess, similarly, is R&D kind of getting to the point where you're reaching your medium-term run rate? Or do you think that there still needs to be a step-up in R&D beyond 2021? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Nicole. This is Dave. I'll certainly address the restructuring question, and I'll ask Rob to address R&D. Our plan at this point, especially as it relates to the Vertiv Operating System is related to continuous improvement, whether you can equate that to continues restructuring, I think that's probably semantical. But we will continue to invest dollars going forward to take dollars out of the business.\n So I wouldn't want to specifically commit to a dollar amount per year. I think we mentioned for 2021, we're investing an additional $20 million on top of the 2020 restructuring program. That's probably a good starting point. But if there are projects out there with returns, we potentially could invest more than that. If there's a -- there aren't projects in any particular year, could be a little bit lower. But I think that $20 million probably is a good starting point. And as it relates to R&D, I'll pass it on to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Yes. And Nicole, as part of our stated strategy, and we talked about it on the road show, we plan to take R&D up to 6%. Innovation is our vector of differentiation and will allow us to get that margin expansion, and there's a lot of call adjacencies and other the areas that we can participate in. So what we expect, while you've seen a fairly large ramp to catch up to that 6%, we expect 6% of revenue going forward to be in the R&D space so that we can be that innovative leader and look at other adjacencies as well. We expect that, that will produce long-term results over time. R&D does take a little while. Some of our products in the channel space will see benefits within the year. Some of the larger projects we see within 12 to 18 months. But we're very excited about the opportunities that we have more R&D projects, I would say, than we have funding. Our collaboration efforts have proven to be successful with the colo and hyperscale allowing us to design in and drive a better margin profile. \nDavid Cote: Nicole, this is Dave, just kind of maybe putting the 2 points together. At the end of the day, we're sticking with our strategy to grow sales and hold fixed costs constant. And that creates a lot of room for both margin expansion and reinvestment. So we still plan on doing both, not just in '21, but long into the future. \nNicole DeBlase: Got it. And then just for the follow-up, what have you guys embedded for pricing for 2021? And I guess further to that, is the expectation that you can offset recent raw material inflation with pricing? Or is there any sort of price/cost headwind embedded in the guidance? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. Nicole, it's Gary Niederpruem. So I would say, if you reflect back on pricing for 2019, we had a pretty good year. I think we've told everybody we were about $20 million still positive. In 2020, we were somewhere in that $15 million to $20 million range. And our expectation is that for '21, we will have positive price as well. Certainly some headwinds coming from commodity and inflationary aspects all around the globe. But we feel pretty good about where we sit right now to continue passing price along. Whether it's going to be in the same range of what we're able to do in '19 or '20, not quite sure just yet, but we'll certainly be on the plus side of that equation from where we sit today. \nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. \nScott Davis: I didn't hear anything and didn't expect to hear anything on M&A in your prepared remarks, but it's worth asking the question. You're delevering pretty quickly. Is there an opportunity to start to play offense perhaps on bolt-ons and perhaps even stuff that's a little bit larger than what you've historically looked at? \nRob Johnson: Sure. Scott, thanks for the question. Our stated strategy and what we've talked about when we were out raising the pipe was we do have a robust list of potential targets that could be nice bolt-ons for adjacencies or completing a global product line. We'll continue to look at those. And if it makes sense, it hasn't been our first priority. Our first priority was to pay down debt and look at acquisitions as something as opportunistic as they come. And like Dave Cote has always said, they don't always present themselves when we want them to, but we continue to look and follow and track those companies that we might be interested in. But again, it isn't our first priority to go out and buy something. We do like the optionality that we have today, with the strengthening of our liquidity, to be able to look at various things, but we just have to take those as they come. \nScott Davis: Okay. Fair enough. And then just to be clear on the capital spending side, is it -- when you think about your spending, and I imagine there's a mix here of things you're spending on, but is it more weighted towards new capacity or kind of tuning up upgrading IT spend, et cetera, on existing capacity? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David. So I would say it's probably split in 3 different buckets, and certainly not equally split, but we are continuing investment in IT. And that's something that we'll be launching an ERP system in the Americas in 2021, and that takes continued capital. \n Operational, it's probably a little bit over 1/3 of the overall spending. Some of that is -- continues to be maintenance spending, but also related to some of the restructuring that we announced last year. And that CapEx will be more skewed towards the back half of '21, and we'll see benefits from that in 2022. \n And the last bucket is related to the Vertiv Product Development, our R&D initiatives. And that's something -- could be in the range of $20 million, $25 million that we would anticipate to continue going forward.\n So overall, as I mentioned to Jeff, the $95 million for this year probably is a little bit elevated. But this spending, most of it is investment-related, meaning there is a return as opposed to just continuing maintenance CapEx. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: So just curious on the switch from EBITDA to EBITA, effectively. Does that map to a way you're changing internally in the way that you're measuring and compensating execs internally or is it just like a change in presentation for us folks?\n And I do think that some investors are struggling to compare like-for-like. So just on that regard, it looks like it was about $70 million of expenses that would have been added back in FY '20, stock-based comp, transformation costs and restructuring, those are 3 buckets that I can see. Can you just confirm that, [ even a ballpark ], that would be helpful? \nDavid Fallon: Yes, this is David. So Nigel, what I can say is that the way we report to the Street is going to be exactly the way we scorecard ourselves internally. So we had used adjusted EBITDA for internal basis for measuring and compensating. And we are definitely transitioning that to adjusted operating profit as well.\n On a go-forward basis, if you were to look at 2021, adjusted operating profit versus what we had included for adjusted EBITDA for '21, so the $660 million versus the $575 million, that difference is simply depreciation. So on a go-forward basis, effectively, what we're doing is holding ourselves accountable. For capital spending and the resulting depreciation going forward.\n So of course, I think a lot of the confusion comes looking at the historical and some of the historical adjustments. But going forward, the only difference between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit is going to be that depreciation. And of course, very critical is not having any adjustments going forward. So we're holding ourselves fully accountable for any expense that hits the P&L. And the only adjustment from GAAP is going to be that intangible amortization. \nNigel Coe: Right. But what I'm saying, the specific part of that question was, if we were in FY '20, just so that investors can compare like-for-like and get an underlying incremental margin, it looks like $70 million of costs are being fully absorbed in your FY '21 plan that would have been added back ordinarily. Is that the right [ direction ]? \nDavid Fallon: I think that is directionally fair. Certainly, if you look at a couple of the items that I mentioned related to Slide 13, we will have $25 million of stock compensation costs in 2021. That is a cost that, in 2020, was treated as a historical add-back. In addition, we have about $25 million of IT-related expense that historically we -- and these are implementation costs related to new projects. That $25 million would have been included as an add-back for 2020. So that's $50 million right off the bat. \n The $20 million additional that you're referring to, I believe, is restructuring expense. And that is something, if you compare it to the $70 million historical add-back from the third quarter last year, also would have been treated as -- or be subject to be treated as an add-back. So if that's how you're developing the $70 million, I would agree with that math. \nNigel Coe: That's exactly right. That's helpful. And then a quick one on the $65 million worth of investment spending. Where does that take R&D? I know R&D targets a specific percent of sales, but where does that mark-to-market R&D as a portion of sales in 2021? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So -- and we'll be filing our 10-K on Monday. Our R&D expense for -- and we'll disclose R&D expense. But our R&D expense for 2020 was $230 million, which was about 5.2% of sales. That $65 million figure on Slide 13, about half of that is R&D and the other half of it is based on growth initiatives. So assuming an additional $30 million spend and the $4,775 million guidance for next year takes R&D as a percentage of sales up to close to 5.5%. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess I have two as well. First off, when I think about the $65 million of incremental expenses in calendar '21 that have been made, can you just talk about how you think about payback on these investments? Do I think about Vertiv inherent growth being better in the calendar '22 out-years? Or do I think about a step-up in conversion margins? How do I think about that payback on these investments over the next few years? \nRob Johnson: Sure. Amit, it's Rob here. What we've said on these investments is that they -- some -- as I mentioned earlier, some of the projects take a little bit longer than others, but the reason for investing is that we -- so we can outpace the actual market growth. So by investing in these new product categories or new product areas, it will accelerate our growth at 1.5x the market growth rate. \n And those things happen over a period of time, channel-type products, more IT-based products, 6 to 12 months, we began to see a payback on those. And then the larger projects -- products, typically 12 to 18 months and you begin to see the sales on those. And they could be things like a larger UPS -- UPS is larger, megawatt UPSs or larger cooling or thermal management units. So those things take typically a little bit longer to get out globally, but it will yield over the next several years, our ability to outpace the market growth rate. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then just as a follow-up. When I think about your web scale -- hyperscale colo customer base, can you just touch on do you think you are at this point over or under-indexed on a market share basis in that bucket? And what are the steps you can take to drive up your share gains in this market over the next few years? \nRob Johnson: Sure. So we always -- great question. We always kind of combine colo and hyperscale because, as we've talked about in the past, outside the U.S., the hyperscalers typically work with colo, colocation companies, for their data center builds. And inside the U.S., they typically build themselves. And then there's a mixture of that. \n I would say there's room for growth in both. If you just look at our overall market share, we have the ability to grow, and we think our collaboration method and model, working closely with our customers to design those products will give us the ability to take additional share. We had some very nice wins in conversion in 2020 of maybe some colocation companies we haven't worked with in the past. So we think there's plenty of room for growth. And as the expansion happens on a global basis, you'll see that the opportunities there. \n We don't necessarily sell our full entire product set in all of the hyperscalers today. So there's room for improvement there as well, whether it's a larger battery backup system or a larger [ STS ] or more power distribution, there's room for growth there, too. So we're certainly not at a saturation level and have the ability to continue to grow our share there. And that's one of the reasons why we're investing in R&D so heavily. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Lance Vitanza of Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: First off, the revenue performance and the revenue guidance relative to the industry growth that you've discussed in the past suggests you're taking significant market share. So my question is, where exactly are you seeing these gains? Is this mostly from taking business away from the smaller companies that we necessarily haven't heard of? Or are you also taking share from the Schneiders and the Eatons of the world? \nRob Johnson: So great question, Lance. This is Rob. What I'd say is it's a combination of both. When we look at the -- some of the share gain that we're seeing, certainly, there's a lot of regional players, smaller regional players that we compete against. And because of our global nature and filling out some product gaps that maybe we had, we're able to take that. \n But I think as it relates to Eaton and Schneider, we compete with them, and it's different in every region, right, how competitive they are or they aren't. But I would say, in general, we're -- we believe we're growing in both cases and taking some share. I know just looking at some of the channel statistics in the IT channel side of things, well, a lot of people were down. I think our overall decline in 2020 was much less than our competitors in some cases, therefore, showing that we took some share there as well. So it's kind of like being in the channel and in the colocation, hyperscale. \nLance Vitanza: Great. Okay. And then my other question is actually with respect to Slide 13. I wanted to focus on this 26% projected increase in adjusted operating profit. I mean that's the metric that we're going to be looking at going forward. So I think that's where we want to focus. \n And I guess the question is, what should we think the potential there is for that kind of growth to be sustained beyond 2021? And I'm not asking for guidance, but I'd love to get your thoughts there. \n And if nothing else, perhaps we could talk about the $40 million of COVID savings that are sort of being restored in 2021. Well, clearly, that, I would think, that's not going to be recurring in '22 and beyond. On the other hand, it does sound like the growth in the R&D investments are going to continue to increase for the next several years. But that being said, I mean, how should we be thinking about kind of that 26% growth? Is that their anomaly or just indicative of what the earnings potential is for this business? \nDavid Fallon: Yes, this is David. I'll take a shot and then ask Rob to comment as well. So one thing that I do want to reaffirm for everybody on the call and all investors and analysts is that we are still fully committed to the margin improvement goals that we have talked to historically. So just because we're switching to adjusted operating profit from adjusted EBITDA, it doesn't change the intermediate and long-term goals that we have for margin expansion. \n Now we will have to recalibrate. So I think we historically have talked about getting to 17% adjusted EBITDA. And I think an equivalent number for adjusted operating profit is somewhere between 15% and 16%, but we're committed to using 16% for that intermediate goal, and there's no reason we can't get to 20% in the long run. So I think we've used that as kind of the long-term hurdle. That has not changed with this transition to adjusted operating profit. And so I think that very much works into your question about the future expectations for adjusted operating profit growth. \n Certainly, we see the growth in adjusted operating profit being enhanced and growing with the top line. So as long as we continue to grow that top line in -- above market while expanding margins, there's no reason, mathematically, that we can't continue similar growth going forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Obin, Bank of America. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. I wanted to ask about what your guidance assumes around the services revenue, given that you're still having site access issues here in, I guess, January, February? \nRob Johnson: I'll take a first stab at that and then, David, finish that off. But we will continue to deal as COVID is an issue with site access and -- but we expect that year-over-year, we've got in the plan that we will be growing our services revenue as part of our overall growth strategy. Again, could be to overall COVID, we can't predict what that looks like, but we've been able to navigate pretty well around that. There's just various areas and hotspots that we'll have to deal with from time to time. But we do expect to have and built into our plan is growth in the services for 2021. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then as a follow-up. Maybe could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the enterprise space? What are the areas that you're seeing the improved demand and what's still weak? \nRob Johnson: Yes. I would say it's going to be by industry vertical, right? We're still seeing, of course, travel and entertainment being one that hasn't recovered. I'm not sure when that will recover. Certainly, other verticals like retail, big-box stores, we've seen the spending began there as people continue to compete for that kind of e-tail local distribution. \n Certainly on the financial vertical, we see spending beginning to pick up there in the financial space. And then the other areas of positive signs is around education and government spending would be the other ones that we would see from there. So while some sectors are down. In general, those are kind of the areas that we're seeing some bright spots in today. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Delaney, Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Yes. First, just hoping to dig into the demand environment a little bit more. The company reported very strong backlog growth of at least 32%, and that's now at a high level. As you're thinking about the backlog into 2021, do you think you're going to be able to sustain backlogs at this type of a high level or perhaps even grow it? Or would you think you're potentially going to work the backlog down a little bit this year? \nRob Johnson: Mark, I'll start and then I'll let David come in. We're seeing and continue to see strong demand both in Q3 and Q4. If you listen to both hyperscale and colocation, their business is going quite well, and that's a big driver in driving our backlog on projects. I think our global expansion, what we're seeing in China in the telecom side of things. Certainly, India now has come on the radar map to -- for hyperscale and colocation. So I guess what I'd say is we expect upper single-digit growth in the order rates and expect to continue to see that to happen. \nMark Delaney: That's helpful. And my follow-up question was on the channel opportunity. And Rob, you mentioned a few times throughout the call about some strength that you're seeing in that market begin to materialize. Is that more a function of the macroeconomic environment and some of those types of customers coming back? Or would you attribute it as well to some of the company-specific efforts that Vertiv has underway to better penetrate those channel customers? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Great question, Mark. No, I attribute it to kind of the execution and some of the programs and some of the products that we brought out. We've got some unique products in our power distribution, IT power distribution side. We've been pretty aggressive on our lithium-ion offerings and making sure that that's available. So some of the programs that we've targeted are paying off. And we've had, as we mentioned, quarter-to-quarter -- year-over-year still was down. But quarter-to-quarter, we've seen the improvements. So we feel like we're on the right trajectory with both new product intros, the programs that we're offering, we've certainly simplified our partner portals, project registration being that, hopefully, easier button for our customers to come diverted for that. But we're taking that same, and we've kind of globalized that same strategy to Europe, which is a little bit further behind and then driving it into the rest of Asia and China. So as you know, this is a big part of our strategy. This does take time. We've chosen to do it organically. And -- but we believe that our current strategy and trajectory will yield the results ultimately that we're looking for. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Can you give us a little more color into the continued strength you're seeing specifically in EMEA? You've been talking about working on some large colocation projects for a while now. Do these projects continue through '21? And I know in the past, you've talked about regional data sovereignty driving growth. So how sustainable are these trends there? And what else is going on in the region that's leading to such good performance in EMEA specifically? \nRob Johnson: Absolutely, Andy. And great catch on the EMEA side of things. What we see typically with hyperscale and colo is typically rushing to various parts of the world. And so there'll be, well, let's say, maybe not as much spending in the U.S. going on or growth. We have seen that in Europe. And I firmly believe the data sovereignty, people want data centers in their country, governments want that data there. They don't want it filling in data centers in the U.S. nor in China. \n So I think there's a lot of build-out. If you take -- just look at the number of data centers, number of cellphone users, number of broadband access in Europe versus what you've got in the U.S., I think we have a lot of runway ahead of ourselves as it relates to Europe and the builds that still have to happen there. \n The Brexit thing has driven lots of data center builds and parts that we didn't think were necessarily going to happen. So we continue to see strength, I think, over the next couple of years in the European side of things. We have taken some share there. We've had some new customers that we haven't traditionally done business with in the past. So the customer acquisition has been good there. But I'll tell you, if you look at globally, I'm pretty excited about, whether it's Europe or Middle East and Africa, South America, again, a lot of chatter and talk in India around colocation, hyperscale finally coming there. They're so underserved.\n So I think we've got a lot of runway in other parts of the world, plus what's still happening here in the U.S. Not that the U.S. isn't going to grow, it's going to continue to grow. But I think we'll see outside, Europe's leading the way now. But I think you'll begin to see some of the Asia countries, and certainly, India begin to pop up on the radar screen as nice area. So all in all, I look at the next several years as we've got a fairly healthy market in front of us. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful. And then actually following-up on Asia Pac. Just in terms of margin, you've talked about some margin pressure there coming from product mix, timing of large projects. How should we think about the margin progression going forward? Do large products start to ramp and that will help your margin there? You've talked about supply chain stresses, does that hurt you in Asia Pac? Any more color would be helpful. \nRob Johnson: Yes. I'll start off there. And then, David, if you want to come in over the top. I would say, in general, we're probably weighted more towards the telecom side of things in parts of Asia Pac. And that tends to be kind of lower than fleet average margin that we see as we continue to drive innovation and invest in innovation specifically in China, we expect to be able to get paid for that innovation as we go forward. So we're certainly focused on getting that closer to the fleet average. But there is a mix difference as it relates to the types of products we're selling there today. \n So channel is going to be an important part of our success there. And specifically, China, I think, is the driver from a margin perspective as it relates to areas of focus, being more local and driving that local innovation is going to be an important part of what we're doing in 2021 and beyond.\n David, any other thoughts? \nDavid Fallon: No, I think you hit it pretty well, Rob. And certainly, there is lower margin you get with certain lower -- larger projects, but we have tailwinds from a mix perspective from both the channel and some of the initiatives to grow services. We certainly aren't relying on mix to be a huge margin-enhancement opportunity going forward. I think we're assuming relatively flat, but there is that potential it could actually be a tailwind for us. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks. \nRob Johnson: Thank you, operator, and I'm going to close the call by thanking our 20,000 employees around the world for working hard every day to take care of our customers. We appreciate everyone's time today. Please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you very much for your support. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes. Nicole, it's Gary Niederpruem. So I would say, if you reflect back on pricing for 2019, we had a pretty good year. I think we've told everybody we were about $20 million still positive. In 2020, we were somewhere in that $15 million to $20 million range. And our expectation is that for '21, we will have positive price as well. Certainly some headwinds coming from commodity and inflationary aspects all around the globe. But we feel pretty good about where we sit right now to continue passing price along. Whether it's going to be in the same range of what we're able to do in '19 or '20, not quite sure just yet, but we'll certainly be on the plus side of that equation from where we sit today."

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Starting with Slide 6. This page summarizes our fourth quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were up $134 million or 11.4%, 9.5% when adjusted for a $22 million foreign exchange translation tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders, which were up 9% in the fourth quarter after increasing 15% in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased $38 million or 26%, primarily driven by the flow-through from higher sales and slightly offset by a foreign currency transaction loss, translating into 160 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin. Our sales and profitability performance converted into strong free cash flow of $175 million, $86 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. We will review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple of slides. \n Turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $3 million or 0.6%, as growth in telecom was offset by lower services sales, which continue to be negatively impacted by COVID site access issues. Net sales in APAC increased $70 million or 19%, primarily due to continued strong growth in China across most end markets, including data centers, telecommunication and industrials. Geographic locations outside China in APAC were up slightly as we continue to deal with site access challenges in some of those jurisdictions. \n Net sales in EMEA were up $60 million or 25%, almost entirely in the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, driven by several larger colocation projects. \n From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA margin improved in both the Americas and EMEA, but notably in EMEA, where margin increased over 600 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. This improvement was driven by both higher contribution margin and sales leverage on relatively flat year-over-year fixed costs. Higher contribution margin was primarily due to continued operational and procurement improvement despite a slight negative mix impact from larger projects. \n EMEA adjusted EBITDA margin has improved sequentially each quarter in 2020, reflecting the benefits of past transformational spending, the launch of the Vertiv Operating System and, of course, the leverage benefits of growing the top line while holding fixed cost constant. \n Next, turning to Slide 8. This chart bridges fourth quarter free cash flow from last year. The $86 million increase is primarily a result of higher adjusted EBITDA, lower cash interest payments and lower transformational spending. The $175 million of free cash flow in the quarter was higher than our internal expectations, primarily driven by the timing of cash collections at the end of December versus early January. \n After beginning 2020 with the use of cash in the first quarter of approximately $200 million, we generated $366 million of free cash flow over the last 3 quarters, indicative of the strong cash generation potential of this business. This free cash flow has allowed us to pay down our ABL completely. And in conjunction with the $157 million of cash we received pursuant to the redemption of the public warrants prior to year-end, we increased our liquidity to $964 million at 12/31. And assisted by additional cash received in January from the warrant redemption of approximately $100 million, liquidity currently stands close to $1.1 billion, up from $446 million at the end of the first quarter. \n Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our full year financial results. Net sales were down $60 million or 1.4% from 2019 as higher sales in EMEA and APAC were more than offset by lower sales in the Americas, which was more significantly impacted by COVID site access challenges than the other 2 regions. When looking at our full year sales result, it is instructed to bifurcate the year-over-year comparison. Sales were down 13% in the first half of 2020, but up 10% in the second half, in part driven by more challenging comps in the first half of 2019, but also demonstrating the rebound from COVID challenges and the continued resilient growth in our industry. \n Despite lower full year sales, adjusted EBITDA increased $39 million or 7%, and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 110 basis points as procurement and pricing initiatives drove contribution margin improvement, and fixed costs were down $40 million, aided in part by COVID cost-saving actions launched in the second quarter. \n Finally, on this page, and this is the money chart. Free cash flow improved $171 million from 2019 as we benefited from lower cash interest payments, higher adjusted EBITDA and lower transformation spending. \n Beginning on Page 10, we pivot to looking forward, including with this slide, which discusses our transition to adjusted operating profit as our primary financial metric rather than adjusted EBITDA. For avoidance of doubt, we will not be reporting adjusted EBITDA going forward. We defined adjusted operating profit as operating profit, excluding the impact of intangible amortization expense. Operating profit is a GAAP financial measure that will be included on the face of our income statement, and we show an example on the next slide, with the only adjustment as operating profit, both prospectively and for historical periods, being intangible amortization, which we will also include on the face of our income statement. We believe using adjusted operating profit will greatly simplify our communication and analysis of financial results with analysts and investors. And by eliminating all adjustments other than intangible amortization, we address all components of GAAP financial results, enhance the quality of earnings and we also, of course, eliminate the previously disclosed historical adjustments. \n At the bottom of Slide 10, we provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating profit and then to adjusted operating profit. As you can see, net-net, the differences between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit are the historical add-backs and also other onetime adjustments and depreciation expense. And adjusted operating profit is simply operating profit less the impact of intangible amortization. Last item of note on this slide, we will also be restating our historically reported adjusted earnings per share to remove historical adjustments, except intangible amortization, and we include those reconciliations on Pages 26 and 27 in the appendix. \n Next, moving to Slide 11. This slide illustrates changes in our GAAP income statement presentation going forward, which facilitates our transition to adjusted operating profit. Once again, we will specifically include operating profit, a GAAP measure, on the face of the income statement, and we will also include components of the previously used other deductions net, including amortization of intangibles. A reader will easily be able to calculate adjusted operating profit for any future or historical period with items included in the face of the income statement. And as Rob mentioned, to aid analysts and investors with this transition, which we hope is a once every 10- or 15-year transition, we have included Exhibit 99.2 to our earnings release 8-K, which includes restatements for historical periods, including quarters consistent with this presentation. It also includes revised regional segment information, including reconciliations from historical adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating profit and quarterly and full year reconciliations from historically reported adjusted earnings per share to prospective calculation removing historical adjustments. And as always, Lynne Maxeiner, our VP of Investor Relations, and I will both be available for as any assistance and understanding in facilitating this transition. \n Next, turning to Slide 12. This page summarizes our current financial guidance for 2021. We expect the momentum from the second half of 2020 to continue into 2021, with organic net sales up 7% at the midpoint. We project adjusted operating profit of $575 million at the midpoint, up 68% from prior year and up 26% when pro forma-ed for 2020 discrete items as we illustrate on Slide 13. \n Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 12% at the midpoint, up 420 basis points from 2020 and up 160 basis points on a pro forma basis. Of course, analysts, investors and we, internally, will have to recalibrate margin improvement goals on a relative basis using adjusted operating profit as opposed to adjusted EBITDA, with adjusted operating margin for 2021 about 180 basis points lower than the comparable adjusted EBITDA margin. But of course, the magnitude and substance of our long-term margin improvement goals are unchanged. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 at the midpoint, with disclosure of assumptions included on Slide 28 in the appendix. \n Finally, on this slide, we currently expect strong 2020 free cash flow of $285 million at the midpoint, up approximately $120 million from 2020. And we will provide additional detail on this improvement on Slide 14 coming up. \n Next, Slide 13. This slide illustrates our bridge from 2020 adjusted operating profit of $342 million to project that midpoint 2021 adjusted operating profit guidance of $575 million, growth of approximately 68%. \n To the far left in the bridge, we pro forma 2020 adjusted operating profit for 2 discrete items, $92 million for the 2020 restructuring reserve and asset impairments and $21 million for SPAC transaction costs in the first quarter of 2020. Compared to the resulting $456 million 2020 pro forma figure, we project the operating improvement in 2020 -- in 2021 of about 26%. Components of this operational increase are illustrated in the bridge and include the following anticipated favorable drivers. Higher sales volume, continued contribution margin expansion from procurement pricing and loss initiatives and net benefit from restructuring of approximately $20 million, including $40 million lower cost from the 2020 restructuring program, offset by $20 million of additional restructuring and related project expense in 2021. These tailwinds are offset by higher anticipated fixed costs, as we discussed in our third quarter earnings conference call, including additional investment of $65 million for R&D and growth initiatives and an anticipated $40 million impact from various onetime COVID cost-saving actions in 2020 that don't repeat. \n We normally do not spend significant time explaining an other bar. But in this case, there are quite a few variances going each way included in the other bar on this bridge. Tailwinds include $26 million of the FX transaction loss from 2020 and $40 million of cost savings that we expect in 2021, not related specifically to the 2020 restructuring program. \n Headwinds offsetting headwinds include a $30 million negative foreign exchange impact on fixed costs, $25 million for global merit increases and $11 million of additional depreciation expense. Of particular note, the $51 million of historical add-backs from 2020, which included $13 million for stock compensation expense and $38 million for transformation-related adjustments, as detailed on Slide 19 in the appendix, is almost entirely offset by a combined $50 million of anticipated expense in 2021, equally split between stock compensation expense and continuing IT project implementation costs. \n Transitioning to Slide 14. We include a bridge for the $122 million projected increase in free cash flow from 2020 to 2021. We expect this increase will primarily be driven by higher adjusted operating profit and lower cash interest payments. These positive drivers will be partially offset by certain headwinds, including 2021 restructuring payments pursuant to the 2020 program, higher CapEx due to delayed 2020 projects and anticipated investment in operational restructuring. In addition, cash taxes are projected to increase due to expected higher profitability in several foreign jurisdictions.\n Overall, our expected 2021 free cash flow will be somewhat normalized, except for the higher cash requirements for restructuring. And CapEx is likely slightly elevated due to push from 2020 projects and incremental spend from the operational restructuring.\n And finally, for me, Slide 15. This slide summarizes our financial guidance for the first quarter, traditionally our lowest sales and profitability quarter and typically a quarter where we use cash. Before diving into numbers, as a reminder, relative to other quarters, last year's first quarter sales and adjusted operating profit were most significantly negatively impacted by COVID, notably in APAC. Even though it is challenging to specifically quantify the exact year-over-year COVID impact since COVID still presents headwinds in parts of our business today, clearly, last year's first quarter is the easiest comp of the 4 quarters. With that in mind, we expect 13% organic growth from the first quarter of last year. Our adjusted operating profit is projected to increase $55 million at the midpoint and adjusted operating margin is expected to increase 500 basis points. \n Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.11 at the midpoint, up $0.76 from last year's first quarter. This year-over-year quarterly earnings per share increase includes a $0.54 benefit from 2 discrete items in the first quarter, including the $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $21 million of SPAC transaction costs. In addition, interest expense in last year's -- I'm sorry, interest expense in this year's first quarter is expected to be $45 million lower than the first quarter of 2019, driving an additional $0.13 per share adjusted EPS benefit. A year-over-year benefit that does not repeat as significantly over the remaining 3 quarters due to the timing of the SPAC transaction and debt refinancing last year.\n With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. This is David, and thanks for the feedback. So I would point out 2 things in 2020 cash flow that are somewhat anomalistic. So the first and most significant is the cash required for restructuring. So we had anticipated to have approximately a $60 million cash outlay in 2021 for restructuring programs. Our current estimate is closer to $70 million, and $50 million of that is embedded in the restructuring cash payments bridge item on Slide 14. And then we have another a $10 million to $20 million included in adjusted operating profit for 2021 projects. So that's about 20 -- or about a $70 million cash outflow. We'll always have some outflow for restructuring from a cash basis, but that's probably high by a good $50 million.\n The other item I'd point out is CapEx. I think historically, we've kind of provided go-forward direction of CapEx in the $75 million range, we're guiding to $95 million next year. And a lot of good projects are included in that $95 million, but it also includes some projects that were pushed from 2020. So if I were doing a model, I probably wouldn't include $95 million going forward, but I would include more than $75 million. My guess is that we will settle in right around $85 million.\n All the other items, including cash interest, if anything, that should decline going forward. Cash taxes probably will increase. Working capital is one item that we still have a lot of work to do, and we see some opportunity going forward. But other than restructuring and CapEx, I would say 2021 is somewhat normalized. Yes. Thanks, Nicole. This is Dave. I'll certainly address the restructuring question, and I'll ask Rob to address R&D. Our plan at this point, especially as it relates to the Vertiv Operating System is related to continuous improvement, whether you can equate that to continues restructuring, I think that's probably semantical. But we will continue to invest dollars going forward to take dollars out of the business.\n So I wouldn't want to specifically commit to a dollar amount per year. I think we mentioned for 2021, we're investing an additional $20 million on top of the 2020 restructuring program. That's probably a good starting point. But if there are projects out there with returns, we potentially could invest more than that. If there's a -- there aren't projects in any particular year, could be a little bit lower. But I think that $20 million probably is a good starting point. And as it relates to R&D, I'll pass it on to Rob. Yes. This is David. So I would say it's probably split in 3 different buckets, and certainly not equally split, but we are continuing investment in IT. And that's something that we'll be launching an ERP system in the Americas in 2021, and that takes continued capital. \n Operational, it's probably a little bit over 1/3 of the overall spending. Some of that is -- continues to be maintenance spending, but also related to some of the restructuring that we announced last year. And that CapEx will be more skewed towards the back half of '21, and we'll see benefits from that in 2022. \n And the last bucket is related to the Vertiv Product Development, our R&D initiatives. And that's something -- could be in the range of $20 million, $25 million that we would anticipate to continue going forward.\n So overall, as I mentioned to Jeff, the $95 million for this year probably is a little bit elevated. But this spending, most of it is investment-related, meaning there is a return as opposed to just continuing maintenance CapEx. Yes, this is David. So Nigel, what I can say is that the way we report to the Street is going to be exactly the way we scorecard ourselves internally. So we had used adjusted EBITDA for internal basis for measuring and compensating. And we are definitely transitioning that to adjusted operating profit as well.\n On a go-forward basis, if you were to look at 2021, adjusted operating profit versus what we had included for adjusted EBITDA for '21, so the $660 million versus the $575 million, that difference is simply depreciation. So on a go-forward basis, effectively, what we're doing is holding ourselves accountable. For capital spending and the resulting depreciation going forward.\n So of course, I think a lot of the confusion comes looking at the historical and some of the historical adjustments. But going forward, the only difference between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit is going to be that depreciation. And of course, very critical is not having any adjustments going forward. So we're holding ourselves fully accountable for any expense that hits the P&L. And the only adjustment from GAAP is going to be that intangible amortization. I think that is directionally fair. Certainly, if you look at a couple of the items that I mentioned related to Slide 13, we will have $25 million of stock compensation costs in 2021. That is a cost that, in 2020, was treated as a historical add-back. In addition, we have about $25 million of IT-related expense that historically we -- and these are implementation costs related to new projects. That $25 million would have been included as an add-back for 2020. So that's $50 million right off the bat. \n The $20 million additional that you're referring to, I believe, is restructuring expense. And that is something, if you compare it to the $70 million historical add-back from the third quarter last year, also would have been treated as -- or be subject to be treated as an add-back. So if that's how you're developing the $70 million, I would agree with that math. Yes. So -- and we'll be filing our 10-K on Monday. Our R&D expense for -- and we'll disclose R&D expense. But our R&D expense for 2020 was $230 million, which was about 5.2% of sales. That $65 million figure on Slide 13, about half of that is R&D and the other half of it is based on growth initiatives. So assuming an additional $30 million spend and the $4,775 million guidance for next year takes R&D as a percentage of sales up to close to 5.5%. Yes, this is David. I'll take a shot and then ask Rob to comment as well. So one thing that I do want to reaffirm for everybody on the call and all investors and analysts is that we are still fully committed to the margin improvement goals that we have talked to historically. So just because we're switching to adjusted operating profit from adjusted EBITDA, it doesn't change the intermediate and long-term goals that we have for margin expansion. \n Now we will have to recalibrate. So I think we historically have talked about getting to 17% adjusted EBITDA. And I think an equivalent number for adjusted operating profit is somewhere between 15% and 16%, but we're committed to using 16% for that intermediate goal, and there's no reason we can't get to 20% in the long run. So I think we've used that as kind of the long-term hurdle. That has not changed with this transition to adjusted operating profit. And so I think that very much works into your question about the future expectations for adjusted operating profit growth. \n Certainly, we see the growth in adjusted operating profit being enhanced and growing with the top line. So as long as we continue to grow that top line in -- above market while expanding margins, there's no reason, mathematically, that we can't continue similar growth going forward. No, I think you hit it pretty well, Rob. And certainly, there is lower margin you get with certain lower -- larger projects, but we have tailwinds from a mix perspective from both the channel and some of the initiatives to grow services. We certainly aren't relying on mix to be a huge margin-enhancement opportunity going forward. I think we're assuming relatively flat, but there is that potential it could actually be a tailwind for us."

            "name": "Rob Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and I truly appreciate your partnership and the good advice you continue to provide to me and my executive leadership team. I also want to thank the Vertiv employees for their efforts in Q4 and throughout last year. They pulled together and demonstrated how our collective efforts can accomplish amazing feats during a very challenging time. They've adopted to a can-do attitude, used creativity, ingenuity and outside-the-box thinking in order to serve our customers during this pandemic. I commend my team, my Board and our many partners for delivering the results I will share with you today. \n Moving to Slide 3. Overall, the demand side of our business was very promising as Q4 sales were up over 11% compared to Q4 of 2019, driven largely by significant growth in the European and Asia Pacific regions. Orders for the quarter were up 9% when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. And I'm pleased to remind you that the orders for Q3 were already up 15% as compared to Q3 of the previous year. \n Our backlog remains at an all-time high and is up $450 million from the end of 2019. We will talk more specifically about the demand side of the business over the next few slides. \n From a profitability standpoint, our adjusted EBITDA was $187 million, which was up over 25% from last year's Q4. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 160 basis points, driven higher by sales, higher contribution margin and lower fixed costs on a percentage basis. Additionally, our free cash flow at the end of Q4 improved over the same time period last year by $86 million to $175 million because of higher earnings and lower transformation spending. \n Turning to the full year results of 2020. We delivered $39 million more in adjusted EBITDA as compared to 2019, with sales down approximately 1%. This equates to 110 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin versus the prior year. Our free cash flow improved $171 million over last year to $163 million, driven primarily by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower cash interest. \n Looking at 2021, we anticipate above-market top line growth, increase in profitability, an even stronger balance sheet, all while continuing to invest significantly in strategic areas like research and development and sales and marketing. \n Finally, I wanted to let you know that we have transitioned to the measure of profitability from adjusted EBITDA to adjusted operating profit. While there are a few moving parts associated with this transition, this is nothing more than continuing on our committed path to keeping our financials and communications as simple as possible. In order to aid the analysts with this transition, we've included Exhibit 99.2 in our 8-K that reconciles all the pertinent information. David will speak to this further during his section as well. \n Turning to Slide 4. We've used this slide over the past few quarters to illustrate what we are seeing in our market environment regarding demand. It's been updated here to reflect how things look today. \n In the cloud and colocation market, we continue to see strong levels of activity in every region, as indicated by the 6 green buttons in the top 2 rows. Emerging digital applications, such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, and that demand benefits us as well. \n In contrast, we see the enterprise and small to medium business continuing to be challenged by COVID, as indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row 3. Its spending continues to be mixed. We commented last quarter that this segment was slightly more positive in October than it was in July, and it's slightly better today than it was in October. The change is subtle, but it is trending in the right direction. \n Switching to the telecom side of things. We see little change from last quarter. However, we are seeing an uptick of 5G deployment in U.S. and parts of Asia. Several of our larger U.S. carriers are continuing to roll out 5G and we expect the rollout to continue for several more quarters. \n Finally, our commercial and industrial business often tracks GDP, but sometimes the quarterly timing can be different. There was a positive movement in a few light commercial and industrial applications over the past few months. The most notable changes we are seeing are taking place in Europe. So certainly some puts and takes, but overall, a strong market picture given our mix of the data center business. The digital applications people use every day continue to become more and more important to daily living as the result of demand increasing for those digital applications so they can be processed, stored and transmitted. This is creating a significant opportunity for our customers and,  consequently, a significant opportunity for Vertiv. \n Moving to Slide 5. To reiterate, the overall demand is strong as evidenced by our order rates and backlog. Each of our world regions saw orders growth between 2019 and 2020, which was led by strength of the cloud and colocation markets. As I mentioned in the prior chart, the enterprise and IT channel markets are still not back to pre-COVID levels, but they are moving in the right direction. The IT channel momentum is evidenced by our integrated rack solutions revenue having increased every quarter in 2020. While we continue to maintain a high level of vigilance around COVID, our backlog is approximately $450 million higher than it was entering 2020, and we are confident about our position in the market for 2021 and beyond. \n Switching to the supply side. Now I'm pleased to report that most of our manufacturing facilities are operating normally. The measures we have taken and the priority we have placed on safety has allowed us to continue to operate in a relatively normal state amid the disruptions caused by COVID. Sometimes those disruptions are daily. Although we've seen a strong appetite in the broader market for some of the components we use to manufacture our products, I'm proud of how we have diversified our logistics and supply chains globally to mitigate any serious consequences. \n With that, I'll turn it over to David Fallon to walk us through the financials. David? Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 16. I wanted to provide some color on the key themes and initiatives we shared with you on our earnings calls over the past year. First, our focus is on the top line. We continue to strengthen all of our customer relationships, but especially with providers in the cloud and colocation space. Doing so has led to order increases in 2020. Though large projects with cloud and colocation customers will always ebb and flow, we are gaining greater visibility into the future needs of our customers, which will translate into our ability to meet future demand and win projects down the road. Furthermore, we continue to hone our go-to-market efforts in the IT channel area. We saw the greatest traction occur in the United States and the impact got stronger as the year went on.\n Secondly, we are piloting the Vertiv Operating System, known as VOS, in 2 of our manufacturing facilities. Already, we are experiencing improved performance and favorable results as we formalize and standardize the way we work. The rollout globally, as we've said, will take time, but I'm pleased with the early results that we're seeing.\n David talked about margin expansion in his comments, and I'm very pleased with our performance in this area. Our sourcing capabilities have continued to improve. Our pricing initiatives have continued to yield favorable results, and our restructuring actions announced last quarter are now in full flight. The foundation we have established and the trajectory that we are on gives me confidence in our ability to achieve the expansion plans we laid out a year ago.\n Finally, and maybe my personal favorite, VPD, or Vertiv Product Development, progress. We continue to focus and fund our research and development programs. Even though we couldn't -- or had limited travel in 2020 imposed because of COVID, we still conducted the Vertiv User Experience, VUE, sessions to bring us closer to our customers and help us become more stronger strategic partners for the long term. We have seen the pace of new product and service introductions increase year-over-year. And in 2021, there'll be no difference. In addition to these real-time results, we have also started to do some seed planning in a few future targeted areas to ensure we continue to be on the cutting-edge in our industry.\n Now turning to Slide 17. I'm very proud of the Vertiv team and what we've accomplished over the last 12 months. We delivered on our commitments. We demonstrated we are a great company in a growing industry. We have executed on many key activities, which have implemented many strategic -- and implemented many strategic initiatives, which will serve us both well in the short-term and in the long term. To all of our employees on the call today, thank you for the dedication and tireless effort to take care of our customers. To all of our investors, thank you for your support over the past year and being with us on today's call.\n I'll now turn the call over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions. Thank you. Sure. This is Rob. Yes. What I'd say is, we always talk to the fact that we take a look at our pipeline growth, that's always the leading indicator. And even that is pre-activity on quoting, as you mentioned, which is exactly that. We've seen pipeline expand, exiting out of 2020. So that gives us comfort that the enterprise will begin to recover. Activity is intense in the design area with both electrical and mechanical contractors. So again, that gives me a reason to believe that we will see that recovery. It's just a matter of if and when -- not if, but when people do kind of get out of this COVID [ fog ] and start spending again. But the activity looks good and gives me confidence. And then that's globally, it's not -- and we've seen probably a quicker recovery on the enterprise in, let's say, Asia, and Europe is spotty. And then Americas has probably been the lowest. But overall, the pipeline looks good, and the activity is -- we're very active there. Yes. And Nicole, as part of our stated strategy, and we talked about it on the road show, we plan to take R&D up to 6%. Innovation is our vector of differentiation and will allow us to get that margin expansion, and there's a lot of call adjacencies and other the areas that we can participate in. So what we expect, while you've seen a fairly large ramp to catch up to that 6%, we expect 6% of revenue going forward to be in the R&D space so that we can be that innovative leader and look at other adjacencies as well. We expect that, that will produce long-term results over time. R&D does take a little while. Some of our products in the channel space will see benefits within the year. Some of the larger projects we see within 12 to 18 months. But we're very excited about the opportunities that we have more R&D projects, I would say, than we have funding. Our collaboration efforts have proven to be successful with the colo and hyperscale allowing us to design in and drive a better margin profile. Sure. Scott, thanks for the question. Our stated strategy and what we've talked about when we were out raising the pipe was we do have a robust list of potential targets that could be nice bolt-ons for adjacencies or completing a global product line. We'll continue to look at those. And if it makes sense, it hasn't been our first priority. Our first priority was to pay down debt and look at acquisitions as something as opportunistic as they come. And like Dave Cote has always said, they don't always present themselves when we want them to, but we continue to look and follow and track those companies that we might be interested in. But again, it isn't our first priority to go out and buy something. We do like the optionality that we have today, with the strengthening of our liquidity, to be able to look at various things, but we just have to take those as they come. Sure. Amit, it's Rob here. What we've said on these investments is that they -- some -- as I mentioned earlier, some of the projects take a little bit longer than others, but the reason for investing is that we -- so we can outpace the actual market growth. So by investing in these new product categories or new product areas, it will accelerate our growth at 1.5x the market growth rate. \n And those things happen over a period of time, channel-type products, more IT-based products, 6 to 12 months, we began to see a payback on those. And then the larger projects -- products, typically 12 to 18 months and you begin to see the sales on those. And they could be things like a larger UPS -- UPS is larger, megawatt UPSs or larger cooling or thermal management units. So those things take typically a little bit longer to get out globally, but it will yield over the next several years, our ability to outpace the market growth rate. Sure. So we always -- great question. We always kind of combine colo and hyperscale because, as we've talked about in the past, outside the U.S., the hyperscalers typically work with colo, colocation companies, for their data center builds. And inside the U.S., they typically build themselves. And then there's a mixture of that. \n I would say there's room for growth in both. If you just look at our overall market share, we have the ability to grow, and we think our collaboration method and model, working closely with our customers to design those products will give us the ability to take additional share. We had some very nice wins in conversion in 2020 of maybe some colocation companies we haven't worked with in the past. So we think there's plenty of room for growth. And as the expansion happens on a global basis, you'll see that the opportunities there. \n We don't necessarily sell our full entire product set in all of the hyperscalers today. So there's room for improvement there as well, whether it's a larger battery backup system or a larger [ STS ] or more power distribution, there's room for growth there, too. So we're certainly not at a saturation level and have the ability to continue to grow our share there. And that's one of the reasons why we're investing in R&D so heavily. So great question, Lance. This is Rob. What I'd say is it's a combination of both. When we look at the -- some of the share gain that we're seeing, certainly, there's a lot of regional players, smaller regional players that we compete against. And because of our global nature and filling out some product gaps that maybe we had, we're able to take that. \n But I think as it relates to Eaton and Schneider, we compete with them, and it's different in every region, right, how competitive they are or they aren't. But I would say, in general, we're -- we believe we're growing in both cases and taking some share. I know just looking at some of the channel statistics in the IT channel side of things, well, a lot of people were down. I think our overall decline in 2020 was much less than our competitors in some cases, therefore, showing that we took some share there as well. So it's kind of like being in the channel and in the colocation, hyperscale. I'll take a first stab at that and then, David, finish that off. But we will continue to deal as COVID is an issue with site access and -- but we expect that year-over-year, we've got in the plan that we will be growing our services revenue as part of our overall growth strategy. Again, could be to overall COVID, we can't predict what that looks like, but we've been able to navigate pretty well around that. There's just various areas and hotspots that we'll have to deal with from time to time. But we do expect to have and built into our plan is growth in the services for 2021. Yes. I would say it's going to be by industry vertical, right? We're still seeing, of course, travel and entertainment being one that hasn't recovered. I'm not sure when that will recover. Certainly, other verticals like retail, big-box stores, we've seen the spending began there as people continue to compete for that kind of e-tail local distribution. \n Certainly on the financial vertical, we see spending beginning to pick up there in the financial space. And then the other areas of positive signs is around education and government spending would be the other ones that we would see from there. So while some sectors are down. In general, those are kind of the areas that we're seeing some bright spots in today. Mark, I'll start and then I'll let David come in. We're seeing and continue to see strong demand both in Q3 and Q4. If you listen to both hyperscale and colocation, their business is going quite well, and that's a big driver in driving our backlog on projects. I think our global expansion, what we're seeing in China in the telecom side of things. Certainly, India now has come on the radar map to -- for hyperscale and colocation. So I guess what I'd say is we expect upper single-digit growth in the order rates and expect to continue to see that to happen. Yes. Great question, Mark. No, I attribute it to kind of the execution and some of the programs and some of the products that we brought out. We've got some unique products in our power distribution, IT power distribution side. We've been pretty aggressive on our lithium-ion offerings and making sure that that's available. So some of the programs that we've targeted are paying off. And we've had, as we mentioned, quarter-to-quarter -- year-over-year still was down. But quarter-to-quarter, we've seen the improvements. So we feel like we're on the right trajectory with both new product intros, the programs that we're offering, we've certainly simplified our partner portals, project registration being that, hopefully, easier button for our customers to come diverted for that. But we're taking that same, and we've kind of globalized that same strategy to Europe, which is a little bit further behind and then driving it into the rest of Asia and China. So as you know, this is a big part of our strategy. This does take time. We've chosen to do it organically. And -- but we believe that our current strategy and trajectory will yield the results ultimately that we're looking for. Absolutely, Andy. And great catch on the EMEA side of things. What we see typically with hyperscale and colo is typically rushing to various parts of the world. And so there'll be, well, let's say, maybe not as much spending in the U.S. going on or growth. We have seen that in Europe. And I firmly believe the data sovereignty, people want data centers in their country, governments want that data there. They don't want it filling in data centers in the U.S. nor in China. \n So I think there's a lot of build-out. If you take -- just look at the number of data centers, number of cellphone users, number of broadband access in Europe versus what you've got in the U.S., I think we have a lot of runway ahead of ourselves as it relates to Europe and the builds that still have to happen there. \n The Brexit thing has driven lots of data center builds and parts that we didn't think were necessarily going to happen. So we continue to see strength, I think, over the next couple of years in the European side of things. We have taken some share there. We've had some new customers that we haven't traditionally done business with in the past. So the customer acquisition has been good there. But I'll tell you, if you look at globally, I'm pretty excited about, whether it's Europe or Middle East and Africa, South America, again, a lot of chatter and talk in India around colocation, hyperscale finally coming there. They're so underserved.\n So I think we've got a lot of runway in other parts of the world, plus what's still happening here in the U.S. Not that the U.S. isn't going to grow, it's going to continue to grow. But I think we'll see outside, Europe's leading the way now. But I think you'll begin to see some of the Asia countries, and certainly, India begin to pop up on the radar screen as nice area. So all in all, I look at the next several years as we've got a fairly healthy market in front of us. Yes. I'll start off there. And then, David, if you want to come in over the top. I would say, in general, we're probably weighted more towards the telecom side of things in parts of Asia Pac. And that tends to be kind of lower than fleet average margin that we see as we continue to drive innovation and invest in innovation specifically in China, we expect to be able to get paid for that innovation as we go forward. So we're certainly focused on getting that closer to the fleet average. But there is a mix difference as it relates to the types of products we're selling there today. \n So channel is going to be an important part of our success there. And specifically, China, I think, is the driver from a margin perspective as it relates to areas of focus, being more local and driving that local innovation is going to be an important part of what we're doing in 2021 and beyond.\n David, any other thoughts? Thank you, operator, and I'm going to close the call by thanking our 20,000 employees around the world for working hard every day to take care of our customers. We appreciate everyone's time today. Please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you very much for your support."

            "content": "Thanks, Lynne. As I reflect on the past year in Vertiv, I'm even more encouraged that everything we discussed in the road show has been proved to be even more true today. Vertiv has a great position in a good industry and we can differentiate with technology. Sales growth and margin rate expansion opportunity abounds, and we have a team that's making it happen. That opportunity shone brightly in 2020. We were able to hold sales flat and significantly increase orders in a terribly difficult year. We were able to increase our margin rate on flat sales, which is always difficult. And at the same time, we ramped up investment in R&D, other growth drivers, and process initiatives like the Vertiv Operating System, Vertiv Product Development, functional transformation and customer view, the Vertiv User Experience. \n The same is true for 2021. As Vertiv guides to sales growth, margin rate expansion and the reinvestment that drives both in 2022 and beyond. Cash and overall liquidity improved markedly and net leverage is down a lot more than anticipated, especially in a COVID year. My confidence has increased, not decreased over the past year. No matter where I look in Vertiv, we're making great progress. As Timbuk 3 said in their 1986 song, \"The future is so bright, we got to wear shades.\" I felt that way a year ago, and I feel that way even more so today. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. Nicole, this is Dave, just kind of maybe putting the 2 points together. At the end of the day, we're sticking with our strategy to grow sales and hold fixed costs constant. And that creates a lot of room for both margin expansion and reinvestment. So we still plan on doing both, not just in '21, but long into the future."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vertiv Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that the call is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, David Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem.\n Before we begin, I point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.\n We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statements or proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. When we spoke in August, the Vertiv team had wrapped up a very successful second quarter. I'm happy to say the team demonstrated excellent execution again in the third quarter. Vertiv continues to have a great position in a good industry, and I think the proof points of the last several quarters demonstrate that it's not a fluke.\n Even during this COVID time, the data center market remains strong, and Vertiv continues to validate its leadership position in the market. While the team executed on both the top and bottom line over the past several months, they also continue to focus on seed planting. So we'll win not only in the short term but also the long term.\n Initiatives such as the new Vertiv Product Development activities, VPD; deploying the Vertiv User Experience or customer view; and developing their 3-year strategic plan are just some of the ways the Vertiv team is focused on ensuring sustainable success. I am really impressed with the adaptability and the receptiveness of Rob and his team.\n So overall, I'm just as excited today about the future of Vertiv as I was a year ago, and I can't wait to continue working with the team.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Dave. Your ongoing coaching and mentoring has meant a lot to both me and the team. I also want to say thank you to the entire Vertiv team for their efforts in Q3. Despite the challenges of the quarter, one of the positive confidence has been the team's relentless focus on delivering to our customers. A Vertiv's team creativity, energy and passion for serving our customers is always front and center.\n Now let's look at the slides. Turning to Slide 3. Overall, the demand side of the business was very promising. The sales were up 8.5% and orders were up over 15% as compared to Q3 last year. Additionally, this is the fourth quarter in a row where our backlog grows and hit yet another all-time high. We will get a bit more into the specifics on the demand side of the business over the next few slides.\n From a profitability standpoint, our adjusted EBITDA was $179 million, which was up 31% from last year's Q3. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 270 basis points. This was driven by higher sales, higher contribution margin, lower fixed cost on a percentage basis.\n Our free cash flow at the end of Q3 was $129 million, which was $115 million higher than last year's Q3. During our last earnings call, we mentioned that we would be working on a restructuring plan in Q3. We completed that activity and took an $80 million restructuring charge for the programs. These restructuring efforts will drive $85 million of annualized run rate savings by 2023. David will share more details about our plans later in the presentation.\n Next, on this slide, we wanted to provide you some of the ranges for the expected outcome of Q4. We are anticipating the implications of COVID to continue to fluctuate, but based on our current visibility, we expect our organic sales to be up 6% to 8%, and our adjusted EBITDA will be up 18% to 24% from the last quarter, Q4, last year.\n So while these dynamics can change, we did want to share with you what we're currently seeing playing out in Q4. Now all of this is clearly predicted -- predicated on COVID not impacting our customers and not impacting site access any more than what we saw in Q3. We'll discuss more on this topic later.\n Finally, I wanted to add a bit of color around 2021. As we see things right now, the demand side is holding up and our backlog should be robust as we exit the year. On the cost side, we are keeping a close eye on fixed cost constant, but are continually looking at investments in VPDs and other growth programs to ensure long-term success.\n Turning to Slide 4. We used this slide last quarter and received good feedback on it. So we wanted to keep it in for consistency and also add our thoughts around the current market environment. The chart is simple, but it relays the real-time view we have on the demand side of things. It is qualitative in nature and depicts our view on the level of health and activity in each of the markets we serve.\n We continue to see strong levels of activity in every region in the cloud and colocation markets, as indicated by the 6 green buttons in the top 2 rows. Emerging vital applications such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, as a surge in demand is benefiting us as well.\n In contrast, we see the enterprise and small to medium business still being challenged by COVID and indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row 3. This segment spending continues to be mixed. It's probably slightly more positive today than it was 90 days ago, but not significant enough to upgrade any of the regions in this particular space.\n Switching to the telecom side of things. Most of our regions are pretty consistent with prior quarter. We continue to see 5G deployments in U.S. and parts of Asia. While China is certainly deploying 5G, we see a small pause at the moment, as they digest some of their equipment. This is not surprising, and we expect that it will be short-lived.\n Finally, as we've told you before, our C&I business often tracks GDP over the longer run, but sometimes, the quarterly timing can be different. While this segment has held up better than expected, things remain relatively flat. There is certainly some puts and takes, but overall, a decent market picture when you consider our mix of data center business, the applications people use every day to become more and more vital because those applications are needed to be processed, stored, transmitted, and this creates a great backdrop for our business.\n Moving to Slide 5. To reiterate, the overall demand is strong, as evidenced by our order rate and our record backlog, led by EMEA and Asia. EMEA was particularly strong due to some larger projects, specifically in the colocation market.\n As I mentioned in the prior chart, the enterprise and IT channel markets are still not back to pre-COVID levels. But there are signs of life, as evidenced by our integrated rack solutions business having positive growth in the third quarter this year versus the same quarter last year.\n Switching to the supply side now. I'm pleased to report that most of our facilities are operating normally. However, I will say that things continue to evolve very rapidly. We have been very cautious with our workforce as safety is our #1 priority. We continue to navigate through these impacts on the operations and supply chain side, but we have become creative problem solvers and experts in mitigating issues before they become concerns for our customers.\n Gaining access to sites for installation and services has proven to be an issue, but we continue to manage around any restrictions. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines are still struggling with COVID, and we've seen some of these countries in Western Europe tightening back up again.\n These unfortunate COVID-related situations are outside of our control and, however, we continue to work closely with our customers to adhere to health and safety requirements and to make sure that our scheduling of our service departments are as flexible as possible to meet their needs.\n With that, I'll turn it over to David Fallon to walk us through the financials. David? \nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 6. This page summarizes our third quarter financial results versus last year. As you can see, net sales were up $91 million or 8.5%, 8.3% when adjusted for a slight foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders, as Rob mentioned, which were up 15.5% in the third quarter and 10% year-to-date.\n Adjusted EBITDA increased $43 million or 31%, driven by higher sales, improved contribution margin and relatively flat fixed costs, converting into a 270 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin.\n Our sales and profitability performance certainly translated into strong free cash flow of $129 million, which was up $115 million from last year's third quarter.\n We will review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple of slides, but before leaving this page, we are proud to emphasize that our third quarter adjusted EBITDA, related margin and free cash flow figures are all record quarterly highs, demonstrating our continued focus on profitable growth and strong cash flow generation.\n Turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were down $14 million or 3% as growth in our integrated rack solutions segment, primarily in the channel, was more than offset by lower large project sales in our critical infrastructure & solutions segment and lower sales in our services and spares segment caused by COVID site access issues.\n Net sales in APAC increased $56 million or 17%, primarily due to continued strong growth in China across most end markets, including data centers, telecommunications and industrials. Geographic locations outside of China, in APAC, were relatively flat as we continued to deal with some site access challenges in some of those jurisdictions.\n Net sales in EMEA were up $49 million or 24% with $7 million driven by a stronger euro. The $42 million or 21% organic growth, somewhat aided by the timing of large projects was spread across several market verticals, including colocation, data centers, telecommunications and commercial and industrial.\n From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA margin improved in all 3 geographic segments, but notably in the Americas, where margin increased over 800 basis points from last year's third quarter. A portion of this improvement was driven by strong product mix this quarter, but that was coupled with a lower margin large project last year caused by poor internal execution, but the remainder of the increase was the result of higher contribution margin from strong execution of purchasing and pricing initiatives and driving lower fixed costs.\n On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA margin in the Americas has increased over 400 basis points from last year, illustrating the progress we have made with our margin expansion initiatives in a relatively short period of time.\n Next, moving to Slide 8. This chart bridges third quarter free cash flow from last year. The $115 million increase is primarily driven by lower cash interest pursuant to the debt paydown and refinancing in the first quarter, and that is coupled with higher adjusted EBITDA.\n After beginning the year with the use of cash in the first quarter, if you recall, we used about $203 million of free cash flow in Q1. But since then, we have generated more than $190 million of free cash flow over the last 2 quarters, really indicative of the strong cash generation potential of this business. This free cash flow has allowed us to paydown our ABL by $170 million in the third quarter, while improving our liquidity position from about $450 million at the end of the first quarter to over $650 million at the end of September.\n Next, turning to Slide 9. This page summarizes costs and benefits of a restructuring program, which supports our continuing objective to maintain fixed cost constant while reinvesting in the long-term growth of the business.\n Pursuant to this program, we recorded a $71 million restructuring reserve in the third quarter, which was primarily related to severance for head count efficiency and footprint optimization projects to be launched in the fourth quarter and over the next couple of years.\n In addition, we recorded a $9 million intangible asset impairment charge for trademarks and developed technology in a small business unit we are streamlining. We anticipate additional, albeit smaller, restructuring program expenses in both 2021 and 2022 that aren't covered by the third quarter reserve.\n We estimate $84 million net cash outflow to execute the restructuring program with approximately $60 million of that in 2021. We expect $85 million run rate savings from the program in full year 2023, with those gross savings ramping up in each 2021 and 2022.\n For next year, we expect over $40 million gross savings from the restructuring program, offset by approximately $20 million of additional restructuring expenses not covered by the third quarter reserve.\n Next, turning to Slide 10. This page summarizes our financial guidance for the fourth quarter, and overarching any expectations for the next several months is the dynamic uncertainty with COVID, which is certainly worse than in many global jurisdictions. Accordingly, our guidance for next quarter assumes that COVID conditions are not significantly changed from what we experienced in the third quarter. If conditions do become more challenged, our guidance here today could be significantly negatively impacted.\n Notwithstanding these changing COVID conditions, we do expect strong fourth quarter topline growth of 6% to 8% from last year's fourth quarter, and 7% to 9% sequentially from this year's third quarter as we continue to benefit from a record high $1.85 billion backlog at the end of September.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve approximately 165 basis points at the midpoint from last year's fourth quarter as contribution margin should increase from purchasing and pricing initiatives. And fixed costs, although slightly higher than last year, primarily due to growth investment, should decline as a percentage of sales.\n Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin, when looked at sequentially from the third quarter, should be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, despite the anticipated higher sales. And some of the drivers that include the anticipation of an approximately $30 million increase in fixed costs in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as the benefits from our COVID-19 cost savings program ramp down, and in addition to higher growth investment and public company costs.\n Once again, before moving off this slide, we certainly reiterate that these expected fourth quarter results could be significantly negatively impacted by any worsening COVID-19 conditions.\n So with that, I turn it back over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 11, here's a bit more detail regarding our perspective on 2021. We expect cloud, colocation and telecom markets will continue to be healthy as we enter into 2021. Because of COVID, we're unable to anticipate what the enterprise market will look like, but we anticipate growth in the overall data center landscape.\n Our backlog should be slightly better heading into 2021 than we thought at the end of last quarter, which provides us good visibility and confidence on the revenue side for the first half of 2021. However, the uncertainty of COVID provides us a pause today more than we were thinking 90 days ago. Certainly, we're not in the business of making predictions on when there will be a vaccine, but we do see this as a very dynamic situation today, as David mentioned earlier. As we have seen during this entire pandemic, we are planning for the worst scenario and working and hoping for the best as things remain very dynamic even today.\n On the margin side, as we've mentioned previously, we are firm believers in the strategy of holding fixed cost constant. This concept is being practiced today, but as mentioned previously, we will continue to invest in R&D and growth investments that will be key for our long-term success. So while we're not providing specific 2021 guidance at this point, we did want to refresh the commentary we provided to you last quarter.\n Now turning to Slide 12. Our backlog, fixed cost constant approach we have implemented, and our liquidity position are in great shape. We hold a leadership position in a growing industry, and the demand for digital infrastructure to support the vital applications the world needs has never been stronger. We will continue to invest for the future while simultaneously managing for today, so we are prepared to be even more successful as we emerge from this pandemic and the world adapts to a post-COVID life.\n Thank you for being on the call today. Thank you for your support. I'll now turn the call over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rob, thinking about -- just early thoughts about 2021 you gave us, you've mentioned you expect to see strong demand from cloud and colocation, healthy telecom, and then it's too early to call on the enterprise stuff. But it seems like when you put that together with your backlog and you consider the easy comparisons you have, at least in the first half of '21, does it give you at least some confidence that Vertiv could see the type of organic growth you are recording in the second half of '20 lasting into '21, despite the increased COVID risk you're concerned about? \nRob Johnson: I think it's really too early to call what -- again, the recovery on the enterprise, the small to medium business. So I would say that as this business has over the last 4 years, Andy, there is a digestion period and then there is a building period. And we can't really predict what that's going to look like. So I wouldn't be projecting you and saying that we guarantee or we have this same level of growth. But we are seeing a robust market out there, and we're participating, and we're winning our fair share. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then you mentioned the $20 million of incremental benefit in Q3 that came from increased productivity, pricing mix. Maybe you could talk more generally about the progress in implementing the Vertiv operating system. Where are you in the process? How do we think about the incremental opportunity in terms of pricing and productivity as we go into '21? As we go into '21, do the benefits actually accelerate as you continue to improve your focus over the next few quarters? \nRob Johnson: Sure, Andy. Great question. So our Vertiv operating system, and we've talked about this is -- it's something that takes time, right? It's not something that we actually get done in a year or 2 years, but it happens over a period of time as we roll that out and deploy that. And the benefits from some years maybe 50 basis points, next year maybe 100 basis points.\n We feel good about the pilot plants that we have running now and our progress that we've made so far, as it relates to rolling out the Vertiv operating system. And again, we do see long-term benefits from that.\n From a pricing perspective, we continue to get in various parts of the world pricing, and we expect to get pricing again next year as we go into 2021, whether it's on products or services, or our differentiated product sets that we're coming out with. And that's part of the reason why we're investing a lot of money in the -- what we call the Vertiv Product Development, is to bring those features up and have those innovative solutions that customers are willing to pay a better price or give us a better price for that. So we're not just competing on a commodity level product for product. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: And just one more quick one for me. The lower contribution margins that you estimate for Q4 versus Q3, it's really just a function of that $30 million in higher fixed costs and then just continued investment. There is nothing else really to lead into there other than that. \nDavid Fallon: Yes, Andy, this is David. That certainly is a headwind for us in 4Q, the higher fixed cost. We certainly have to point out that we see that higher fixed costs as investment in the long term. A lot of that is driven by VPD spend, R&D spend and continue to invest in some of the growth markets. But we also anticipate contribution margin to dip a little bit in Q4 versus Q3, which is separate from fixed costs, and that's driven in part by product segment mix. So we see healthy growth, Q3, Q4 on the topline, but it's probably a little bit overbalanced to the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, which has a little bit lower margin than the other 2 product segments. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Congratulations on the strong third quarter results. So I'd like to better understand the commentary on the hyperscale market. And of course, as discussed, the company had very good orders in that segment and is expecting some strength to continue there. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that end market in particular? And I asked because some of the semiconductor and technology companies have been seeing a slowdown in data center spend. It doesn't seem like that's Vertiv's outlook. So maybe you could help us understand a little bit more what you're seeing in that market and why Vertiv's business may be a little bit different? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Mark, this is Rob, and thanks for the question. Thanks for being on today. What I'd say is a couple of things. We are seeing strength globally in the colocation and hyperscale market. What tends to happen though is, what you might hear from the chip manufacturers doesn't necessarily correlate or connect directly to the demand that we're seeing, partly because while we're building, they're not filling. And so there is some timing differences as the data centers get built and get deployed from them, then filling with the IT equipment from that perspective. So I don't think we use those as the indicators of where things are going because they're a little bit lagging, what we're seeing on the front end of the business. \nMark Delaney: Got it. That's helpful. And I just wanted to ask on free cash flow, and as we're thinking about 2021 modeling. I know it's still early, but should we think about incremental EBITDA dropping through into incremental free cash flow? Are there any investments in working capital or CapEx we should be cognizant of, just thinking about it at this point? And the company just announced the dividend, but if you could also talk about it, as you are driving that higher free cash flow, how should investors be thinking about the use of that free cash flow? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. So first, on free cash flow. I think a good starting point to understand 2021 is to go back to our beginning of the year guidance for 2020. And this is all pre-COVID, but on a pro forma basis, when you adjust for some of the transaction-related expenses and also adjust for some of the benefit that we started to receive at the end of the first quarter from the debt refinancing and paydown, we had set a pro forma free cash flow for 2020 was in that $285 million to $300 million range. I think that's a really good starting point for next year.\n There certainly will be some moving pieces, and one of those is related to the cash outlay pursuant to the restructuring program, which we said was about $60 million. We should receive some benefit from the lower expenses from the restructuring. I think that's probably a really good starting point.\n As it relates to what we are going to do with the cash, at this point our intention is to paydown debt. \nMark Delaney: That's helpful. If I could just sneak one last follow-up in, around that restructuring. If I recall correctly, at the last quarter's call, the company talked about potential savings of $50 million to $70 million in 2021, and now today, talking about a higher number in 2023. But if I'm understanding correctly, '21 savings is maybe a little bit lower. I don't know, David, if you could -- or anyone on the team could clarify a bit more on how to think about the trajectory of savings from the program? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Great question. So apples-to-apples, the $50 million to $70 million that we discussed at the end of the second quarter after we have completed the initial planning is likely going to be in the $40 million range. So that's a gross savings number. The reason that has declined from when we talked about it 3 months ago is primarily related to some of the planning on the footprint optimization.\n So of course, a -- primary goal of the restructuring is to take costs out, but we have to do that with very minimal impact on our customers. So as we look at the plan, we've moved some of the planning out on some of the footprint projects from mid- to late 2021 into 2022.  And so the savings have not changed. The expected savings have actually increased a little bit, but just the timing has moved out from 2021 into 2022. \nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess, maybe to start with, as I think about the September quarter, growth number is at 8% growth. And I guess, when I think the December quarter, midpoint of growth is [indiscernible] you guys will do 7%, 8% organic growth in the back half of this year. How do I think about that outperformance versus your longer term growth? You've talked about at 3% to 4%. Is that coming more from share gains or better end market? And sort of the durability of that as we go forward? \nRob Johnson: I'll start with that. This is Rob, Amit, and thanks for the question. I think it's a combination of both. The end markets are strong as it relates to colocation, and that was one of our key strategies that we've kind of put in place to take share there, and we've done really well on a global basis. And that end market itself is fairly robust today, and again, driven a lot by COVID and people working from home and just not having enough capacity from that perspective. So I think the overperformance there or a strong performance is really driven by those 2 things. We feel good about our position against the competition. \nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. And I guess, maybe I want to just follow-up on Americas performance, which was down 1% organically versus overall up 8%. If you look at that delta, was that really all attributed to the timing of large projects? Or I guess, maybe how much was that versus some of the other factors? And do you expect to catch up that performance in the December quarter? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David. So I think you hit it right on the head. So the impact of the large project was somewhere between 400 and 500 basis points of growth. So that alone would have turned that negative 2.5% to a positive. But if you also look at the product segment results for the Americas, there also was a headwind for services, which probably contributed about 200 basis points. And in addition, Americas also had a foreign exchange headwind. The other 2 regions had a tailwind in the third quarter, but because of the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, that was about a 1% headwind.\n And looking forward into the fourth quarter, and I think we bullet point this on the guidance slide, we are anticipating low single-digit growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter. So we do anticipate a little bit of a rebound there versus what we saw year-over-year in the third quarter. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: So I just wanted to follow-up on one of the questions asked earlier on the new restructuring program. So I think the $40 million gross savings, get that part. I guess what I'm missing is, I think you guys have talked about, about $60 million of temporary cost benefits in 2020 that you were looking to offset. I guess, is the expectation that, that full $60 million does come back next year, thus creating a net headwind? Or how do we think about that? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Nicole, so -- really good question. So what we would say is, we really have to look at these things independently. So when we look at the restructuring, we do anticipate $40 million of gross savings. We will have additional restructuring expenses of $20 million. So there is a net $20 million savings next year related to restructuring.\n Separately, we do anticipate some headwinds pursuant to the COVID cost-saving program we put in place. If you recall, we anticipated that to be $60 million this year, and we're certainly on track. But of that $60 million, we believe $40 million is going to come back into the business.\n So those 2 things certainly offset, but when you look at all of the savings initiatives and the headwinds, our goal and our target is to keep fixed cost constant. And we purposely -- on the 2021 slide, we provided some indication that we actually anticipate fixed costs to increase in 2021 versus 2020. And a big driver of that is related to the size of the reinvestment back into R&D and growth investment in the market.\n So we kind of look at all these puts and takes fungibly, and when it all boils down to what our fixed costs doing next year, we actually anticipate those to increase a little bit because of that growth investment on a net basis. \nNicole DeBlase: Got it. That's really, really helpful to clarify that. I guess one follow-up. When you guys think about restructuring costs, are you going to add those back to adjusted EBITDA? I'm just trying to think of the right way to model this. \nDavid Fallon: We are not. So going forward, we -- the only item that we will adjust will be for the intangible amortization and that would be reflected in our adjusted EPS, adjusted net income. But going forward, any restructuring expenses will be included in whatever we guide and whatever we report for adjusted EBITDA or whatever -- what other -- whatever financial metric that we'll be reporting. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. I'm just going to squeeze one more in. I guess, back to the point on R&D also related for 2021, any idea yet about the magnitude of R&D growth next year or step-up in investment? Maybe it's too early. And then, I guess, like longer term, does R&D need to continue increasing from here beyond 2021? \nRob Johnson: Nicole, this is Rob. I'll take the first part of that, and Dave can share some guidance or some -- not guidance, but some numbers. We -- part of our strategy, as we stated, was to take our R&D up to around 6%. So we expect that to increase every year as we look at the adjacent, I would call, markets or adjacent product areas and continuing to fill out the product line and driving that innovation in both the Edge and continued in the colo and hyperscale.\n So we look at continued investment as part of -- our vector of differentiation going forward is to continue that development cycle and new products. And we measure that and take a look at revenue from new products and how that helps us grow. So I would expect for the next couple of years as we ramp up to the 6%, and we'll continue to spend at that level, and that will be a key differentiator for us. \nOperator: The next question comes from Lance Vitanza of Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: Congratulations on the quarter. I guess, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the Americas EBITDA margin. Obviously, it is really strong in the quarter, and then even if you were to look over a 9 month -- the last 9 months, it's pretty impressive. I know you mentioned you've got some fixed costs that are coming back in Q4. Should we assume that -- is that sort of the big driver of that big margin improvement? And then is it possible to sort of think about what that margin would have been kind of on a go-forward basis? And just more generally, I guess, do you think about that level of margin as ultimately sustainable or achievable? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Lance. This is David. So first, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress that we're seeing, not only in Americas but in all the regions as it relates to margin expansion, but in particular, in the Americas. Certainly, the 800 basis point improvement versus the third quarter last year was very impressive, but it also improved about 200 basis points from Q2, which is probably more comparable.\n And from our perspective, heading into Q3, the performance that we saw from Americas from an EBITDA margin perspective of around 30%, probably was at the upper range of what we anticipated. And there were a lot of things that went the right way in Q3, including product mix, not necessarily between product segments but within product segments.\n So as we move to the fourth quarter, we would not anticipate to see an EBITDA margin in Americas comparable to Q3. We still would see very nice growth from Q4 last year, but we would anticipate EBITDA margin in Q4 to be more close to Q2. And one of the drivers there for Q4 is that a lot of our growth that we're seeing in Americas and also the other 2 segments is in that critical infrastructure & solutions segment, which does have a little bit lower margin than the other 2 segments.\n So we're very hopeful that, that contribution margin and the EBITDA margin we saw in Americas is -- really portends what's to come for that segment and the business in general. But just looking out one quarter, we would anticipate that to drop back a little bit. \nLance Vitanza: That's helpful. If I could just get one more in, a quick one. You mentioned in the slides that the definition of -- your free cash flow definition includes dispositions of PP&E. I don't think that, that was material in Q3. Do you expect that, that will be material going forward at any point? \nDavid Fallon: Certainly not this year. I think we had about $5 million last year. I'm not sure we've had anything year-to-date. So we wouldn't anticipate anything significant for Q3 -- I'm sorry, for Q4. However, related to the restructuring program, we do plan to sell facilities, some equipment and that probably would be timed in 2022. It could slip into the end of 2021, but we wouldn't anticipate anything for at least -- significant -- anything significant for at least a year. \nLance Vitanza: Have those prospective potential inflows been kind of netted against the numbers that we're talking about in terms of your spend over the course of the next year? \nDavid Fallon: It is. So when we -- well, for the lifetime of the program, we're expecting $84 million net cash outflow to support the savings. The anticipated sale of assets is net in that number, and it's somewhere between $20 million and $25 million. So the gross cash outflow is over $100 million, but we do anticipate to get between $20 million and $25 million for these asset sales. And once again, most of that we anticipate to come in 2022. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: I think a lot of my questions have been answered, but just one question just to clarify. So if fixed costs are going to be increasing in '21 versus 2020, so should we think about incremental EBITDA margins coming in below gross margins, so target contribution margin, 40%, 45%, but maybe thinking low to mid-30s contribution, is that still reasonable? \nDavid Fallon: So I think from a contribution margin perspective, what we have spoken to was a general range between 40% and 45%. It depends on the region. It depends on customer mix and market vertical mix, but we still generally plan internally for that range, and that's what we would speak to externally.\n What I will say from a fixed cost perspective, and I want to caveat all this, again, we are not providing guidance for 2021 yet. We are still going through the planning process ourselves, but we felt it prudent to provide some expectations that we see a lot of good R&D and VPD projects for next year, quite frankly, more projects, and we have resources to complete. And we thought it was prudent to continue to invest in those. And as a result, because of the size of that investment, we anticipate fixed cost to increase.\n But from a margin perspective, we would not believe that to be a tailwind. So from an impact on margin, we don't believe fixed cost is going to increase as a percentage as high as the topline will increase year-over-year. So even though fixed cost will increase, we don't think that would be a significant headwind as it relates to EBITDA margins. \nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just another question, just to clarify on enterprise versus sort of small and medium business. I think one of your competitors commented actually that they were somewhat more bullish on enterprise outlook, both near term and medium term. And I just want to parcel out, you did talk about sort of big project slippage. Was that on the enterprise side or was that sort of on the colo, cloud side? Just want to understand -- just, yes. So that's a good question. And maybe then just a little bit more color on what's happening in small and medium business side of things. \nRob Johnson: Yes, sure. This is Rob. A couple of things. The large projects are colo and hyperscale. So that kind of covers that area. On the enterprise side, what we look at as we really go to this hybrid world of on-prem and cloud, they might be referring to some of the Edge strength that we are seeing in some of the enterprise. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of activity in the enterprise from an engineering perspective. And so when we say, we're not -- enterprise still hasn't recovered, they're just not pulling the trigger. But there is certainly a lot of activity out there that we have visibility to of projects that we'll break at some point in time.\n From the small to medium business, we did see a little bit of growth in the, what we call, our IRS business, which is driven by the channel side of things. So we're really happy with the execution that we're doing there, but we just haven't seen -- and if you see some of the numbers out with CDW and so forth, people are still experiencing negative growth, but beginning to see potential light at the end of the tunnel.\n That being said, if COVID continues to persist, I think that affects that particular area as we go forward. Our plan there, as a company, was to take share in the channel and grow, and I think that's how we were able to kind of, I would say, outperform what most of the companies are doing as it relates to channel by taking share with innovative new products. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question will come from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: I wanted to pick up on the enterprise question from Andrew to explore that. Obviously, when we see reds and yellows, it raises the question of physical versus structural kinds of pressures. And I'm just curious, do you think with the current market -- it sounds like you've seen some good activity, and it sounds like you're sort of encouraged by that.\n Do you think that there's been any change in the sort of the balance between on-prem and colo, but with cloud for the enterprise segment? And would you expect -- 2021, obviously, still very much [ up in the air ], but do you think there is a shot that enterprise can come back next year? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Nigel, thanks for the question. What we'd say is, yes, we have been seeing some life. When I say life, we've been seeing a lot of activity in the enterprise side of things, which would indicate at some point in time when they pull the trigger that things will move forward. We haven't really seen a drastic move one way or the other to the cloud or on-prem.\n I mean certainly, things like Teams and Zoom and BlueJeans and things like that are driving a lot of internet traffic, which is driving the need for more demand and bandwidth and latency from that perspective. But we continue to see the enterprise looks at various applications and those ones that are readily and easily moved to the cloud, they do, and still seeing the advent of on-prem and the Edge data centers.\n The other phenomenon that we've talked about in the past is really this data kind of staying within the country or within the region. So we're seeing a lot of builds in Europe and other parts of the world for people basically keeping that data, certain sets of data within their region, within their country, that type of thing.\n So we'll continue to see those types of builds as well. But I think what we're all waiting for and looking to is, once there is a vaccine, whenever that might be, and enterprise gets back and we have a kind of a new way of, I would call it, even a hybrid working from home and working from the office, we'll drive those projects and begin to move those off data center. \nNigel Coe: Great. That's helpful. And then I wanted to talk about the announcement with Honeywell that was announced early this -- in October. They had it in their slides, and I don't think you've got it in your slides. I think it's interesting. But how do you view this strategically? What is this -- kind of what problem does it solve for Vertiv? And how do you see this progressing? And kind of -- I think strategically, the question is, how does this help you and strengthen you going forward? \nRob Johnson: Yes. So we're actually really excited about it. So not having it in our slides, there is no indication of our excitement of working with them. We see Honeywell and Vertiv one-on-one kind of makes 3 for the customers. Honeywell is very strong in the software and the management side of the data centers and really driving efficiency and algorithms around performance of equipment.\n And our announcement that we talked about the first product that we're working together on is really about using multiple sources in kind of a microgrid fashion for data center. So we select whether it's solar or whether it's used fuel cells or pull off the grid, and we see this just as the beginning of some of the collaboration and good things that we believe we can do together.\n So I think when you put Vertiv and Honeywell together, both with our global footprint, we can offer the customers and take advantage of a lot of the really good software that Honeywell has and management systems coupled with our equipment and get better performance and help people reach their PUEs and reach out of their carbon footprint as well. \nNigel Coe: And would this be more in the hyperscale and colo segments? Or do you see that's much broader than that? \nRob Johnson: I think it's much broader than that. I think it scales from hyperscale, colo, enterprise and certainly, down to the Edge. As the Edge increases with thousands and millions of devices, Honeywell has got a really good strong portfolio of software for managing those, and tying that in with our product intelligence can allow us to smartly begin to do more of that predictive failure analysis, roll trucks when we need to. So again, I think it really spans both Edge, and cloud and colo. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks. \nRob Johnson: Thank you, operator. I'm going to close the call by thanking our 19,000-plus employees around the world, who're working very hard every day to take care of our customers during this unprecedented time. We appreciate everybody's time today. We appreciate your support. Please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking you -- to you again soon. Thank you very much. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 6. This page summarizes our third quarter financial results versus last year. As you can see, net sales were up $91 million or 8.5%, 8.3% when adjusted for a slight foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders, as Rob mentioned, which were up 15.5% in the third quarter and 10% year-to-date.\n Adjusted EBITDA increased $43 million or 31%, driven by higher sales, improved contribution margin and relatively flat fixed costs, converting into a 270 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin.\n Our sales and profitability performance certainly translated into strong free cash flow of $129 million, which was up $115 million from last year's third quarter.\n We will review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple of slides, but before leaving this page, we are proud to emphasize that our third quarter adjusted EBITDA, related margin and free cash flow figures are all record quarterly highs, demonstrating our continued focus on profitable growth and strong cash flow generation.\n Turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were down $14 million or 3% as growth in our integrated rack solutions segment, primarily in the channel, was more than offset by lower large project sales in our critical infrastructure & solutions segment and lower sales in our services and spares segment caused by COVID site access issues.\n Net sales in APAC increased $56 million or 17%, primarily due to continued strong growth in China across most end markets, including data centers, telecommunications and industrials. Geographic locations outside of China, in APAC, were relatively flat as we continued to deal with some site access challenges in some of those jurisdictions.\n Net sales in EMEA were up $49 million or 24% with $7 million driven by a stronger euro. The $42 million or 21% organic growth, somewhat aided by the timing of large projects was spread across several market verticals, including colocation, data centers, telecommunications and commercial and industrial.\n From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA margin improved in all 3 geographic segments, but notably in the Americas, where margin increased over 800 basis points from last year's third quarter. A portion of this improvement was driven by strong product mix this quarter, but that was coupled with a lower margin large project last year caused by poor internal execution, but the remainder of the increase was the result of higher contribution margin from strong execution of purchasing and pricing initiatives and driving lower fixed costs.\n On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA margin in the Americas has increased over 400 basis points from last year, illustrating the progress we have made with our margin expansion initiatives in a relatively short period of time.\n Next, moving to Slide 8. This chart bridges third quarter free cash flow from last year. The $115 million increase is primarily driven by lower cash interest pursuant to the debt paydown and refinancing in the first quarter, and that is coupled with higher adjusted EBITDA.\n After beginning the year with the use of cash in the first quarter, if you recall, we used about $203 million of free cash flow in Q1. But since then, we have generated more than $190 million of free cash flow over the last 2 quarters, really indicative of the strong cash generation potential of this business. This free cash flow has allowed us to paydown our ABL by $170 million in the third quarter, while improving our liquidity position from about $450 million at the end of the first quarter to over $650 million at the end of September.\n Next, turning to Slide 9. This page summarizes costs and benefits of a restructuring program, which supports our continuing objective to maintain fixed cost constant while reinvesting in the long-term growth of the business.\n Pursuant to this program, we recorded a $71 million restructuring reserve in the third quarter, which was primarily related to severance for head count efficiency and footprint optimization projects to be launched in the fourth quarter and over the next couple of years.\n In addition, we recorded a $9 million intangible asset impairment charge for trademarks and developed technology in a small business unit we are streamlining. We anticipate additional, albeit smaller, restructuring program expenses in both 2021 and 2022 that aren't covered by the third quarter reserve.\n We estimate $84 million net cash outflow to execute the restructuring program with approximately $60 million of that in 2021. We expect $85 million run rate savings from the program in full year 2023, with those gross savings ramping up in each 2021 and 2022.\n For next year, we expect over $40 million gross savings from the restructuring program, offset by approximately $20 million of additional restructuring expenses not covered by the third quarter reserve.\n Next, turning to Slide 10. This page summarizes our financial guidance for the fourth quarter, and overarching any expectations for the next several months is the dynamic uncertainty with COVID, which is certainly worse than in many global jurisdictions. Accordingly, our guidance for next quarter assumes that COVID conditions are not significantly changed from what we experienced in the third quarter. If conditions do become more challenged, our guidance here today could be significantly negatively impacted.\n Notwithstanding these changing COVID conditions, we do expect strong fourth quarter topline growth of 6% to 8% from last year's fourth quarter, and 7% to 9% sequentially from this year's third quarter as we continue to benefit from a record high $1.85 billion backlog at the end of September.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to improve approximately 165 basis points at the midpoint from last year's fourth quarter as contribution margin should increase from purchasing and pricing initiatives. And fixed costs, although slightly higher than last year, primarily due to growth investment, should decline as a percentage of sales.\n Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin, when looked at sequentially from the third quarter, should be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, despite the anticipated higher sales. And some of the drivers that include the anticipation of an approximately $30 million increase in fixed costs in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as the benefits from our COVID-19 cost savings program ramp down, and in addition to higher growth investment and public company costs.\n Once again, before moving off this slide, we certainly reiterate that these expected fourth quarter results could be significantly negatively impacted by any worsening COVID-19 conditions.\n So with that, I turn it back over to Rob. Yes, Andy, this is David. That certainly is a headwind for us in 4Q, the higher fixed cost. We certainly have to point out that we see that higher fixed costs as investment in the long term. A lot of that is driven by VPD spend, R&D spend and continue to invest in some of the growth markets. But we also anticipate contribution margin to dip a little bit in Q4 versus Q3, which is separate from fixed costs, and that's driven in part by product segment mix. So we see healthy growth, Q3, Q4 on the topline, but it's probably a little bit overbalanced to the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, which has a little bit lower margin than the other 2 product segments. Yes. Thanks for the question, Mark. So first, on free cash flow. I think a good starting point to understand 2021 is to go back to our beginning of the year guidance for 2020. And this is all pre-COVID, but on a pro forma basis, when you adjust for some of the transaction-related expenses and also adjust for some of the benefit that we started to receive at the end of the first quarter from the debt refinancing and paydown, we had set a pro forma free cash flow for 2020 was in that $285 million to $300 million range. I think that's a really good starting point for next year.\n There certainly will be some moving pieces, and one of those is related to the cash outlay pursuant to the restructuring program, which we said was about $60 million. We should receive some benefit from the lower expenses from the restructuring. I think that's probably a really good starting point.\n As it relates to what we are going to do with the cash, at this point our intention is to paydown debt. Yes. Great question. So apples-to-apples, the $50 million to $70 million that we discussed at the end of the second quarter after we have completed the initial planning is likely going to be in the $40 million range. So that's a gross savings number. The reason that has declined from when we talked about it 3 months ago is primarily related to some of the planning on the footprint optimization.\n So of course, a -- primary goal of the restructuring is to take costs out, but we have to do that with very minimal impact on our customers. So as we look at the plan, we've moved some of the planning out on some of the footprint projects from mid- to late 2021 into 2022.  And so the savings have not changed. The expected savings have actually increased a little bit, but just the timing has moved out from 2021 into 2022. Yes. This is David. So I think you hit it right on the head. So the impact of the large project was somewhere between 400 and 500 basis points of growth. So that alone would have turned that negative 2.5% to a positive. But if you also look at the product segment results for the Americas, there also was a headwind for services, which probably contributed about 200 basis points. And in addition, Americas also had a foreign exchange headwind. The other 2 regions had a tailwind in the third quarter, but because of the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real, that was about a 1% headwind.\n And looking forward into the fourth quarter, and I think we bullet point this on the guidance slide, we are anticipating low single-digit growth in the Americas in the fourth quarter. So we do anticipate a little bit of a rebound there versus what we saw year-over-year in the third quarter. Yes. Nicole, so -- really good question. So what we would say is, we really have to look at these things independently. So when we look at the restructuring, we do anticipate $40 million of gross savings. We will have additional restructuring expenses of $20 million. So there is a net $20 million savings next year related to restructuring.\n Separately, we do anticipate some headwinds pursuant to the COVID cost-saving program we put in place. If you recall, we anticipated that to be $60 million this year, and we're certainly on track. But of that $60 million, we believe $40 million is going to come back into the business.\n So those 2 things certainly offset, but when you look at all of the savings initiatives and the headwinds, our goal and our target is to keep fixed cost constant. And we purposely -- on the 2021 slide, we provided some indication that we actually anticipate fixed costs to increase in 2021 versus 2020. And a big driver of that is related to the size of the reinvestment back into R&D and growth investment in the market.\n So we kind of look at all these puts and takes fungibly, and when it all boils down to what our fixed costs doing next year, we actually anticipate those to increase a little bit because of that growth investment on a net basis. We are not. So going forward, we -- the only item that we will adjust will be for the intangible amortization and that would be reflected in our adjusted EPS, adjusted net income. But going forward, any restructuring expenses will be included in whatever we guide and whatever we report for adjusted EBITDA or whatever -- what other -- whatever financial metric that we'll be reporting. Yes. Thanks, Lance. This is David. So first, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the progress that we're seeing, not only in Americas but in all the regions as it relates to margin expansion, but in particular, in the Americas. Certainly, the 800 basis point improvement versus the third quarter last year was very impressive, but it also improved about 200 basis points from Q2, which is probably more comparable.\n And from our perspective, heading into Q3, the performance that we saw from Americas from an EBITDA margin perspective of around 30%, probably was at the upper range of what we anticipated. And there were a lot of things that went the right way in Q3, including product mix, not necessarily between product segments but within product segments.\n So as we move to the fourth quarter, we would not anticipate to see an EBITDA margin in Americas comparable to Q3. We still would see very nice growth from Q4 last year, but we would anticipate EBITDA margin in Q4 to be more close to Q2. And one of the drivers there for Q4 is that a lot of our growth that we're seeing in Americas and also the other 2 segments is in that critical infrastructure & solutions segment, which does have a little bit lower margin than the other 2 segments.\n So we're very hopeful that, that contribution margin and the EBITDA margin we saw in Americas is -- really portends what's to come for that segment and the business in general. But just looking out one quarter, we would anticipate that to drop back a little bit. Certainly not this year. I think we had about $5 million last year. I'm not sure we've had anything year-to-date. So we wouldn't anticipate anything significant for Q3 -- I'm sorry, for Q4. However, related to the restructuring program, we do plan to sell facilities, some equipment and that probably would be timed in 2022. It could slip into the end of 2021, but we wouldn't anticipate anything for at least -- significant -- anything significant for at least a year. It is. So when we -- well, for the lifetime of the program, we're expecting $84 million net cash outflow to support the savings. The anticipated sale of assets is net in that number, and it's somewhere between $20 million and $25 million. So the gross cash outflow is over $100 million, but we do anticipate to get between $20 million and $25 million for these asset sales. And once again, most of that we anticipate to come in 2022. So I think from a contribution margin perspective, what we have spoken to was a general range between 40% and 45%. It depends on the region. It depends on customer mix and market vertical mix, but we still generally plan internally for that range, and that's what we would speak to externally.\n What I will say from a fixed cost perspective, and I want to caveat all this, again, we are not providing guidance for 2021 yet. We are still going through the planning process ourselves, but we felt it prudent to provide some expectations that we see a lot of good R&D and VPD projects for next year, quite frankly, more projects, and we have resources to complete. And we thought it was prudent to continue to invest in those. And as a result, because of the size of that investment, we anticipate fixed cost to increase.\n But from a margin perspective, we would not believe that to be a tailwind. So from an impact on margin, we don't believe fixed cost is going to increase as a percentage as high as the topline will increase year-over-year. So even though fixed cost will increase, we don't think that would be a significant headwind as it relates to EBITDA margins."

            "name": "Rob Johnson",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Dave. Your ongoing coaching and mentoring has meant a lot to both me and the team. I also want to say thank you to the entire Vertiv team for their efforts in Q3. Despite the challenges of the quarter, one of the positive confidence has been the team's relentless focus on delivering to our customers. A Vertiv's team creativity, energy and passion for serving our customers is always front and center.\n Now let's look at the slides. Turning to Slide 3. Overall, the demand side of the business was very promising. The sales were up 8.5% and orders were up over 15% as compared to Q3 last year. Additionally, this is the fourth quarter in a row where our backlog grows and hit yet another all-time high. We will get a bit more into the specifics on the demand side of the business over the next few slides.\n From a profitability standpoint, our adjusted EBITDA was $179 million, which was up 31% from last year's Q3. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 270 basis points. This was driven by higher sales, higher contribution margin, lower fixed cost on a percentage basis.\n Our free cash flow at the end of Q3 was $129 million, which was $115 million higher than last year's Q3. During our last earnings call, we mentioned that we would be working on a restructuring plan in Q3. We completed that activity and took an $80 million restructuring charge for the programs. These restructuring efforts will drive $85 million of annualized run rate savings by 2023. David will share more details about our plans later in the presentation.\n Next, on this slide, we wanted to provide you some of the ranges for the expected outcome of Q4. We are anticipating the implications of COVID to continue to fluctuate, but based on our current visibility, we expect our organic sales to be up 6% to 8%, and our adjusted EBITDA will be up 18% to 24% from the last quarter, Q4, last year.\n So while these dynamics can change, we did want to share with you what we're currently seeing playing out in Q4. Now all of this is clearly predicted -- predicated on COVID not impacting our customers and not impacting site access any more than what we saw in Q3. We'll discuss more on this topic later.\n Finally, I wanted to add a bit of color around 2021. As we see things right now, the demand side is holding up and our backlog should be robust as we exit the year. On the cost side, we are keeping a close eye on fixed cost constant, but are continually looking at investments in VPDs and other growth programs to ensure long-term success.\n Turning to Slide 4. We used this slide last quarter and received good feedback on it. So we wanted to keep it in for consistency and also add our thoughts around the current market environment. The chart is simple, but it relays the real-time view we have on the demand side of things. It is qualitative in nature and depicts our view on the level of health and activity in each of the markets we serve.\n We continue to see strong levels of activity in every region in the cloud and colocation markets, as indicated by the 6 green buttons in the top 2 rows. Emerging vital applications such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, as a surge in demand is benefiting us as well.\n In contrast, we see the enterprise and small to medium business still being challenged by COVID and indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row 3. This segment spending continues to be mixed. It's probably slightly more positive today than it was 90 days ago, but not significant enough to upgrade any of the regions in this particular space.\n Switching to the telecom side of things. Most of our regions are pretty consistent with prior quarter. We continue to see 5G deployments in U.S. and parts of Asia. While China is certainly deploying 5G, we see a small pause at the moment, as they digest some of their equipment. This is not surprising, and we expect that it will be short-lived.\n Finally, as we've told you before, our C&I business often tracks GDP over the longer run, but sometimes, the quarterly timing can be different. While this segment has held up better than expected, things remain relatively flat. There is certainly some puts and takes, but overall, a decent market picture when you consider our mix of data center business, the applications people use every day to become more and more vital because those applications are needed to be processed, stored, transmitted, and this creates a great backdrop for our business.\n Moving to Slide 5. To reiterate, the overall demand is strong, as evidenced by our order rate and our record backlog, led by EMEA and Asia. EMEA was particularly strong due to some larger projects, specifically in the colocation market.\n As I mentioned in the prior chart, the enterprise and IT channel markets are still not back to pre-COVID levels. But there are signs of life, as evidenced by our integrated rack solutions business having positive growth in the third quarter this year versus the same quarter last year.\n Switching to the supply side now. I'm pleased to report that most of our facilities are operating normally. However, I will say that things continue to evolve very rapidly. We have been very cautious with our workforce as safety is our #1 priority. We continue to navigate through these impacts on the operations and supply chain side, but we have become creative problem solvers and experts in mitigating issues before they become concerns for our customers.\n Gaining access to sites for installation and services has proven to be an issue, but we continue to manage around any restrictions. Countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines are still struggling with COVID, and we've seen some of these countries in Western Europe tightening back up again.\n These unfortunate COVID-related situations are outside of our control and, however, we continue to work closely with our customers to adhere to health and safety requirements and to make sure that our scheduling of our service departments are as flexible as possible to meet their needs.\n With that, I'll turn it over to David Fallon to walk us through the financials. David? Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 11, here's a bit more detail regarding our perspective on 2021. We expect cloud, colocation and telecom markets will continue to be healthy as we enter into 2021. Because of COVID, we're unable to anticipate what the enterprise market will look like, but we anticipate growth in the overall data center landscape.\n Our backlog should be slightly better heading into 2021 than we thought at the end of last quarter, which provides us good visibility and confidence on the revenue side for the first half of 2021. However, the uncertainty of COVID provides us a pause today more than we were thinking 90 days ago. Certainly, we're not in the business of making predictions on when there will be a vaccine, but we do see this as a very dynamic situation today, as David mentioned earlier. As we have seen during this entire pandemic, we are planning for the worst scenario and working and hoping for the best as things remain very dynamic even today.\n On the margin side, as we've mentioned previously, we are firm believers in the strategy of holding fixed cost constant. This concept is being practiced today, but as mentioned previously, we will continue to invest in R&D and growth investments that will be key for our long-term success. So while we're not providing specific 2021 guidance at this point, we did want to refresh the commentary we provided to you last quarter.\n Now turning to Slide 12. Our backlog, fixed cost constant approach we have implemented, and our liquidity position are in great shape. We hold a leadership position in a growing industry, and the demand for digital infrastructure to support the vital applications the world needs has never been stronger. We will continue to invest for the future while simultaneously managing for today, so we are prepared to be even more successful as we emerge from this pandemic and the world adapts to a post-COVID life.\n Thank you for being on the call today. Thank you for your support. I'll now turn the call over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions. I think it's really too early to call what -- again, the recovery on the enterprise, the small to medium business. So I would say that as this business has over the last 4 years, Andy, there is a digestion period and then there is a building period. And we can't really predict what that's going to look like. So I wouldn't be projecting you and saying that we guarantee or we have this same level of growth. But we are seeing a robust market out there, and we're participating, and we're winning our fair share. Sure, Andy. Great question. So our Vertiv operating system, and we've talked about this is -- it's something that takes time, right? It's not something that we actually get done in a year or 2 years, but it happens over a period of time as we roll that out and deploy that. And the benefits from some years maybe 50 basis points, next year maybe 100 basis points.\n We feel good about the pilot plants that we have running now and our progress that we've made so far, as it relates to rolling out the Vertiv operating system. And again, we do see long-term benefits from that.\n From a pricing perspective, we continue to get in various parts of the world pricing, and we expect to get pricing again next year as we go into 2021, whether it's on products or services, or our differentiated product sets that we're coming out with. And that's part of the reason why we're investing a lot of money in the -- what we call the Vertiv Product Development, is to bring those features up and have those innovative solutions that customers are willing to pay a better price or give us a better price for that. So we're not just competing on a commodity level product for product. Yes. Mark, this is Rob, and thanks for the question. Thanks for being on today. What I'd say is a couple of things. We are seeing strength globally in the colocation and hyperscale market. What tends to happen though is, what you might hear from the chip manufacturers doesn't necessarily correlate or connect directly to the demand that we're seeing, partly because while we're building, they're not filling. And so there is some timing differences as the data centers get built and get deployed from them, then filling with the IT equipment from that perspective. So I don't think we use those as the indicators of where things are going because they're a little bit lagging, what we're seeing on the front end of the business. I'll start with that. This is Rob, Amit, and thanks for the question. I think it's a combination of both. The end markets are strong as it relates to colocation, and that was one of our key strategies that we've kind of put in place to take share there, and we've done really well on a global basis. And that end market itself is fairly robust today, and again, driven a lot by COVID and people working from home and just not having enough capacity from that perspective. So I think the overperformance there or a strong performance is really driven by those 2 things. We feel good about our position against the competition. Nicole, this is Rob. I'll take the first part of that, and Dave can share some guidance or some -- not guidance, but some numbers. We -- part of our strategy, as we stated, was to take our R&D up to around 6%. So we expect that to increase every year as we look at the adjacent, I would call, markets or adjacent product areas and continuing to fill out the product line and driving that innovation in both the Edge and continued in the colo and hyperscale.\n So we look at continued investment as part of -- our vector of differentiation going forward is to continue that development cycle and new products. And we measure that and take a look at revenue from new products and how that helps us grow. So I would expect for the next couple of years as we ramp up to the 6%, and we'll continue to spend at that level, and that will be a key differentiator for us. Yes, sure. This is Rob. A couple of things. The large projects are colo and hyperscale. So that kind of covers that area. On the enterprise side, what we look at as we really go to this hybrid world of on-prem and cloud, they might be referring to some of the Edge strength that we are seeing in some of the enterprise. Certainly, we're seeing a lot of activity in the enterprise from an engineering perspective. And so when we say, we're not -- enterprise still hasn't recovered, they're just not pulling the trigger. But there is certainly a lot of activity out there that we have visibility to of projects that we'll break at some point in time.\n From the small to medium business, we did see a little bit of growth in the, what we call, our IRS business, which is driven by the channel side of things. So we're really happy with the execution that we're doing there, but we just haven't seen -- and if you see some of the numbers out with CDW and so forth, people are still experiencing negative growth, but beginning to see potential light at the end of the tunnel.\n That being said, if COVID continues to persist, I think that affects that particular area as we go forward. Our plan there, as a company, was to take share in the channel and grow, and I think that's how we were able to kind of, I would say, outperform what most of the companies are doing as it relates to channel by taking share with innovative new products. Yes. Nigel, thanks for the question. What we'd say is, yes, we have been seeing some life. When I say life, we've been seeing a lot of activity in the enterprise side of things, which would indicate at some point in time when they pull the trigger that things will move forward. We haven't really seen a drastic move one way or the other to the cloud or on-prem.\n I mean certainly, things like Teams and Zoom and BlueJeans and things like that are driving a lot of internet traffic, which is driving the need for more demand and bandwidth and latency from that perspective. But we continue to see the enterprise looks at various applications and those ones that are readily and easily moved to the cloud, they do, and still seeing the advent of on-prem and the Edge data centers.\n The other phenomenon that we've talked about in the past is really this data kind of staying within the country or within the region. So we're seeing a lot of builds in Europe and other parts of the world for people basically keeping that data, certain sets of data within their region, within their country, that type of thing.\n So we'll continue to see those types of builds as well. But I think what we're all waiting for and looking to is, once there is a vaccine, whenever that might be, and enterprise gets back and we have a kind of a new way of, I would call it, even a hybrid working from home and working from the office, we'll drive those projects and begin to move those off data center. Yes. So we're actually really excited about it. So not having it in our slides, there is no indication of our excitement of working with them. We see Honeywell and Vertiv one-on-one kind of makes 3 for the customers. Honeywell is very strong in the software and the management side of the data centers and really driving efficiency and algorithms around performance of equipment.\n And our announcement that we talked about the first product that we're working together on is really about using multiple sources in kind of a microgrid fashion for data center. So we select whether it's solar or whether it's used fuel cells or pull off the grid, and we see this just as the beginning of some of the collaboration and good things that we believe we can do together.\n So I think when you put Vertiv and Honeywell together, both with our global footprint, we can offer the customers and take advantage of a lot of the really good software that Honeywell has and management systems coupled with our equipment and get better performance and help people reach their PUEs and reach out of their carbon footprint as well. I think it's much broader than that. I think it scales from hyperscale, colo, enterprise and certainly, down to the Edge. As the Edge increases with thousands and millions of devices, Honeywell has got a really good strong portfolio of software for managing those, and tying that in with our product intelligence can allow us to smartly begin to do more of that predictive failure analysis, roll trucks when we need to. So again, I think it really spans both Edge, and cloud and colo. Thank you, operator. I'm going to close the call by thanking our 19,000-plus employees around the world, who're working very hard every day to take care of our customers during this unprecedented time. We appreciate everybody's time today. We appreciate your support. Please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking you -- to you again soon. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. When we spoke in August, the Vertiv team had wrapped up a very successful second quarter. I'm happy to say the team demonstrated excellent execution again in the third quarter. Vertiv continues to have a great position in a good industry, and I think the proof points of the last several quarters demonstrate that it's not a fluke.\n Even during this COVID time, the data center market remains strong, and Vertiv continues to validate its leadership position in the market. While the team executed on both the top and bottom line over the past several months, they also continue to focus on seed planting. So we'll win not only in the short term but also the long term.\n Initiatives such as the new Vertiv Product Development activities, VPD; deploying the Vertiv User Experience or customer view; and developing their 3-year strategic plan are just some of the ways the Vertiv team is focused on ensuring sustainable success. I am really impressed with the adaptability and the receptiveness of Rob and his team.\n So overall, I'm just as excited today about the future of Vertiv as I was a year ago, and I can't wait to continue working with the team.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, David Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem. Before we begin, I'd point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events including the future financial and operation -- operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. [We refer you to the] cautionary language included in today's earnings release and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement, our proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements made today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, David Cote.\nDavid Cote: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. When the last time we spoke in early May, everyone was still trying to determine what the implications of COVID were going to be and exactly what type of recession we were going to have. Well, today, 3 months later, while some things are more clear, there are also many things that are still not clear. What is clear, however, is how Vertiv is executing during this time. As many of you know, one of my mantras in business is growing while holding fixed costs constant. And while that's easy in theory, it's not so easy in practice. What I can tell you is that both Rob and Dave Fallon have fully embraced the concept and are deploying it within Vertiv in an aggressive manner. One of my other beliefs is achieving 2 seemingly conflicting objectives at the same time. Where this seems difficult, it is, in fact, very doable. Inside of Vertiv, we're employing the same mindset by managing our costs very closely, but at the same time, we've been ramping up R&D spending so we continue innovating for our customers today and tomorrow. We're also working on strategy development. Just a few week ago, Rob's team went through a week-long strategy review that I participated in for its entirety. Don't worry, it was all remote. There is absolutely no shortage of ideas on how to grow our top and bottom line. Now there's a lot of work to do to bring this to life, but it sure was a great starting point for the company. We can't know for sure the economic environment globally over the next several months, but I am very confident in our ability to navigate these waters and come out the other side a significantly better company. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Johnson: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the slide, I want to tell you about how proud I am of the Vertiv team. Serving customers during the pandemic has not been without its challenges. Employees across the company and located in countries across the globe have addressed issues of all kinds brought on by COVID. And they've done it creatively, they've done it energetically and they've done it passionately. I couldn't ask for a better team, and I'm truly grateful to them and for how they have always put the customer first. Let's get into the slides. On Slide 4, overall, the demand side of our business held up as orders were up 5% organically from Q2 2019. Last quarter, we talked about exiting with an all-time high backlog of $1.6 billion. And now I'm proud and happy to report that our backlog is even greater than that at about approximately $1.8 billion. We will talk over the next few slides about both the supply and the demand side of our business. From a profitability standpoint, we delivered $145 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is relatively flat from last year's Q2. Although Q2 had $128 million lower sales than Q2 of 2019, we managed our contribution margins very well and held our cost in line, as Dave Cote mentioned in his opening comments. We had approximately $30 million year-over-year of favorable cost actions delivered in the quarter, which David Fallon will elaborate on later. From a liquidity standpoint, we had a very strong quarter, ending at $530 million, and we generated over $60 million of free cash flow. Next, on this slide, we do want to provide some range for expected Q3 performance. We are anticipating implications of COVID to continue to fluctuate, but we expect our organic sales to be up between 4% and 6%, and our adjusted EBITDA will be up 10% at the midpoint from Q3 of last year. So while the dynamics can change, we did want to share with you what we are currently seeing playing out in Q3. More on this topic later. Finally, we want to add just a bit of color around 2021. As we see things right now, the demand side is holding up, and our backlog should be robust as we exit the end of this year. We know the dynamics with COVID could ultimately change the top line, but what is in our control is our cost. In Q3, we will be announcing [restructuring] activities that will save us approximately $50 million to $70 million in 2021, with a cash cost to execute of approximately $50 million to $70 million. We are fine-tuning the details, but we feel confident about the programs that underpin these numbers. Turning to Slide 5. We used this slide with our Board last week as a heat map of sorts to illustrate the pockets of strength within each region. The chart is simple, but it relays the real-time view we have on the demand side of things. It is qualitative in nature and to fix our view on the level of health and activity in each of the markets we serve. We continue to see a strong level of activity in every region in the cloud and colocation market, as indicated by the 6 green buttons in the first 2 top rows. Emerging vital applications such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, and that surge in demand is benefiting us as well. In contrast to the cloud and colo business, we see the enterprise and small to medium business continuing to be challenged by COVID, as indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row 3. This segment is spending some money. We have started to see a resurgence from the segment in China, but overall, this classic customer is not spending as they did prior to COVID. Switching to telecom side of things, both Asia and Americas is strong right now. China has gotten on the 5G bandwagon in a major way, and our telecom customers in the U.S. continue to invest in their network, as you can see, indicated by the 2 green buttons in row 4. Finally, our C&I business, more often than not, as we've always said, will track [indiscernible] approximately GDP over the longer run. But sometimes, the quarterly timing can be different. While this segment has held up better than expected, things are relatively flat in this space. So certainly, some puts and takes, but overall, when you consider our mix of data center business, Vertiv is seeing positive growth. The applications people use every day continue to be more and more vital, following the onset of COVID, and those applications need to be processed, stored and transmitted. And all of this continues to be a great backdrop for our business. Moving on to Slide 6. To reiterate, the overall demand is strong and as evidenced by our strong order rates and record backlog. While our channel business is soft due to the enterprise and small and medium business segment being down, our larger project-based orders rates are on track. One thing I haven't touched on yet, though, is site access. Site access in some of the markets is very challenging. We see this continuing to be an area of uncertainty, as governments control access to countries and localities and ultimately, customers control our ability to deliver and install. Singapore, for example, continues to be almost entirely shut down from a data center standpoint. In India, things fluctuate day-to-day and sometimes even an hour-to-hour basis. On the supply side, the majority of our operations are running normally, and we continue to ramp production. My prior comment on India is appropriate from both the standpoint of demand and supply, and Mexico continues to be a daily work item for us as we address the labor issue. Our customers are experiencing constraints by trade industries, which we continue to work through. COVID has strengthened our proficiency in anticipating potential roadblocks and proactively mitigating issues before they become a concern. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave Fallon to walk us through the financials. David?\nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 7. This page summarizes our second quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were down $128 million or 11%, including $28 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency, as most global currencies are weaker versus the U.S. dollar compared to last year, including the euro and the RMB, which represent approximately 60% of our foreign currency exposure. The remaining $100 million reduction in net sales was primarily driven by Americas and EMEA, each organically down double digits as a result of COVID-19 and year-over-year timing of larger projects. Despite the $128 million reduction in net sales, second quarter adjusted EBITDA declined just $2 million and actually increased $5 million when adjusted for foreign currency. Fixed costs were down $35 million from last year's second quarter, primarily as the result of COVID-19 cost actions implemented at the beginning of the quarter, and we still anticipate an approximate $60 million full year benefit from COVID-19 cost actions compared to our beginning of the year guidance, including $35 million in the second quarter, $15 million in the third quarter and $10 million in the fourth quarter. Second quarter contribution margin improved year-over-year due to continued progress with both pricing and productivity initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 150 basis points from last year, primarily driven by this improved contribution margin percentage. Second quarter free cash flow, as we move farthest to the right, improved $128 million from last year's second quarter, in part due to $59 million lower cash interest resulting from the significant debt paydown pursuant to the SPAC transaction and the subsequent debt refinancing. We will review other drivers of higher year-over-year free cash flow in a couple of slides. Next, turning to Slide 8. This page summarizes our second quarter segment results. Organic net sales in the Americas were down [$79 million] or 14%, primarily driven by the continued negative impact from COVID-19 and from the normal variability of year-over-year timing of larger projects, estimated at about $8 million. It was a very similar story in EMEA, where organic net sales declined $32 million or 13%. EMEA was also negatively impacted by COVID-19 and by approximately $15 million from normal variability of larger projects. Organic net sales in APAC increased $11 million, with between $15 million and $20 million of this increase due to the timing of larger projects. Otherwise, relatively flat year-over-year organic net sales in APAC were driven by double-digit growth in China, which represents between 60% to 70% of APAC's top line, and this growth in China was offset by double-digit declines in the rest of Asia, including India, demonstrating that although China seems to be transitioning from the negative effects of COVID-19, certain other geographies within APAC continue to be challenged. From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of sales, increased across the board in all regions, primarily driven by improved contribution margin in both the Americas and EMEA and from lower fixed costs as a percentage of sales in APAC, as fixed costs in that region declined while net sales were relatively flat. Next, turning to Slide 9. The chart on this page bridges second quarter free cash flow from last year. But before reviewing free cash flow, we do want to reiterate our direction from the first quarter earnings call that we continue to hold no concerns related to liquidity, and we're actually incrementally more optimistic based upon the $84 million increase in liquidity during the quarter. We anticipate our liquidity position to grow sequentially at the end of each of the third and fourth quarters based on our expectation of strong free cash flow generation in the second half of the year consistent with timing in prior years. Now returning to the chart. Second quarter free cash flow of $62 million increased $128 million from last year's second quarter, driven by $45 million higher net income despite a $22 million increase in noncash charges, including a $12 million ERP impairment. A significant driver of higher net income was lower interest expense, driven by the SPAC transaction and subsequent debt refinancing. And of course, we had a related $59 million reduction in cash interest, which certainly contributed to the higher year-over-year free cash flow. Cash used for [working capital] declined $44 million, but a good portion of this benefit in the quarter was due to the timing of favorable cash receipts at the end of June, we estimate between $20 million and $30 million that we otherwise expected to receive in the third quarter. Second quarter free cash flow also benefited from lower capital expenditures, but a good portion of this reduction was also due to timing as we deferred CapEx investment to the second half of the year based on the COVID-19 uncertainty we were managing at the beginning of the quarter. Next, turning to Slide 10. This page summarizes our financial guidance for the third quarter, as we illustrated in the earnings release. Although uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 has certainly mitigated since we spoke in early May, there is still lack of sufficient visibility to provide specific financial guidance beyond a few months. Accordingly, we provide our expectations for only third quarter, and this guidance assumes that what we experienced in July continues through August and September, which, of course, is subject to change based upon uncertainty with COVID-19. We are effectively approaching financial guidance for this year, 1 quarter at a time. Based upon what we know today, we expect third quarter organic net sales to increase between 4% and 6% from last year's third quarter. And although projected organic growth from prior year differs by region, with Americas expected to be relatively flat and APAC and EMEA expected to grow mid- to upper single digits, all 3 regions should grow sequentially from the second quarter in upper single digits. This sequential growth is not driven by seasonality as our third quarter net sales declined sequentially from the second quarter in each of the last 2 years. Of course, we expect third quarter net sales in all 3 regions to continue to be negatively influenced by COVID-19 and our top line results will be dependent upon access to customer sites and our customers' ability and willingness to accept shipments. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA of approximately $150 million at the midpoint, 10% higher than last year's third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin to expand approximately 90 basis points at the midpoint, primarily driven by relatively flat fixed cost, fixed cost constant, while top line is growing mid-single digits. Comparing our third quarter guidance to our second quarter results, although top line is expected to grow approximately 10% sequentially at the midpoint, adjusted EBITDA is expected to expand less than 5%. Relatively lower profit growth is driven by higher projected fixed costs in the third quarter versus the second quarter, primarily due to a $20 million reduction in the benefit from COVID-19 cost actions. In addition, we plan that despite the uncertainty related to COVID-19 to continue the ramp-up of R&D and growth initiative spending in the third quarter. Third quarter contribution margin as a percentage of sales is expected to remain relatively consistent with the second quarter. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob.\nRobert Johnson: Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 11. Here's a bit more detail regarding our perspective on 2021. From our radar screen right now, we see the cloud, colocation and telecom markets continuing to be pretty healthy entering into 2021. It's clearly too early to call what the enterprise market will look like, but the total data center landscape we are still expecting to see a growth. Our record backlog of $1.8 billion gives us good visibility and confidence on the revenue side. And towards the back half of 2021, we will start seeing the R&D investments pay off with even more products and solutions hitting the market. On the margin side, as we've discussed several times, we are firm believers and practicers of holding fixed cost constant, and those efforts will be in full swing during 2021. To this end, we plan to announce restructuring actions in Q3, which we will expect to reduce fixed costs by approximately $50 million to $70 million, plus additional variable cost benefit. These projects are varied and are entering into the final scoping stages. To support these fixed cost reduction projects, we anticipate incurring cash costs between $50 million and $70 million, including capital, and we will evaluate these cash costs for a likely restructuring reserve to be recorded in third quarter. So while it's too early, we did want to provide you with a glimpse of what we potentially are seeing play out in 2021, at least based on what we know today. Now turning to Slide 12 and in closing. I want to thank you for your support over the past quarter and in the quarters to come. We participate in a great industry where we have a leadership position and never has critical digital infrastructure to support vital application been so important as it is now. Our backlog, the fixed cost constant approach we have implemented and our liquidity positions are in great shape as we continue to operate during this dynamic time. We continue to invest in the future while simultaneously managing for today. This strategic approach will prepare us to even be more successful when we emerge from this pandemic, and the world adapts to a new normal. Thank you for your support. Stay healthy. I'll now turn the call over to the operator, who will open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: It looks encouraging, the results look encouraging. Outlook looks encouraging. So happy about that. Anyway, I want to get color on a couple of things, if you don't mind, and I hope you can hear me okay. We still have a power outage here in -- where I live in the Northeast, but \u2013\nRobert Johnson: We can hear fine.\nScott Davis: Good. The $60 million cost out for the year, that -- is there any of that $60 million that you think you could hold on to into 2021? I assume these are mostly like lower T&E and things like that, lower comp accruals. But are there parts of that you think that could become permanent, not temporary?\nDavid Fallon: Yes, Scott, this is David. Absolutely. So you hit it on the head, about $20 million of that is discretionary related to T&E, and that is certainly the bucket of costs that we are targeting to effectively keep out of the business heading into next year. And we certainly have learned a new way of doing our business while doing things virtually. So that $20 million, we certainly would target to keep out of the business. But just a quick point. With the macro goal of keeping fixed costs constant, we will target to even offset the other $40 million. So that $40 million, if it does come back into the business, our planning heading into 2021 would be to identify other reductions to offset it. So effectively realizing the benefit of the full $60 million heading into 2021.\nScott Davis: Okay. Helpful. And then just kind of technical question here. The 5G projects, I would imagine they would be somewhat lumpy, maybe not as visible as traditional data center, but I really don't know. It's a newer market, obviously. But can you help us understand what those projects typically look like? And how they might differ from a traditional data center project?\nRobert Johnson: Sure. Scott, this is Rob Johnson. Yes, what we're seeing -- China announced a while back during the COVID, part of their stimulus was to really go after 5G and expand. So they put tens of billions of dollars into doing that. Those projects tend to be smaller, but tend to be tens of thousands of sites. And basically, with 5G, what you have to do is go into that cell tower, upgrade the power system, because 5G does require more power and maybe upgrade the thermal. So the opportunity for us is lots of little sites, but tens of thousands of those. And that's what we're seeing certainly happen in China, and we participate really well in China when it comes to the 5G rollout. Same thing in the U.S., what you're finding is the networks get very constrained because of all the work-from-home, school-from-home. People are upgrading those networks, upgrading, maintaining and upgrading the equipment there. And 5G is, as you know, kind of a race between China and the U.S. of who can get there faster. So we're enjoying that, and I think that trend will continue, not necessarily lumpy, but pretty steady over the next couple of years.\nScott Davis: Okay. Good luck, guys. And congrats Dave Cote on the book. It's a great read. I loved it.\nDavid Cote: You're very kind, Scott, and I appreciate the plug for the book and please, I have to admit I enjoyed yours also, especially that Honeywell chapter. And we hope that in the next book you write, Vertiv will show up.\nScott Davis: I hope so. Good luck. I hope it works out.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes. I thought that the framework around 3Q was helpful, some of the regional color by the top line. But following up on that, is it possible for you guys to kind of parse out -- do you expect to see EBITDA margins up year-on-year across all 3 regions like you were able to do this quarter? Or is there any lumpiness things that we should be aware of?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. Nicole, this is David Fallon. I would say, although we don't want to necessarily give guidance in particular by region, our expectation would be that, that would be spread across all 3 regions. Implicit in the guide is effectively that fixed cost will be flat this year versus last year. And based on the leverage across the 3 regions, we would anticipate EBITDA margins to increase globally. And that's even with contribution margin likely staying relatively flat. So we would anticipate higher adjusted EBITDA margins to be spread across all 3 regions.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Okay. And then totally understand the lack of visibility here in the current environment. But just as we're framing our own models into the fourth quarter, what kind of seasonality do you guys typically see that we should be aware of? And I guess on top of that, the large project lumpiness, is there anything to think about with respect to year-on-year versus 4Q '19?\nRobert Johnson: Yes. Nicole, I'll start, and then David can chime in. Typically, the second half of the year is bigger than the first half. So that's kind of -- and fourth quarter, it's typically our largest quarter in the year. The big projects ebb and flow, and sometimes we talk about that and say, we had a big project in EMEA this year, and we didn't -- that didn't repeat itself. But what I would say is what we're seeing is strength, as we talked about, Nicole, and hyperscale, which tend to be larger projects, and we're seeing that not just in any particular region, but all the regions. And what's going to be important for us going forward for the second half is how site access and how delivery and how the availability of the trades are there to be able to deliver. There's certainly, as you can see by our backlog, a pent-up demand and trade constraints can be a problem, inside access can be a problem. But in general, we'll see for certain a larger Q3 and then a larger Q4.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Lance Vitanza with Cowen.\nLance Vitanza: I guess I want to just sort of better understand the 3Q guide for adjusted EBITDA. In the context, just given how strong the performance was in the second quarter and the favorable revenue guide for Q3, I thought that the adjusted EBITDA guide seemed -- actually seemed a little light as you have margin on a quarter-on-quarter basis actually going down about 75 basis points or so despite sequential sales growth. So I'm just wondering, I know, obviously, you talked a little bit about the COVID cost actions, the $30 million that benefited the second quarter. And I guess I would have thought -- I know you talked about this a couple of seconds ago, but a little bit more would have kind of carried into the third quarter. So I'm just wondering, to what extent are you -- are you giving yourselves just some room to maneuver here? Or is there something in particular that we should be thinking about that would lead to that kind of a margin performance in the third quarter?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Lance. This is David. And first, I'll lead off. We always like the midpoint of our guidance. We likely will provide ranges, but we're generally comfortable at the midpoint. And I can help you with the $150 million adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint and how that walks from the $145 million from the second quarter. So being a finance guy, we try to get things as quantitative as possible. So we have about $100 million increase in sales from Q2 to Q3. And if you throw a 40% to 45% contribution margin against that, you get about $40 million, $45 million of benefit. And the headwind is certainly going to be on the fixed cost side as we talked about on -- in the prepared remarks. And that could be in that $35 million plus range. And $20 million of that is going to be related to lower benefits from the COVID actions. And these are things that we benefited from in Q2 that we won't benefit in -- from -- in Q3, including furloughs and in certain geographies, we were able to receive some government subsidies. So that's a good portion of the higher fixed costs. The other component is our commitment to continue to invest in strategic initiatives. And this is something that we talked about on the last couple of calls. Heading into this year, our plan was to continue to invest in R&D. As we continue to increase that spend as a percentage of sales, we continue to invest in markets that we believe have higher potential and profitable growth, including the channel. In addition, we have some digital projects that we continue to invest in. So the spending for those strategic initiatives ramp-up in the third quarter. And that explains the remainder of the fixed costs increase sequentially from Q2 to Q3.\nLance Vitanza: Super helpful. If I could just squeeze in one more on liquidity. You mentioned that you're less worried about -- even less worried about liquidity, given the outperformance on cash flow in the second quarter. So the implication of that is that, that $60 million of cash was not pulled forward from what you otherwise would have expected to generate in the second half. And I know you talked about you're still expecting a good second half. But it sounds like this is really like just incremental to what you would have expected when you were making your budget, say, at the beginning of the year. Is that fair?\nDavid Fallon: I think that's partially fair. Mr. Cote always reminds us how conservative finance guys can be. And when we look at cash flow, we certainly error on the side of being a little bit more conservative. But our second quarter free cash flow performance certainly was encouraging. I think at this time in May, we hint it towards maybe a slightly negative free cash flow for Q2. So we certainly outperformed that. I did mention some of the favorable performance was based on timing of cash receipts. So we received between $20 million and $30 million literally in the last day of the month that we had anticipated to receive sometime mid-July. So that's helped and certainly would borrow from Q3. But even with that taken into account, our Q2 free cash flow was better than what we anticipated. And certainly, lends to the optimism that we have both for liquidity and related free cash flow generation for Q3 and Q4.\nRobert Johnson: And Lance, just one little -- just further color on that, I would say that you, I think, used the words maybe less worried. We're not worried about our liquidity. We actually feel really good about our liquidity position, where we're going through this COVID-19 time. So there's no worries, and we only see that getting stronger as we get to finish throughout the rest of this second half of the year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Mark Delaney at GS.\nMark Delaney: I was hoping first to better understand the comments the company was making about backlog. And if I understood properly, the company is expecting backlog to be at a good level exiting the year. Can you elaborate on what's giving the company the confidence that the backlog is going to stay high as you move through the rest of this year? And perhaps you could also speak more specifically to your expectations for the hyperscale portion of your business. And how you're thinking about the sustainability of that end market which certainly has a lot of good secular growth over the long term, as how Dave has described it in the past. But there's some debate in the investment community about whether some of the spending going on in hyperscale this year is pull ahead of demand.\nRobert Johnson: Mark, this is Rob Johnson. I'll start off here. First of all, what gives us confidence in the continued strong backlog going into 2021 is our visibility in both our pipeline, which is very strong globally. And what we're seeing from an orders and expectation for orders growth. So we do expect to see orders grow in the second half. And -- so that gives us the confidence going through, those 2 things that I look at, which pipeline is a huge indicator of where things are going. I can't anticipate what's going to happen on the enterprise and small to medium business, but that's even a plus if they come -- the recovery comes faster, I would say, in the second half. As it relates to hyperscale, what we're seeing globally is a combination of things. It's not just the hyperscale building out to build out. There's a lot of data sovereignty. You've seen a lot of stuff around people wanting data to stay in their country. So what we're seeing is a proliferation of data centers, and we'll continue to see that really data centers in-country, for-country type of thing. And there's a lot of build out going on in Europe. Europe is red hot when it comes to that. Certainly seeing it in the Middle East, Africa. And then just really around the world, South America. So we continue to see data is not slowing down, the rate of growth of data that has to be processed and stored. So we're not looking at this as a bubble that hyperscale is building out or colocation is building out too much capacity. From our lens, the next 18, 24 months, we see just a strong demand and a need for data centers. There was a pause as we talked about last year, a little bit of digestion, as I'd say. I'd say we're probably a little bit behind now in order to fulfill the capacity that's needed. So we do expect to see hyperscale grow. But we lump hyperscale and colocation together because a lot of the colocation companies, certainly outside of the U.S., are providing that capacity for those hyperscalers.\nMark Delaney: That's very helpful. For my second question, I was hoping to better understand some of the dynamics in the channel business. And the company talked about it being soft. I think that was just from a cyclical and end market perspective, but taking share within channel has been one of the opportunities the company has focused on. Has that share gain opportunity been disruptive because of the COVID challenges and some of that end market weakness? Or do you still feel confident about the company's ability to take share within the channel business over time?\nRobert Johnson: Yes. No, great question. And you know channel is a huge part of our strategy and a huge investment for us. Pre-COVID, we felt really good about our execution in the channel on a global basis that we were taking share, and we're doing that through providing innovative products and new solutions. We've had a plethora of launches and we'll continue to launch throughout this year and broaden our scope of offering of innovative products and solutions, as well as being that easy-to-do, easy-button-to-go-to company. And being less distributed or, I would call, under distributed, not over distributed, like some of our competition and picking who we want to do business with has really helped us concentrate, focus and gain share and get closer and tighter with them. So what I would say is while the overall channel has been impacted by the small and medium business, we expect that to come back at some point in time, and we'll continue to execute and be in a much stronger position because we continue to launch new products and programs in the channel. So I'm very bullish on a global basis that we'll see, as the recovery comes back, us doing what we said we're going to do, and that's take share and grow in some new categories in the channel space.\nMark Delaney: Just lastly for me. I do want to better understand the impact of COVID on your business this year. I think in the first quarter call, the company had talked about $80 million of revenue and $30 million of EBITDA that was negatively impacted because of COVID. And I apologize if I just missed it, I didn't catch an update on what COVID may have done to fundamentals in the second quarter. Is there any more quantitative or qualitative color you can provide about how COVID may be impacting your ability to complete projects in 2Q or in the 3Q guidance from a revenue and a cost perspective?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. I think as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks that certain geographies certainly continue to be negatively impacted. And certainly, if you look at lower year-over-year sales, those are a lot easier to attribute directly to COVID. I would say, universally, if you look at our production and operations that we had a minimal impact, being able to procure supply and produce product and we had very little operational issues, if you will. So we didn't specifically call out a dollar impact on the top line related to COVID. And that's primarily because we look at everything that we're dealing with today as kind of fungible with COVID-19. So overall, I think, organically, our sales were off $100 million versus last year. One of the things that we called out specifically in the first quarter year-over-year was the impact of large projects. And that certainly impacted us in Q2, but it was more regional based. If you look at it overall, we probably only had about a $5 million headwind from the timing of large projects from last year's second quarter. So if you want to attribute the remainder reduction of the $95 million to COVID, I wouldn't stop you, but it's really hard for us to specifically say what subcomponents of that $90 million is COVID or that we otherwise would have been able to deliver to customers.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. So that ends the Q&A session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks.\nRobert Johnson: Thank you, operator. I'm going to close the call by thanking our 19,000 plus employees around the world for their hard work that they're doing every day to take care of our customers. We appreciate everyone's time today. As I said earlier, please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking with you again. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 7. This page summarizes our second quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were down $128 million or 11%, including $28 million due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency, as most global currencies are weaker versus the U.S. dollar compared to last year, including the euro and the RMB, which represent approximately 60% of our foreign currency exposure. The remaining $100 million reduction in net sales was primarily driven by Americas and EMEA, each organically down double digits as a result of COVID-19 and year-over-year timing of larger projects. Despite the $128 million reduction in net sales, second quarter adjusted EBITDA declined just $2 million and actually increased $5 million when adjusted for foreign currency. Fixed costs were down $35 million from last year's second quarter, primarily as the result of COVID-19 cost actions implemented at the beginning of the quarter, and we still anticipate an approximate $60 million full year benefit from COVID-19 cost actions compared to our beginning of the year guidance, including $35 million in the second quarter, $15 million in the third quarter and $10 million in the fourth quarter. Second quarter contribution margin improved year-over-year due to continued progress with both pricing and productivity initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 150 basis points from last year, primarily driven by this improved contribution margin percentage. Second quarter free cash flow, as we move farthest to the right, improved $128 million from last year's second quarter, in part due to $59 million lower cash interest resulting from the significant debt paydown pursuant to the SPAC transaction and the subsequent debt refinancing. We will review other drivers of higher year-over-year free cash flow in a couple of slides. Next, turning to Slide 8. This page summarizes our second quarter segment results. Organic net sales in the Americas were down [$79 million] or 14%, primarily driven by the continued negative impact from COVID-19 and from the normal variability of year-over-year timing of larger projects, estimated at about $8 million. It was a very similar story in EMEA, where organic net sales declined $32 million or 13%. EMEA was also negatively impacted by COVID-19 and by approximately $15 million from normal variability of larger projects. Organic net sales in APAC increased $11 million, with between $15 million and $20 million of this increase due to the timing of larger projects. Otherwise, relatively flat year-over-year organic net sales in APAC were driven by double-digit growth in China, which represents between 60% to 70% of APAC's top line, and this growth in China was offset by double-digit declines in the rest of Asia, including India, demonstrating that although China seems to be transitioning from the negative effects of COVID-19, certain other geographies within APAC continue to be challenged. From a profitability perspective, adjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of sales, increased across the board in all regions, primarily driven by improved contribution margin in both the Americas and EMEA and from lower fixed costs as a percentage of sales in APAC, as fixed costs in that region declined while net sales were relatively flat. Next, turning to Slide 9. The chart on this page bridges second quarter free cash flow from last year. But before reviewing free cash flow, we do want to reiterate our direction from the first quarter earnings call that we continue to hold no concerns related to liquidity, and we're actually incrementally more optimistic based upon the $84 million increase in liquidity during the quarter. We anticipate our liquidity position to grow sequentially at the end of each of the third and fourth quarters based on our expectation of strong free cash flow generation in the second half of the year consistent with timing in prior years. Now returning to the chart. Second quarter free cash flow of $62 million increased $128 million from last year's second quarter, driven by $45 million higher net income despite a $22 million increase in noncash charges, including a $12 million ERP impairment. A significant driver of higher net income was lower interest expense, driven by the SPAC transaction and subsequent debt refinancing. And of course, we had a related $59 million reduction in cash interest, which certainly contributed to the higher year-over-year free cash flow. Cash used for [working capital] declined $44 million, but a good portion of this benefit in the quarter was due to the timing of favorable cash receipts at the end of June, we estimate between $20 million and $30 million that we otherwise expected to receive in the third quarter. Second quarter free cash flow also benefited from lower capital expenditures, but a good portion of this reduction was also due to timing as we deferred CapEx investment to the second half of the year based on the COVID-19 uncertainty we were managing at the beginning of the quarter. Next, turning to Slide 10. This page summarizes our financial guidance for the third quarter, as we illustrated in the earnings release. Although uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 has certainly mitigated since we spoke in early May, there is still lack of sufficient visibility to provide specific financial guidance beyond a few months. Accordingly, we provide our expectations for only third quarter, and this guidance assumes that what we experienced in July continues through August and September, which, of course, is subject to change based upon uncertainty with COVID-19. We are effectively approaching financial guidance for this year, 1 quarter at a time. Based upon what we know today, we expect third quarter organic net sales to increase between 4% and 6% from last year's third quarter. And although projected organic growth from prior year differs by region, with Americas expected to be relatively flat and APAC and EMEA expected to grow mid- to upper single digits, all 3 regions should grow sequentially from the second quarter in upper single digits. This sequential growth is not driven by seasonality as our third quarter net sales declined sequentially from the second quarter in each of the last 2 years. Of course, we expect third quarter net sales in all 3 regions to continue to be negatively influenced by COVID-19 and our top line results will be dependent upon access to customer sites and our customers' ability and willingness to accept shipments. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA of approximately $150 million at the midpoint, 10% higher than last year's third quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin to expand approximately 90 basis points at the midpoint, primarily driven by relatively flat fixed cost, fixed cost constant, while top line is growing mid-single digits. Comparing our third quarter guidance to our second quarter results, although top line is expected to grow approximately 10% sequentially at the midpoint, adjusted EBITDA is expected to expand less than 5%. Relatively lower profit growth is driven by higher projected fixed costs in the third quarter versus the second quarter, primarily due to a $20 million reduction in the benefit from COVID-19 cost actions. In addition, we plan that despite the uncertainty related to COVID-19 to continue the ramp-up of R&D and growth initiative spending in the third quarter. Third quarter contribution margin as a percentage of sales is expected to remain relatively consistent with the second quarter. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Yes, Scott, this is David. Absolutely. So you hit it on the head, about $20 million of that is discretionary related to T&E, and that is certainly the bucket of costs that we are targeting to effectively keep out of the business heading into next year. And we certainly have learned a new way of doing our business while doing things virtually. So that $20 million, we certainly would target to keep out of the business. But just a quick point. With the macro goal of keeping fixed costs constant, we will target to even offset the other $40 million. So that $40 million, if it does come back into the business, our planning heading into 2021 would be to identify other reductions to offset it. So effectively realizing the benefit of the full $60 million heading into 2021. Yes. Nicole, this is David Fallon. I would say, although we don't want to necessarily give guidance in particular by region, our expectation would be that, that would be spread across all 3 regions. Implicit in the guide is effectively that fixed cost will be flat this year versus last year. And based on the leverage across the 3 regions, we would anticipate EBITDA margins to increase globally. And that's even with contribution margin likely staying relatively flat. So we would anticipate higher adjusted EBITDA margins to be spread across all 3 regions. Yes. Thanks, Lance. This is David. And first, I'll lead off. We always like the midpoint of our guidance. We likely will provide ranges, but we're generally comfortable at the midpoint. And I can help you with the $150 million adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint and how that walks from the $145 million from the second quarter. So being a finance guy, we try to get things as quantitative as possible. So we have about $100 million increase in sales from Q2 to Q3. And if you throw a 40% to 45% contribution margin against that, you get about $40 million, $45 million of benefit. And the headwind is certainly going to be on the fixed cost side as we talked about on -- in the prepared remarks. And that could be in that $35 million plus range. And $20 million of that is going to be related to lower benefits from the COVID actions. And these are things that we benefited from in Q2 that we won't benefit in -- from -- in Q3, including furloughs and in certain geographies, we were able to receive some government subsidies. So that's a good portion of the higher fixed costs. The other component is our commitment to continue to invest in strategic initiatives. And this is something that we talked about on the last couple of calls. Heading into this year, our plan was to continue to invest in R&D. As we continue to increase that spend as a percentage of sales, we continue to invest in markets that we believe have higher potential and profitable growth, including the channel. In addition, we have some digital projects that we continue to invest in. So the spending for those strategic initiatives ramp-up in the third quarter. And that explains the remainder of the fixed costs increase sequentially from Q2 to Q3. I think that's partially fair. Mr. Cote always reminds us how conservative finance guys can be. And when we look at cash flow, we certainly error on the side of being a little bit more conservative. But our second quarter free cash flow performance certainly was encouraging. I think at this time in May, we hint it towards maybe a slightly negative free cash flow for Q2. So we certainly outperformed that. I did mention some of the favorable performance was based on timing of cash receipts. So we received between $20 million and $30 million literally in the last day of the month that we had anticipated to receive sometime mid-July. So that's helped and certainly would borrow from Q3. But even with that taken into account, our Q2 free cash flow was better than what we anticipated. And certainly, lends to the optimism that we have both for liquidity and related free cash flow generation for Q3 and Q4. Yes. I think as Rob mentioned in his prepared remarks that certain geographies certainly continue to be negatively impacted. And certainly, if you look at lower year-over-year sales, those are a lot easier to attribute directly to COVID. I would say, universally, if you look at our production and operations that we had a minimal impact, being able to procure supply and produce product and we had very little operational issues, if you will.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the slide, I want to tell you about how proud I am of the Vertiv team. Serving customers during the pandemic has not been without its challenges. Employees across the company and located in countries across the globe have addressed issues of all kinds brought on by COVID. And they've done it creatively, they've done it energetically and they've done it passionately. I couldn't ask for a better team, and I'm truly grateful to them and for how they have always put the customer first. Let's get into the slides. On Slide 4, overall, the demand side of our business held up as orders were up 5% organically from Q2 2019. Last quarter, we talked about exiting with an all-time high backlog of $1.6 billion. And now I'm proud and happy to report that our backlog is even greater than that at about approximately $1.8 billion. We will talk over the next few slides about both the supply and the demand side of our business. From a profitability standpoint, we delivered $145 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is relatively flat from last year's Q2. Although Q2 had $128 million lower sales than Q2 of 2019, we managed our contribution margins very well and held our cost in line, as Dave Cote mentioned in his opening comments. We had approximately $30 million year-over-year of favorable cost actions delivered in the quarter, which David Fallon will elaborate on later. From a liquidity standpoint, we had a very strong quarter, ending at $530 million, and we generated over $60 million of free cash flow. Next, on this slide, we do want to provide some range for expected Q3 performance. We are anticipating implications of COVID to continue to fluctuate, but we expect our organic sales to be up between 4% and 6%, and our adjusted EBITDA will be up 10% at the midpoint from Q3 of last year. So while the dynamics can change, we did want to share with you what we are currently seeing playing out in Q3. More on this topic later. Finally, we want to add just a bit of color around 2021. As we see things right now, the demand side is holding up, and our backlog should be robust as we exit the end of this year. We know the dynamics with COVID could ultimately change the top line, but what is in our control is our cost. In Q3, we will be announcing [restructuring] activities that will save us approximately $50 million to $70 million in 2021, with a cash cost to execute of approximately $50 million to $70 million. We are fine-tuning the details, but we feel confident about the programs that underpin these numbers. Turning to Slide 5. We used this slide with our Board last week as a heat map of sorts to illustrate the pockets of strength within each region. The chart is simple, but it relays the real-time view we have on the demand side of things. It is qualitative in nature and to fix our view on the level of health and activity in each of the markets we serve. We continue to see a strong level of activity in every region in the cloud and colocation market, as indicated by the 6 green buttons in the first 2 top rows. Emerging vital applications such as online education, telemedicine, video and gaming are benefiting our cloud and colocation customers, and that surge in demand is benefiting us as well. In contrast to the cloud and colo business, we see the enterprise and small to medium business continuing to be challenged by COVID, as indicated by the red and yellow buttons in row 3. This segment is spending some money. We have started to see a resurgence from the segment in China, but overall, this classic customer is not spending as they did prior to COVID. Switching to telecom side of things, both Asia and Americas is strong right now. China has gotten on the 5G bandwagon in a major way, and our telecom customers in the U.S. continue to invest in their network, as you can see, indicated by the 2 green buttons in row 4. Finally, our C&I business, more often than not, as we've always said, will track [indiscernible] approximately GDP over the longer run. But sometimes, the quarterly timing can be different. While this segment has held up better than expected, things are relatively flat in this space. So certainly, some puts and takes, but overall, when you consider our mix of data center business, Vertiv is seeing positive growth. The applications people use every day continue to be more and more vital, following the onset of COVID, and those applications need to be processed, stored and transmitted. And all of this continues to be a great backdrop for our business. Moving on to Slide 6. To reiterate, the overall demand is strong and as evidenced by our strong order rates and record backlog. While our channel business is soft due to the enterprise and small and medium business segment being down, our larger project-based orders rates are on track. One thing I haven't touched on yet, though, is site access. Site access in some of the markets is very challenging. We see this continuing to be an area of uncertainty, as governments control access to countries and localities and ultimately, customers control our ability to deliver and install. Singapore, for example, continues to be almost entirely shut down from a data center standpoint. In India, things fluctuate day-to-day and sometimes even an hour-to-hour basis. On the supply side, the majority of our operations are running normally, and we continue to ramp production. My prior comment on India is appropriate from both the standpoint of demand and supply, and Mexico continues to be a daily work item for us as we address the labor issue. Our customers are experiencing constraints by trade industries, which we continue to work through. COVID has strengthened our proficiency in anticipating potential roadblocks and proactively mitigating issues before they become a concern. With that, I'll turn it over to Dave Fallon to walk us through the financials. David? Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 11. Here's a bit more detail regarding our perspective on 2021. From our radar screen right now, we see the cloud, colocation and telecom markets continuing to be pretty healthy entering into 2021. It's clearly too early to call what the enterprise market will look like, but the total data center landscape we are still expecting to see a growth. Our record backlog of $1.8 billion gives us good visibility and confidence on the revenue side. And towards the back half of 2021, we will start seeing the R&D investments pay off with even more products and solutions hitting the market. On the margin side, as we've discussed several times, we are firm believers and practicers of holding fixed cost constant, and those efforts will be in full swing during 2021. To this end, we plan to announce restructuring actions in Q3, which we will expect to reduce fixed costs by approximately $50 million to $70 million, plus additional variable cost benefit. These projects are varied and are entering into the final scoping stages. To support these fixed cost reduction projects, we anticipate incurring cash costs between $50 million and $70 million, including capital, and we will evaluate these cash costs for a likely restructuring reserve to be recorded in third quarter. So while it's too early, we did want to provide you with a glimpse of what we potentially are seeing play out in 2021, at least based on what we know today. Now turning to Slide 12 and in closing. I want to thank you for your support over the past quarter and in the quarters to come. We participate in a great industry where we have a leadership position and never has critical digital infrastructure to support vital application been so important as it is now. Our backlog, the fixed cost constant approach we have implemented and our liquidity positions are in great shape as we continue to operate during this dynamic time. We continue to invest in the future while simultaneously managing for today. This strategic approach will prepare us to even be more successful when we emerge from this pandemic, and the world adapts to a new normal. Thank you for your support. Stay healthy. I'll now turn the call over to the operator, who will open it up for questions. We can hear fine. Sure. Scott, this is Rob Johnson. Yes, what we're seeing -- China announced a while back during the COVID, part of their stimulus was to really go after 5G and expand. So they put tens of billions of dollars into doing that. Those projects tend to be smaller, but tend to be tens of thousands of sites. And basically, with 5G, what you have to do is go into that cell tower, upgrade the power system, because 5G does require more power and maybe upgrade the thermal. So the opportunity for us is lots of little sites, but tens of thousands of those. And that's what we're seeing certainly happen in China, and we participate really well in China when it comes to the 5G rollout. Same thing in the U.S., what you're finding is the networks get very constrained because of all the work-from-home, school-from-home. People are upgrading those networks, upgrading, maintaining and upgrading the equipment there. And 5G is, as you know, kind of a race between China and the U.S. of who can get there faster. So we're enjoying that, and I think that trend will continue, not necessarily lumpy, but pretty steady over the next couple of years. Yes. Nicole, I'll start, and then David can chime in. Typically, the second half of the year is bigger than the first half. So that's kind of -- and fourth quarter, it's typically our largest quarter in the year. The big projects ebb and flow, and sometimes we talk about that and say, we had a big project in EMEA this year, and we didn't -- that didn't repeat itself. But what I would say is what we're seeing is strength, as we talked about, Nicole, and hyperscale, which tend to be larger projects, and we're seeing that not just in any particular region, but all the regions. And what's going to be important for us going forward for the second half is how site access and how delivery and how the availability of the trades are there to be able to deliver. There's certainly, as you can see by our backlog, a pent-up demand and trade constraints can be a problem, inside access can be a problem. But in general, we'll see for certain a larger Q3 and then a larger Q4. And Lance, just one little -- just further color on that, I would say that you, I think, used the words maybe less worried. We're not worried about our liquidity. We actually feel really good about our liquidity position, where we're going through this COVID-19 time. So there's no worries, and we only see that getting stronger as we get to finish throughout the rest of this second half of the year. Mark, this is Rob Johnson. I'll start off here. First of all, what gives us confidence in the continued strong backlog going into 2021 is our visibility in both our pipeline, which is very strong globally. And what we're seeing from an orders and expectation for orders growth. So we do expect to see orders grow in the second half. And -- so that gives us the confidence going through, those 2 things that I look at, which pipeline is a huge indicator of where things are going. I can't anticipate what's going to happen on the enterprise and small to medium business, but that's even a plus if they come -- the recovery comes faster, I would say, in the second half. As it relates to hyperscale, what we're seeing globally is a combination of things. It's not just the hyperscale building out to build out. There's a lot of data sovereignty. You've seen a lot of stuff around people wanting data to stay in their country. So what we're seeing is a proliferation of data centers, and we'll continue to see that really data centers in-country, for-country type of thing. And there's a lot of build out going on in Europe. Europe is red hot when it comes to that. Certainly seeing it in the Middle East, Africa. And then just really around the world, South America. So we continue to see data is not slowing down, the rate of growth of data that has to be processed and stored. So we're not looking at this as a bubble that hyperscale is building out or colocation is building out too much capacity. From our lens, the next 18, 24 months, we see just a strong demand and a need for data centers. There was a pause as we talked about last year, a little bit of digestion, as I'd say. I'd say we're probably a little bit behind now in order to fulfill the capacity that's needed. So we do expect to see hyperscale grow. But we lump hyperscale and colocation together because a lot of the colocation companies, certainly outside of the U.S., are providing that capacity for those hyperscalers. Yes. No, great question. And you know channel is a huge part of our strategy and a huge investment for us. Pre-COVID, we felt really good about our execution in the channel on a global basis that we were taking share, and we're doing that through providing innovative products and new solutions. We've had a plethora of launches and we'll continue to launch throughout this year and broaden our scope of offering of innovative products and solutions, as well as being that easy-to-do, easy-button-to-go-to company. And being less distributed or, I would call, under distributed, not over distributed, like some of our competition and picking who we want to do business with has really helped us concentrate, focus and gain share and get closer and tighter with them. So what I would say is while the overall channel has been impacted by the small and medium business, we expect that to come back at some point in time, and we'll continue to execute and be in a much stronger position because we continue to launch new products and programs in the channel. So I'm very bullish on a global basis that we'll see, as the recovery comes back, us doing what we said we're going to do, and that's take share and grow in some new categories in the channel space. Thank you, operator. I'm going to close the call by thanking our 19,000 plus employees around the world for their hard work that they're doing every day to take care of our customers. We appreciate everyone's time today. As I said earlier, please stay safe, and we look forward to speaking with you again. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. When the last time we spoke in early May, everyone was still trying to determine what the implications of COVID were going to be and exactly what type of recession we were going to have. Well, today, 3 months later, while some things are more clear, there are also many things that are still not clear. What is clear, however, is how Vertiv is executing during this time. As many of you know, one of my mantras in business is growing while holding fixed costs constant. And while that's easy in theory, it's not so easy in practice. What I can tell you is that both Rob and Dave Fallon have fully embraced the concept and are deploying it within Vertiv in an aggressive manner. One of my other beliefs is achieving 2 seemingly conflicting objectives at the same time. Where this seems difficult, it is, in fact, very doable. Inside of Vertiv, we're employing the same mindset by managing our costs very closely, but at the same time, we've been ramping up R&D spending so we continue innovating for our customers today and tomorrow. We're also working on strategy development. Just a few week ago, Rob's team went through a week-long strategy review that I participated in for its entirety. Don't worry, it was all remote. There is absolutely no shortage of ideas on how to grow our top and bottom line. Now there's a lot of work to do to bring this to life, but it sure was a great starting point for the company. We can't know for sure the economic environment globally over the next several months, but I am very confident in our ability to navigate these waters and come out the other side a significantly better company. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. You're very kind, Scott, and I appreciate the plug for the book and please, I have to admit I enjoyed yours also, especially that Honeywell chapter. And we hope that in the next book you write, Vertiv will show up."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Ms. Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nLynne Maxeiner;Vice President of Investor Relations: Thank you, Nick. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, David Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem. \n Before we begin, I would like to point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement, our proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. \n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide decks found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, David Cote. \nDavid Cote: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to welcome you to the Vertiv investor call to announce our Q1 2020 results. Before I turn it over to Rob Johnson, I want to begin with a few opening remarks. As we spoke last time, and as many of you know, I was fortunate to be able to work for Honeywell for about 16 years. Those who invested with us made a great return. That performance was marked by consistent annual improvements in the people, processes and portfolio of the businesses that made up Honeywell. We did all the seed planting for new products, services, process improvement and other growth initiatives needed to perform well for a long time. \n The world is in a very different place than when we spoke a couple of months ago. But those opening remarks stay true, whether we are in a period of economic expansion or economic contraction. If you look at our success at Honeywell, it really took off after the Great Recession. And I attribute that success largely to the fact that we continue to implement an operating system, we drove technology investments, and we planted seeds even during that difficult time. \n Why do I bring it up? Because we're doing that same kind of seed planting at Vertiv. Now some of you may conflate our withdrawal of guidance even in the face of good orders growth, with the liquidity scenarios we've included, and conclude we see a serious problem looming. That would be an error. They are 2 entirely separate points. We've withdrawn guidance because we can't be sure we can ship given government shutdown of facilities for us and suppliers at various times. Additionally, our service people sometimes aren't allowed access to facilities. Our credibility matters greatly to us. And we don't want to guide to numbers we may not be able to deliver even in the face of strong orders. \n Totally separately, we have included a couple of liquidity scenarios to demonstrate that even if sales fell to $4 billion or even in a 25% sales decline, we will be just fine. It's not a forecast, it's an attempt to make you feel comfortable that we're just fine. Combining these 2 separate points, into the erroneous conclusion that we are forecasting disaster is, well, erroneous. This time has been difficult for everyone. But it also has demonstrated how important data centers and the edge are to our society. It is clearly critical infrastructure and reaffirmation this is a good industry. We have a great position in that good industry. And even at this difficult time, we are investing in the future. Based on how we're running the business during extraordinarily difficult times, including our own customer focus while still seed planting, I am just as excited today as I was 3 months ago about our future. \n Now I'll turn over the call to Rob who can take you through the business in a little more detail. Rob? \nRob Johnson: Thank you, Dave, and welcome, everyone, today. As I said on the last call, I really value the advice that Dave has provided to the team since he's been engaged with Vertiv. And I especially appreciate his counsel now as we navigate through these pandemic times. Before I walk you through the slide, it goes without saying that we have been proactive in protecting the safety of our employees and our customers. We've implemented precautionary measures from temperature screening to increased cleaning and disinfecting of facilities to social distancing at work, just to name a few. Additionally, our service technicians have followed Vertiv's safety protocols and adhered to additional safety measures adopted at customer sites. \n Safety of our Vertiv employees and our customers has been and will continue to be at the forefront of everything we do. I want to thank the Vertiv employees for their hard work during Q1 and give a shout out to the manufacturing workers and the service technicians who continue to provide products and services to our customers and conduct day-to-day business with the utmost of caution amidst COVID-19. I appreciate their steadfast commitment to Vertiv. It's their unwavering dedication that has allowed us to serve our customers, enable those customers to provide technology and vital applications to the world that they rely on more than ever. To all of our employees on the front line, I say thank you. \n Let's take a look at the slides, starting with Slide 4. Overall, the demand side of our business was very robust in Q1 as orders were up 13% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We exited Q1 with a record high backlog of $1.6 billion, which can be attributed to cloud, colocation and telecom customers around the world who are delivering vital applications so students could be educated online, hospitals and health care facilities could function, workers could work from home and businesses experiencing a surge in demand during the stay-at-home mandate could deliver. \n On the revenue side, despite almost all of our manufacturing facilities being up and running, we have been deemed essential. We were still adversely impacted by COVID as many of our facilities are still dealing with some level of disruption. Additionally, Q1 of 2019 had a few large projects complete, which made a difficult comparison. In Q1, we proactively implemented cost actions to protect the business having seen and felt the impact of COVID in China before things spread to other parts of the world. These cost actions are expected to generate $60 million of benefit by the end of the year. David will address liquidity later, but we feel good about our position today and know that even under a variety of downside scenarios that Dave spoke to, we will be able to maintain our strong liquidity base. \n [ We stay close ] to our customers and continually monitor and comply with directives of governments around the world as they relate to pandemic actions. This pandemic has put us and others in a position where things will remain dynamic and unpredictable over the next several months. Because of this, we are withdrawing our previous guidance. I can tell you this, however, Vertiv has been designated as an essential business. We see strong demand for our products and services. We are taking short-term and long-term actions to make sure we continue to serve our customers. We are nimble, flexible and responsive. We are ready to adapt, react and serve in ways that will be needed for today and tomorrow and in the future. \n Turning to Slide 5. There's a lot of content on this slide, so I won't hit every bullet. But we wanted to provide you with additional knowledge and deeper insight about our business. The first quarter COVID impact of $80 million was roughly 60% supply-based and 40% demand-based. On the supply side, I'm proud to tell you that all of our facilities, with the exception of a small plant in China, are back up and running. Now not all of our facilities are running at 100% because there are still many things they are struggling with: parts issues, logistics constraints, but nonetheless, we are able to operate at some level in every region. \n The supply side is aggressively being monitored on a daily basis as issues arise. Whether it's government health inspections, supplier output, logistics and many more, there's just a myriad of obstacles that our team has to continue to overcome on a daily basis. The Vertiv team has done an outstanding job to carefully and methodically resolve these issues as they arise in places all over the globe, so we continue to supply products to our customers and assist them with their services needs. \n Moving on to the demand side. Certainly, the headline number of orders being up 13% is great accomplishment of the sales and marketing team. Each region grew orders substantially with EMEA leading the way at 26% year-over-year growth in Q1. The orders were largely driven by cloud, large colocation and telecommunication companies. The area where we saw softness was within the small- and medium-sized business that is served by our IT channel partners who have been adversely affected by the pandemic. As this segment of the business starts to come back, we expect to see demand continue. \n Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned previously, we were in early identifying, addressing and implementing a number of different cost actions for Q1. The entire leadership team and Board of Directors took a 10% base pay cut. While this may not be new news to most of you, what you didn't know is that they volunteered to do this. I didn't even have to ask them. \n Additionally, merit increases for employees were halted for 2020. The 401(k) match in the U.S. has been stopped, and every department has been tasked with a discretionary 15% cut. Furthermore, Dave mentioned in his opening remarks about use of furloughs, and we have implemented those across every function and every jurisdiction where it's allowed. Employees have been understanding and supportive of our efforts to utilize these measures to make sure Vertiv stays strong and financially healthy. These actions and a few others will contribute to $60 million of P&L benefit during the rest of 2020. \n We are also being aggressive on the revenue side. Our sales and service teams are strengthening ties with the customer, providing updates and reassurances to them regularly. We have enhanced our marketing message and increased our social media presence as we look for additional ways to reach those in need of the products and services that we provide. The selfless nature of our 19,000-plus employees is a testament to the culture of the organization. Our desire to be present and helpful to those who need us, our willingness to work while we battle COVID-19, I am proud of the way Vertiv and its team have acted and reacted to all the unknowns we faced in Q1. \n With that, I'll turn it over to David Fallon to give a deeper dive into the [indiscernible]. \nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 7. This page provides a summary of our debt structure and our current and expected future liquidity. Starting on the left-hand side, we remind investors that we were able to time the SPAC transaction and debt refinancing quite well with neither likely available to us in this current market environment. However, as a result, we possess a rather simple long-term debt structure with a $2.2 billion term loan maturing in 2027, with $1 billion at a variable rate, currently at 3.4% and $1.2 billion swapped to a fixed rate of 4.1%, resulting in a relatively modest annual cash interest run rate of less than $90 million, which is inclusive of interest on our $455 million asset-based lending facility or our ABL. \n Now counterparties to our ABL are all large, well-known, reputable banks. Hence, we believe there is little counterparty risk related to credit in our ABL. Our term loan contains no financial maintenance covenants, and our ABL contains only one springing financial maintenance covenant if our availability falls below $45.5 million or 10% of the total facility. The springing financial maintenance covenant is a fixed charge coverage ratio that must be greater than 1 and which was at 3.7 at the end of March. Hence, we believe there is minimal risk of violating this covenant even under significant downside scenarios. \n The right-hand side of this page summarizes our liquidity, a strong $446 million at the end of the first quarter including $289 million of nonrestricted cash and $157 million available on our ABL. We will review the components of negative free cash flow in the first quarter in a few slides. But $100 million of that use of cash was pursuant to discrete payments related to the SPAC transaction and cash interest, which will not recur going forward. We continue to expect positive free cash flow for the full year including slightly negative in the second quarter and significantly positive in the third and fourth quarters. This projected quarterly cash flow cadence is consistent with prior years, as we generally use cash in the first quarter and second quarter free cash flow is generally somewhat modest due to lower collections from lighter seasonal first quarter sales. Normally, a large percentage of our full year free cash flow is generated in the second half of the year. \n We feel quite good about our liquidity projections, even under unlikely significant downside scenarios. For example, even if sales are modeled to decline an improbable 25% from last year. And as Dave mentioned at the outset and just for avoidance of doubt, we provide this illustrative downside scenario simply to demonstrate confidence in our liquidity and not as any form of directional guidance. But even under this extreme scenario, our projected liquidity low point in 2020, still does not drop below $300 million, as lower adjusted EBITDA is partially offset by a recovery of working capital, which runs at about 22.5% of sales. \n And for further clarity, this $300 million low point is not a year-end liquidity figure, but this would be projected to occur at some point intra-month in the fourth quarter, as our liquidity ebbs and flows intra-quarter, but is generally highest at each quarter and year-end. In addition, under this and any significant downside sales scenario, our liquidity is also negatively impacted by lower collateral on the ABL as lower sales reduce eligible accounts receivable supporting the borrowing base. Of course, this modeling scenario also assumes that customers continue to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner, and we pay suppliers similarly. \n As of today, we have not experienced any significant collection issues. In addition, our modeling does not assume the benefit of any additional cost actions, which certainly would be likely in a significant sales downturn nor does this scenario include the benefit of any potential additional liquidity actions, including contractually extending supplier payment terms, establishing local lines of credit or even though we do not foresee a dire need at this point, opportunistically accessing debt financing markets. \n Next slide, turning to Slide 8. This page summarizes our first quarter financial results versus last year's first quarter. Net sales were down $158 million or 15%, including approximately $80 million due to COVID-19 and $19 million from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as most global currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar in the first quarter. The remaining $59 million reduction was anticipated heading into the quarter, primarily driven by large projects in last year's first quarter, predominantly in Americas and EMEA. \n Adjusted EBITDA declined $40 million from last year due to the lower top line, and partially offset by lower fixed costs from prior year restructuring activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 260 basis points primarily due to the lower leverage of fixed costs. And to the far right, free cash flow declined $158 million from last year's first quarter, including $100 million combined due to discrete payments pursuant to the SPAC transaction and cash interest that will not recur going forward. We will provide a more fulsome explanation of changes in free cash flow in just a couple of slides. \n Finally, on this slide, we include a note at the bottom explaining that pursuant to our debt refinancing at the beginning of March, where we raised the new term loan and concurrently paid off several high interest rate notes, we recognized $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt. $99 million of this loss was a noncash write-off of deferred financing fees and $75 million was a cash payment for the early redemption of the notes. Neither of these items is included in adjusted EBITDA and the cash payment for early redemption or the $75 million is included in financing activities in the statement cash flow. \n Next, turning to Slide 9. This page summarizes our first quarter segment results. I won't delve into the details, but COVID-19 certainly negatively influenced each of the 3 regions. We disclosed the top line impact for each region on Page 5 of this presentation, including $50 million of the $80 million in APAC, as China was virtually shut down in February. However, excluding the impact of COVID-19 and adjusted for $8 million of foreign exchange, APAC sales actually increased $23 million from last year's first quarter primarily on the strength of telecom and larger colocation and hyperscale customers. Net sales in the other 2 regions were down from prior year, even excluding COVID-19 and foreign exchange primarily driven by several larger projects that shipped in the first quarter of 2019. Lower adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin in each region was primarily driven by lower year-over-year net sales. \n Next, turning to Slide 10. This chart bridges first quarter free cash flow from last year. While we have historically used cash in the first quarter, free cash flow this year was further negatively impacted by lower sales from COVID-19, which significantly contributed to the $41 million increase in inventory and a $40 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. In addition, cash interest in this year's first quarter was actually $33 million higher than last year, as we accelerated accrued interest payments on the notes we paid off pursuant to the debt refinancing. And we were also negatively impacted by the timing of interest payments on the former term loan. \n Of course, on a go-forward basis, our quarterly cash interest will be significantly reduced as reflected by the $79 million run rate adjustment in the green bar farthest to the right. First quarter free cash flow was also negatively impacted by $21 million of discrete costs pursuant to the SPAC transaction. \n So in summary, on a pro forma run rate basis, we used about $103 million of free cash flow in the first quarter with approximately $80 million directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. And despite this negative free cash flow in the first quarter, we still expect significantly positive free cash flow for the full year. \n And with that said, I turn it back over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thanks, David. As we turn to Slide 11, it's important to communicate the fact that our critical digital infrastructure is more necessary now than ever before because of the world's growing need and dependency on vital applications. While we remain cautiously optimistic on the balance of the year, the dynamic nature of the situation makes it extremely difficult to provide guidance at this time. We do feel good about the demand side, and we believe the volatility of this supply chain will moderate over time, but it's not possible at this time to be able to peg a number for 2020. \n What I can share, however, is internally, we have run multiple scenarios, as discussed earlier, and sensitivity analysis. And even in the most aggressive downside case, with sales at $4 billion, we would still be in a position to deliver approximately $500 million in adjusted EBITDA. Clearly, additional cost actions would be taken, which we have, but those actions have been identified and are realistic from a timing and savings standpoint. I provide these numbers as a reference point, but have no reason at this time to believe we will see sales fall this far. We are always preparing for every ever-changing scenario. \n Now turning to Slide 12 and in closing. I want to thank you for your support over the past quarter and in the quarters to come. We participate in a great industry, as Dave said. We have the leadership and position and never has critical digital infrastructure to support the vital applications of the world been so important as it is now. Our order rate, our cost actions we've implemented, our liquidity position are all in great shape as we continue operating during this dynamic time. We will continue to invest, as Dave said, for the future while managing for today. This strategic approach will prepare us to be even more successful when we emerge from this pandemic and the world adapts to a new normal. Thank you again for your support. Stay healthy. \n I now turn the call over to the operator who will open the line up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: Maybe we could start with the cost savings. So the $60 million that you guys are targeting, it seems to me that these are kind of all incremental actions relative to the medium-term margin expansion plan that you've laid out. So maybe you could talk about the temporary versus structural nature of the cost savings. It seems to me like these are all temporary, and they will come back when demand resumes. And maybe the ability to pull some of the medium-term cost items that you guys are working through into 2020 as demand is weak. \nRob Johnson: Yes. So Nicole, this is Rob. What I would tell you is they're not costs that we expect to come back into the business when we return back to work. These are costs, and we'll realize, as I mentioned in my comments, we'll benefit from these actions. Whether they're furloughs, whether they're merit increases, whether it's the discretionary expense decrease. So we fully expect to realize these costs and see them hit the bottom line throughout the quarter. \n We have -- and you are correct, we continue to operate on what we've talked about in the past. The other levers for margin expansion, utilizing the Vertiv operating system as a utilization to increase and better our margin profile and all of the other fixed cost constant things. Everything we've talked about, that's separate to the $60 million. This was really in addition. And as Dave Fallon mentioned, there are additional levers that we can pull if necessary, if we see demand or changes in the environment. David Fallon, any other thoughts? \nDavid Fallon: If I could interject a bit. You are a bit right there, though, Nicole. I mean once volume comes back, yes, people will expect merit increases, we'll return the 401(k), that sort of thing. But as Rob points out, these are very real cost savings this year. So we will get those. And some of those costs only come back if the volume really comes back. And independent of that, I guess, somewhat complementary to it, to Rob's point, we're still working all our plans to keep fixed costs constant as we go forward. So I put all that together and say, this is a smart thing for us to be doing right now and helps us to achieve everything that we've talked about. But at the same time, we want to be prepared for the future. And as volume comes back, which we suspect it's going to, given everything we see in our industry, and we think it's actually going to be pretty darn good, yes, some of that may come back, but it's only going to come back with volume that's in that 45% contribution margin range. \nNicole DeBlase: Got it. That's really helpful. And then can we also maybe dig in a little bit to what you guys are seeing in April? Most companies have been willing to comment on that a little bit just because we don't really have a ton of visibility sitting here with what you guys are seeing in the early stages of this in North America and Europe. Is that something that you're willing to give some color on? \nRob Johnson: Yes. This is Rob. Just at a high level, what I would tell you, we expect throughout Q1, April, to see orders continue in a growth trajectory. And then we expect to see some impact from the COVID and from our ability to deliver. We don't have exact numbers, we really don't know. And again, as we mentioned, we're battling every day all around the world to make sure we can supply, keep our factories open, sub-suppliers. So I would just say that we expect orders to continue to be favorable, and we expect to have some COVID impact as we go through Q2, like most other companies have suggested. \nNicole DeBlase: And when you say favorable, do you mean orders are still up year-on-year versus like -- versus the 1Q order growth? \nRob Johnson: Yes. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Was just hoping the company could discuss the demand environment, both in terms of how the first quarter closed and if any business slipped out compared to what the company had been expecting when it held its last earnings call in March. But maybe more importantly, given the record backlog and based on what management knows today, is Vertiv still expecting a pickup in 2H '20 sales compared to 1H '20 on a qualitative basis? \nRob Johnson: Mark, Rob here again. A couple of comments there. We did see -- to answer your first question, we did see some pushouts, basically access to sites happen, in the combination of not being able to fulfill orders or pushouts because of site access or areas being shut down, for example, like Singapore today is. We do expect, and this has been consistent with what we've talked about since the beginning, that the second half would be an upside for us. Now again, given COVID, no one can predict how long the thing will last and when every country will be back to work. But the expectations are that the second half will be an up path as we said in the past. \nMark Delaney: Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question, I just wanted to better understand one of the comments in the press release. I think the company talked about a stable demand environment, but also orders were up 13% year-over-year. So I'm just trying to better reconcile some of the commentary, some of the puts and takes in orders that the company is seeing and just kind of better understand stable relative to the order growth that was reported. \nRob Johnson: Yes. Mark, just going through that at a high level, but hopefully give you enough color here. As we had been talking about, and I think in our last conference call, we talked about the fact that there was this digestion going on in the U.S. and we would expect in Q1 to begin to see orders pick up, specifically in the colo and hyperscale space. We saw real strength in the colo, hyperscale and telecommunications. And so that drove a lot of that, and that was what we had expected and it had happened. \n I think there were some orders. People had placed orders in advance to get in line because they want to make sure they're going to get their product. The areas which you would expect, small to medium business and enterprise during these times and the channel type business would be -- would not be on a growth trajectory right now. But again, with the products we're releasing, with our focus on that market, we fully expect when people get back to work, that we'll have recovery there. \nMark Delaney: Okay. And then just lastly, a follow-up on the questions related to cost and SG&A dollars were a fair amount less than what I had been anticipating, and how they talked about some of those incremental savings still to come. So maybe just help us understand how to think about SG&A dollars in 2Q and throughout the year? And do those trend lower than the levels that were reported in the first quarter? Or again, some of the temporary actions that I realize will be achieved -- do some of those temporary costs start to come back in, and so OpEx dollars start to go back up compared to where we came in at for the first quarter. \nRob Johnson: Yes. I have a couple of comments. This is Rob again, and then I'll turn it over to Dave or David. But what I would tell you is the world is going to be, I think, different. I don't -- can't predict actually even what it's going to look like. But I think we've learned to do work in a different way, which could affect some of our discretionary expenses, whether it's travel, the T&E side of things. \n So I would fully expect that -- and our team is working on new ways of doing work that are more efficient and more effective. And to give you an example, during this time, training for our sales -- for our service people, traditionally is something where we fly them in, they sit in class, and it's expensive. We've been able to do and use tools online, online testing, online classes. So we'll continue to take the efficiencies and the things we've learned during this pandemic and apply those to drive more efficiency going forward. David Fallon? \nDavid Fallon: Sure. And just some further detail on that $60 million, probably about 70% of that will impact SG&A. So a good portion of the cost actions that we put in place will benefit SG&A going forward. And I think some of the drivers of the lower year-over-year SG&A in 1Q versus the first quarter last year will continue going forward. We were able to put in place some restructuring activity last year, which we will benefit from in each quarter going forward. \n So we certainly have some tailwinds behind us as it relates to SG&A. But also reminding folks that we are continuing to invest in innovation and technology and specifically R&D, even through some of the top line issues. And that R&D will be rolling through SG&A. So even though if you look year-over-year, we do not anticipate a significant increase in SG&A because we believe we can offset some of the higher cost of R&D with some of these favorable SG&A trends. We wouldn't necessarily expect significant reductions going forward. \nOperator: Next question comes from Lance Vitanza of Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: I wanted to actually focus on Slide 5. I found that very helpful. And I'll start. I was surprised to see the demand impact so significant. I mean 40% of the $80 million of revenues, so roughly $30 million. And I'm just trying to figure out how does that square with the commentary around orders being up year-over-year across the board. And specifically, does demand in this context, does this here include the inability to access customer locations? Or when you refer to demand, are you really specifically referring to just customers saying, we no longer want what we thought we wanted? \nRob Johnson: This is Rob again. Few comments on that, and then I'll hand it over to David. What I'd say is what we haven't seen is, customer demand, someone place an order and then cancel that. We have not seen canceled orders. So what we have seen, as you mentioned, and you're direct on is that the access to the site are people actually pushing it out just because they're shut down, and we can't access that site. So the combination of not being able to manufacture the goods because of the things that are happening in our manufacturing facilities and the access to sites really drove that revenue, that $80 million COVID impact. \nLance Vitanza: Okay. That's super helpful and kind of what I expected, but wasn't clear. So then to the extent that this revenue is deferred rather than lost. Obviously, nobody knows when the lockdown ends. But once the lockdown does end, how quickly would you think, all else equal, we expect to see that deferred revenue return? I mean I would think it would be pretty quick, meaning in within a couple of months from whenever the lockdowns are over. Is that a fair estimation? \nRob Johnson: I wouldn't say within a couple of months, only because I don't know when our factories and rest of the supply chain will be at full strength and full health. That's going to be dependent, but access to sites will open up, and we'll certainly have a large backlog to work through and get that out. So I would expect to see, as we've talked about, and again, even pre-COVID that the second half will have a nice jump into it. And I think based on what we've seen in the backlog and customer overall demand, we're not seeing people cancel or delay. \n Now I did mention, and we did talk about the channel, things with small to medium business, who knows how these are going to come back. And various verticals, whether it's entertainment or whether it's travel. Some of those have been impacted pretty hard. And I just can't predict how that's going to come back, but we do see other areas like health care. And the thing I'm so excited about is this work-from-home initiative is really driving the fact that we need more edge devices. Latency has become a real huge issue. I bet every one of you experienced that in your home. So overall, we see the world coming back and our stuff being more -- even more vital than what it was prior to COVID. \nLance Vitanza: Understood. Maybe just 2 quick follow-ups on that. The first is, could you remind us what percentage of your revenue currently comes from the channel? \n And then secondly, the EBITDA impact that you saw from the COVID hit in the first quarter is about 35%, 40% flow through. Is that -- whatever the revenue impact turns out to be in the second quarter, we don't know. But whatever that revenue impact is, should we expect the same kind of flow through to EBITDA that we saw in the first quarter? \nRob Johnson: Sure. I'll handle that. Yes, I'll handle the first part and then turn it over to David. On the channel side, that represents about 15% of our overall global revenue, so it's around $600 million, $700 million. David Fallon, on the margin side or flow through? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So we applied a 40% contribution margin to the $80 million COVID sales impact. And the reason we use a number that is probably a little bit lower than what we have been broadcasting as our contribution margin is because $50 million of that $80 million was in APAC. And in general, our contribution margins in APAC are lower than the other 2 regions. For the sake of modeling, going forward, we would anticipate any lost sales impact, whether it's related to COVID or otherwise, to be somewhere between the 40% and 45%. So probably a little bit higher than what we used in the first quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Is there any impact on price in the quarter? Is price generally pretty flattish at this point? Or are you able to get any positive price, particularly with new products? \nRob Johnson: Yes. So great question. And I would say within the quarter, we did -- we were able to get some price. We have actions, ongoing actions we did last year and will continue this year to drive price in areas. New products being delivered to the market give us some unique features and give us a little bit of pricing power as well. So the combination of just being maniacally focused on pricing on a global basis and new products intros that have innovative features that allow us to get more price than our competitors. For example, new models of our DSE air conditioner that allow higher margins for us. So we've been still able to get price during this time in various areas. We're very focused on that. \nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then I probably should have asked this question a while ago, but how much of your backlog has a down payment? What's kind of the standard in putting something into backlog, which, obviously, the confidence in that backlog? Love to get your opinion on that as well. But first question really relating to how much of that requires a down payment? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Scott, not much at all. Very little do we have prepayment cash upfront on that. Now the backlog is supported by very healthy companies. Those orders that are coming in, whether it's colo, hyperscale, telecom, although all companies are affected by this pandemic, we have a really solid base of very financially stable companies that have placed these orders, and we feel real confident that we won't be seeing canceled orders. The demand is high as you can [indiscernible]. \nScott Davis: Okay. And just on... \nDavid Cote: The other thing that... \nScott Davis: Please go right ahead, sorry. \nDavid Cote: Yes, Scott, the other thing that I'd add is just right now, this is a tremendous proof point that data centers are important, not just now, but going forward. And it's hard to imagine that these orders don't get -- don't continue. And to Rob's point, historically, we've had -- the backlog tends to be pretty robust. \nScott Davis: Anyways, to get back to brass tacks here. A couple of just cleanups, and hopefully, you don't have a lot of other questions just cut me off if you do. But am I to assume that if 70% of that $60 million is SG&A, then the other 30% is kind of at the factory level and perhaps some of that could be structural/permanent? Is that possible or... \nDavid Fallon: Scott, this is David Fallon. Absolutely. So if you look at the large components of the $60 million, probably 1/3 of that is discretionary spending. And that is more than likely the bucket of costs that we would be targeting going forward to be a permanent reduction. So a portion of that is D&E as an example. And we're all kind of learning new ways to do business without jumping on a plane. And so if you look at the different components, I would say there's going to be something of that $60 million that certainly flows through into next year and going forward. And we look at -- one thing -- one philosophy that Dave Cote has brought to us is a fixed cost is a fixed cost, whether it's in the factories or in the office. And we treat all fixed costs the same, and certainly, a significant portion of this will be benefiting the factories as well. \nScott Davis: Okay. Super. I'm sorry, I have one last final one. Inventories, the -- was it the shutdown in the middle of March that kind of caught you guys with your pants down, if you will, on inventories because that was a pretty meaningful buildup that we saw? And presumably, you saw issues, I would imagine, in China, particularly earlier in the quarter that -- and so I was a little surprised the inventory is built that much. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So absolutely, the -- the negative impact from COVID, and we -- as we got through the first quarter, we were actually in line with our internal projections as it relates to the top line. And things moved south really quickly in China, virtually shut down all of February. And then, of course, the impact in the other regions accelerated into March. So as we were putting our inventory build plans together as of early February, we didn't necessarily anticipate the size of the negative impact that actually occurred. So I would attribute a very large portion of that $40 million, if not all, just related to our sales planning projections based on where we were sitting at the end of January. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: So I thought one of the highlights of the quarter was services growth remained in place. And I'm just curious how the short-term placed restrictions have impacted services. And then on top of that, maybe just characterize the service book in terms of transactional or discretionary services versus contractual? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Nigel, thanks for the question and your time here. Yes, the services, one of the areas of growth is if you look at and recall when we kind of on the road and going through is services and the channel IT. So service has been a real focus for us to expand that, get higher capture rates and so forth. So we expected to see growth there. Where we were able to get access, we do have about 55%, 60% of our services are under contract and whether the preventive maintenance and so on. And we've seen some pushback on preventive maintenance and people going to more critical services necessary during this time or what we call start-up services. \n So we did see an uptick in the actual services, but we did see a downtick a little bit in the spare parts side of things. So the combination of the 2 kind of led us to a little bit of growth there. We expect coming out of this, especially, Dave mentioned, things are so vital now, customers really want to make sure they get their health checks on their systems and so on. So I would expect and we'll continue to invest in service people, service personnel to make sure that these networks remain vital and robust. \nNigel Coe: Right. Yes, that makes sense. And then I thought the free cash flow scenario analysis was very, very helpful. And given that the down 25% isn't your -- clearly isn't your [ base ] case scenario, but in that scenario, are you assuming that working capital can delever at the same rate of sales, so that 20% remains fairly constant on sales by year-end? And then I think you called out, David, that the 2Q free cash flow could be negative. Is that normal seasonality for free cash flow? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Just to address the second one. Absolutely. If you look at the cadence of our quarterly free cash flow, our first quarter historically has been negative. And our second quarter toggles between slightly positive or slightly negative. Certainly, free cash flow in Q2 will be impacted by the lower sales in Q1. So we are anticipating a slight use of cash in Q2 this year. \n And as it relates to the recovery of working capital, the way we are modeling and actuals hold true to this if we look at our historical movement in working capital. But we're assuming a 22.5% recovery in working capital per dollar of sales, whether that goes up or down. And if you compare that to the 42.5% or so contribution margin on sales, for every dollar of sales loss, we lose about $0.20 of free cash flow. And that $0.20 is 42.5% contribution margin less than -- or less the 22.5% for working capital. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Rob Johnson for any closing remarks. \nRob Johnson: Thank you, operator, and thank you all of you for those questions. As Dave stated in the beginning, we are investing for the future during this COVID period in R&D and in sales, people and services. We'll continue to do that, so we come out much stronger. We're taking the appropriate actions on cost, and we have additional levers, if necessary, if this pandemic gets worse. We're continuing to drive the long-term margin expansion that we've talked about, and we'll continue to pull those 4 or 5 levers. \n And I want everyone to be clear, as we've mentioned many times, we feel we have solid liquidity. I want to thank all 19,000-plus employees around the world for working hard every day to take care of our customers. We appreciate all your time. Please stay safe. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you very much. This concludes the call. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 7. This page provides a summary of our debt structure and our current and expected future liquidity. Starting on the left-hand side, we remind investors that we were able to time the SPAC transaction and debt refinancing quite well with neither likely available to us in this current market environment. However, as a result, we possess a rather simple long-term debt structure with a $2.2 billion term loan maturing in 2027, with $1 billion at a variable rate, currently at 3.4% and $1.2 billion swapped to a fixed rate of 4.1%, resulting in a relatively modest annual cash interest run rate of less than $90 million, which is inclusive of interest on our $455 million asset-based lending facility or our ABL. \n Now counterparties to our ABL are all large, well-known, reputable banks. Hence, we believe there is little counterparty risk related to credit in our ABL. Our term loan contains no financial maintenance covenants, and our ABL contains only one springing financial maintenance covenant if our availability falls below $45.5 million or 10% of the total facility. The springing financial maintenance covenant is a fixed charge coverage ratio that must be greater than 1 and which was at 3.7 at the end of March. Hence, we believe there is minimal risk of violating this covenant even under significant downside scenarios. \n The right-hand side of this page summarizes our liquidity, a strong $446 million at the end of the first quarter including $289 million of nonrestricted cash and $157 million available on our ABL. We will review the components of negative free cash flow in the first quarter in a few slides. But $100 million of that use of cash was pursuant to discrete payments related to the SPAC transaction and cash interest, which will not recur going forward. We continue to expect positive free cash flow for the full year including slightly negative in the second quarter and significantly positive in the third and fourth quarters. This projected quarterly cash flow cadence is consistent with prior years, as we generally use cash in the first quarter and second quarter free cash flow is generally somewhat modest due to lower collections from lighter seasonal first quarter sales. Normally, a large percentage of our full year free cash flow is generated in the second half of the year. \n We feel quite good about our liquidity projections, even under unlikely significant downside scenarios. For example, even if sales are modeled to decline an improbable 25% from last year. And as Dave mentioned at the outset and just for avoidance of doubt, we provide this illustrative downside scenario simply to demonstrate confidence in our liquidity and not as any form of directional guidance. But even under this extreme scenario, our projected liquidity low point in 2020, still does not drop below $300 million, as lower adjusted EBITDA is partially offset by a recovery of working capital, which runs at about 22.5% of sales. \n And for further clarity, this $300 million low point is not a year-end liquidity figure, but this would be projected to occur at some point intra-month in the fourth quarter, as our liquidity ebbs and flows intra-quarter, but is generally highest at each quarter and year-end. In addition, under this and any significant downside sales scenario, our liquidity is also negatively impacted by lower collateral on the ABL as lower sales reduce eligible accounts receivable supporting the borrowing base. Of course, this modeling scenario also assumes that customers continue to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner, and we pay suppliers similarly. \n As of today, we have not experienced any significant collection issues. In addition, our modeling does not assume the benefit of any additional cost actions, which certainly would be likely in a significant sales downturn nor does this scenario include the benefit of any potential additional liquidity actions, including contractually extending supplier payment terms, establishing local lines of credit or even though we do not foresee a dire need at this point, opportunistically accessing debt financing markets. \n Next slide, turning to Slide 8. This page summarizes our first quarter financial results versus last year's first quarter. Net sales were down $158 million or 15%, including approximately $80 million due to COVID-19 and $19 million from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as most global currencies weakened versus the U.S. dollar in the first quarter. The remaining $59 million reduction was anticipated heading into the quarter, primarily driven by large projects in last year's first quarter, predominantly in Americas and EMEA. \n Adjusted EBITDA declined $40 million from last year due to the lower top line, and partially offset by lower fixed costs from prior year restructuring activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined 260 basis points primarily due to the lower leverage of fixed costs. And to the far right, free cash flow declined $158 million from last year's first quarter, including $100 million combined due to discrete payments pursuant to the SPAC transaction and cash interest that will not recur going forward. We will provide a more fulsome explanation of changes in free cash flow in just a couple of slides. \n Finally, on this slide, we include a note at the bottom explaining that pursuant to our debt refinancing at the beginning of March, where we raised the new term loan and concurrently paid off several high interest rate notes, we recognized $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt. $99 million of this loss was a noncash write-off of deferred financing fees and $75 million was a cash payment for the early redemption of the notes. Neither of these items is included in adjusted EBITDA and the cash payment for early redemption or the $75 million is included in financing activities in the statement cash flow. \n Next, turning to Slide 9. This page summarizes our first quarter segment results. I won't delve into the details, but COVID-19 certainly negatively influenced each of the 3 regions. We disclosed the top line impact for each region on Page 5 of this presentation, including $50 million of the $80 million in APAC, as China was virtually shut down in February. However, excluding the impact of COVID-19 and adjusted for $8 million of foreign exchange, APAC sales actually increased $23 million from last year's first quarter primarily on the strength of telecom and larger colocation and hyperscale customers. Net sales in the other 2 regions were down from prior year, even excluding COVID-19 and foreign exchange primarily driven by several larger projects that shipped in the first quarter of 2019. Lower adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA margin in each region was primarily driven by lower year-over-year net sales. \n Next, turning to Slide 10. This chart bridges first quarter free cash flow from last year. While we have historically used cash in the first quarter, free cash flow this year was further negatively impacted by lower sales from COVID-19, which significantly contributed to the $41 million increase in inventory and a $40 million reduction in adjusted EBITDA. In addition, cash interest in this year's first quarter was actually $33 million higher than last year, as we accelerated accrued interest payments on the notes we paid off pursuant to the debt refinancing. And we were also negatively impacted by the timing of interest payments on the former term loan. \n Of course, on a go-forward basis, our quarterly cash interest will be significantly reduced as reflected by the $79 million run rate adjustment in the green bar farthest to the right. First quarter free cash flow was also negatively impacted by $21 million of discrete costs pursuant to the SPAC transaction. \n So in summary, on a pro forma run rate basis, we used about $103 million of free cash flow in the first quarter with approximately $80 million directly or indirectly attributable to COVID-19. And despite this negative free cash flow in the first quarter, we still expect significantly positive free cash flow for the full year. \n And with that said, I turn it back over to Rob. If I could interject a bit. You are a bit right there, though, Nicole. I mean once volume comes back, yes, people will expect merit increases, we'll return the 401(k), that sort of thing. But as Rob points out, these are very real cost savings this year. So we will get those. And some of those costs only come back if the volume really comes back. And independent of that, I guess, somewhat complementary to it, to Rob's point, we're still working all our plans to keep fixed costs constant as we go forward. So I put all that together and say, this is a smart thing for us to be doing right now and helps us to achieve everything that we've talked about. But at the same time, we want to be prepared for the future. And as volume comes back, which we suspect it's going to, given everything we see in our industry, and we think it's actually going to be pretty darn good, yes, some of that may come back, but it's only going to come back with volume that's in that 45% contribution margin range. Sure. And just some further detail on that $60 million, probably about 70% of that will impact SG&A. So a good portion of the cost actions that we put in place will benefit SG&A going forward. And I think some of the drivers of the lower year-over-year SG&A in 1Q versus the first quarter last year will continue going forward. We were able to put in place some restructuring activity last year, which we will benefit from in each quarter going forward. \n So we certainly have some tailwinds behind us as it relates to SG&A. But also reminding folks that we are continuing to invest in innovation and technology and specifically R&D, even through some of the top line issues. And that R&D will be rolling through SG&A. So even though if you look year-over-year, we do not anticipate a significant increase in SG&A because we believe we can offset some of the higher cost of R&D with some of these favorable SG&A trends. We wouldn't necessarily expect significant reductions going forward. Yes. So we applied a 40% contribution margin to the $80 million COVID sales impact. And the reason we use a number that is probably a little bit lower than what we have been broadcasting as our contribution margin is because $50 million of that $80 million was in APAC. And in general, our contribution margins in APAC are lower than the other 2 regions. For the sake of modeling, going forward, we would anticipate any lost sales impact, whether it's related to COVID or otherwise, to be somewhere between the 40% and 45%. So probably a little bit higher than what we used in the first quarter. Scott, this is David Fallon. Absolutely. So if you look at the large components of the $60 million, probably 1/3 of that is discretionary spending. And that is more than likely the bucket of costs that we would be targeting going forward to be a permanent reduction. So a portion of that is D&E as an example. And we're all kind of learning new ways to do business without jumping on a plane. And so if you look at the different components, I would say there's going to be something of that $60 million that certainly flows through into next year and going forward.

So I would attribute a very large portion of that $40 million, if not all, just related to our sales planning projections based on where we were sitting at the end of January. Yes. Just to address the second one. Absolutely. If you look at the cadence of our quarterly free cash flow, our first quarter historically has been negative. And our second quarter toggles between slightly positive or slightly negative. Certainly, free cash flow in Q2 will be impacted by the lower sales in Q1. So we are anticipating a slight use of cash in Q2 this year. \n And as it relates to the recovery of working capital, the way we are modeling and actuals hold true to this if we look at our historical movement in working capital. But we're assuming a 22.5% recovery in working capital per dollar of sales, whether that goes up or down. And if you compare that to the 42.5% or so contribution margin on sales, for every dollar of sales loss, we lose about $0.20 of free cash flow. And that $0.20 is 42.5% contribution margin less than -- or less the 22.5% for working capital."

            "name": "Rob Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and welcome, everyone, today. As I said on the last call, I really value the advice that Dave has provided to the team since he's been engaged with Vertiv. And I especially appreciate his counsel now as we navigate through these pandemic times. Before I walk you through the slide, it goes without saying that we have been proactive in protecting the safety of our employees and our customers. We've implemented precautionary measures from temperature screening to increased cleaning and disinfecting of facilities to social distancing at work, just to name a few. Additionally, our service technicians have followed Vertiv's safety protocols and adhered to additional safety measures adopted at customer sites. \n Safety of our Vertiv employees and our customers has been and will continue to be at the forefront of everything we do. I want to thank the Vertiv employees for their hard work during Q1 and give a shout out to the manufacturing workers and the service technicians who continue to provide products and services to our customers and conduct day-to-day business with the utmost of caution amidst COVID-19. I appreciate their steadfast commitment to Vertiv. It's their unwavering dedication that has allowed us to serve our customers, enable those customers to provide technology and vital applications to the world that they rely on more than ever. To all of our employees on the front line, I say thank you. \n Let's take a look at the slides, starting with Slide 4. Overall, the demand side of our business was very robust in Q1 as orders were up 13% compared to the first quarter of 2019. We exited Q1 with a record high backlog of $1.6 billion, which can be attributed to cloud, colocation and telecom customers around the world who are delivering vital applications so students could be educated online, hospitals and health care facilities could function, workers could work from home and businesses experiencing a surge in demand during the stay-at-home mandate could deliver. \n On the revenue side, despite almost all of our manufacturing facilities being up and running, we have been deemed essential. We were still adversely impacted by COVID as many of our facilities are still dealing with some level of disruption. Additionally, Q1 of 2019 had a few large projects complete, which made a difficult comparison. In Q1, we proactively implemented cost actions to protect the business having seen and felt the impact of COVID in China before things spread to other parts of the world. These cost actions are expected to generate $60 million of benefit by the end of the year. David will address liquidity later, but we feel good about our position today and know that even under a variety of downside scenarios that Dave spoke to, we will be able to maintain our strong liquidity base. \n [ We stay close ] to our customers and continually monitor and comply with directives of governments around the world as they relate to pandemic actions. This pandemic has put us and others in a position where things will remain dynamic and unpredictable over the next several months. Because of this, we are withdrawing our previous guidance. I can tell you this, however, Vertiv has been designated as an essential business. We see strong demand for our products and services. We are taking short-term and long-term actions to make sure we continue to serve our customers. We are nimble, flexible and responsive. We are ready to adapt, react and serve in ways that will be needed for today and tomorrow and in the future. \n Turning to Slide 5. There's a lot of content on this slide, so I won't hit every bullet. But we wanted to provide you with additional knowledge and deeper insight about our business. The first quarter COVID impact of $80 million was roughly 60% supply-based and 40% demand-based. On the supply side, I'm proud to tell you that all of our facilities, with the exception of a small plant in China, are back up and running. Now not all of our facilities are running at 100% because there are still many things they are struggling with: parts issues, logistics constraints, but nonetheless, we are able to operate at some level in every region. \n The supply side is aggressively being monitored on a daily basis as issues arise. Whether it's government health inspections, supplier output, logistics and many more, there's just a myriad of obstacles that our team has to continue to overcome on a daily basis. The Vertiv team has done an outstanding job to carefully and methodically resolve these issues as they arise in places all over the globe, so we continue to supply products to our customers and assist them with their services needs. \n Moving on to the demand side. Certainly, the headline number of orders being up 13% is great accomplishment of the sales and marketing team. Each region grew orders substantially with EMEA leading the way at 26% year-over-year growth in Q1. The orders were largely driven by cloud, large colocation and telecommunication companies. The area where we saw softness was within the small- and medium-sized business that is served by our IT channel partners who have been adversely affected by the pandemic. As this segment of the business starts to come back, we expect to see demand continue. \n Turning to Slide 6. As I mentioned previously, we were in early identifying, addressing and implementing a number of different cost actions for Q1. The entire leadership team and Board of Directors took a 10% base pay cut. While this may not be new news to most of you, what you didn't know is that they volunteered to do this. I didn't even have to ask them. \n Additionally, merit increases for employees were halted for 2020. The 401(k) match in the U.S. has been stopped, and every department has been tasked with a discretionary 15% cut. Furthermore, Dave mentioned in his opening remarks about use of furloughs, and we have implemented those across every function and every jurisdiction where it's allowed. Employees have been understanding and supportive of our efforts to utilize these measures to make sure Vertiv stays strong and financially healthy. These actions and a few others will contribute to $60 million of P&L benefit during the rest of 2020. \n We are also being aggressive on the revenue side. Our sales and service teams are strengthening ties with the customer, providing updates and reassurances to them regularly. We have enhanced our marketing message and increased our social media presence as we look for additional ways to reach those in need of the products and services that we provide. The selfless nature of our 19,000-plus employees is a testament to the culture of the organization. Our desire to be present and helpful to those who need us, our willingness to work while we battle COVID-19, I am proud of the way Vertiv and its team have acted and reacted to all the unknowns we faced in Q1. \n With that, I'll turn it over to David Fallon to give a deeper dive into the [indiscernible]. Thanks, David. As we turn to Slide 11, it's important to communicate the fact that our critical digital infrastructure is more necessary now than ever before because of the world's growing need and dependency on vital applications. While we remain cautiously optimistic on the balance of the year, the dynamic nature of the situation makes it extremely difficult to provide guidance at this time. We do feel good about the demand side, and we believe the volatility of this supply chain will moderate over time, but it's not possible at this time to be able to peg a number for 2020. \n What I can share, however, is internally, we have run multiple scenarios, as discussed earlier, and sensitivity analysis. And even in the most aggressive downside case, with sales at $4 billion, we would still be in a position to deliver approximately $500 million in adjusted EBITDA. Clearly, additional cost actions would be taken, which we have, but those actions have been identified and are realistic from a timing and savings standpoint. I provide these numbers as a reference point, but have no reason at this time to believe we will see sales fall this far. We are always preparing for every ever-changing scenario. \n Now turning to Slide 12 and in closing. I want to thank you for your support over the past quarter and in the quarters to come. We participate in a great industry, as Dave said. We have the leadership and position and never has critical digital infrastructure to support the vital applications of the world been so important as it is now. Our order rate, our cost actions we've implemented, our liquidity position are all in great shape as we continue operating during this dynamic time. We will continue to invest, as Dave said, for the future while managing for today. This strategic approach will prepare us to be even more successful when we emerge from this pandemic and the world adapts to a new normal. Thank you again for your support. Stay healthy. \n I now turn the call over to the operator who will open the line up for questions. Yes. So Nicole, this is Rob. What I would tell you is they're not costs that we expect to come back into the business when we return back to work. These are costs, and we'll realize, as I mentioned in my comments, we'll benefit from these actions. Whether they're furloughs, whether they're merit increases, whether it's the discretionary expense decrease. So we fully expect to realize these costs and see them hit the bottom line throughout the quarter. \n We have -- and you are correct, we continue to operate on what we've talked about in the past. The other levers for margin expansion, utilizing the Vertiv operating system as a utilization to increase and better our margin profile and all of the other fixed cost constant things. Everything we've talked about, that's separate to the $60 million. This was really in addition. And as Dave Fallon mentioned, there are additional levers that we can pull if necessary, if we see demand or changes in the environment. David Fallon, any other thoughts? Yes. This is Rob. Just at a high level, what I would tell you, we expect throughout Q1, April, to see orders continue in a growth trajectory. And then we expect to see some impact from the COVID and from our ability to deliver. We don't have exact numbers, we really don't know. And again, as we mentioned, we're battling every day all around the world to make sure we can supply, keep our factories open, sub-suppliers. So I would just say that we expect orders to continue to be favorable, and we expect to have some COVID impact as we go through Q2, like most other companies have suggested. Yes. Mark, Rob here again. A couple of comments there. We did see -- to answer your first question, we did see some pushouts, basically access to sites happen, in the combination of not being able to fulfill orders or pushouts because of site access or areas being shut down, for example, like Singapore today is. We do expect, and this has been consistent with what we've talked about since the beginning, that the second half would be an upside for us. Now again, given COVID, no one can predict how long the thing will last and when every country will be back to work. But the expectations are that the second half will be an up path as we said in the past. Yes. Mark, just going through that at a high level, but hopefully give you enough color here. As we had been talking about, and I think in our last conference call, we talked about the fact that there was this digestion going on in the U.S. and we would expect in Q1 to begin to see orders pick up, specifically in the colo and hyperscale space. We saw real strength in the colo, hyperscale and telecommunications. And so that drove a lot of that, and that was what we had expected and it had happened. \n I think there were some orders. People had placed orders in advance to get in line because they want to make sure they're going to get their product. The areas which you would expect, small to medium business and enterprise during these times and the channel type business would be -- would not be on a growth trajectory right now. But again, with the products we're releasing, with our focus on that market, we fully expect when people get back to work, that we'll have recovery there. Yes. I have a couple of comments. This is Rob again, and then I'll turn it over to Dave or David. But what I would tell you is the world is going to be, I think, different. I don't -- can't predict actually even what it's going to look like. But I think we've learned to do work in a different way, which could affect some of our discretionary expenses, whether it's travel, the T&E side of things. \n So I would fully expect that -- and our team is working on new ways of doing work that are more efficient and more effective. And to give you an example, during this time, training for our sales -- for our service people, traditionally is something where we fly them in, they sit in class, and it's expensive. We've been able to do and use tools online, online testing, online classes. So we'll continue to take the efficiencies and the things we've learned during this pandemic and apply those to drive more efficiency going forward. David Fallon? This is Rob again. Few comments on that, and then I'll hand it over to David. What I'd say is what we haven't seen is, customer demand, someone place an order and then cancel that. We have not seen canceled orders. So what we have seen, as you mentioned, and you're direct on is that the access to the site are people actually pushing it out just because they're shut down, and we can't access that site. So the combination of not being able to manufacture the goods because of the things that are happening in our manufacturing facilities and the access to sites really drove that revenue, that $80 million COVID impact. I wouldn't say within a couple of months, only because I don't know when our factories and rest of the supply chain will be at full strength and full health. That's going to be dependent, but access to sites will open up, and we'll certainly have a large backlog to work through and get that out. So I would expect to see, as we've talked about, and again, even pre-COVID that the second half will have a nice jump into it. And I think based on what we've seen in the backlog and customer overall demand, we're not seeing people cancel or delay. \n Now I did mention, and we did talk about the channel, things with small to medium business, who knows how these are going to come back. And various verticals, whether it's entertainment or whether it's travel. Some of those have been impacted pretty hard. And I just can't predict how that's going to come back, but we do see other areas like health care. And the thing I'm so excited about is this work-from-home initiative is really driving the fact that we need more edge devices. Latency has become a real huge issue. I bet every one of you experienced that in your home. So overall, we see the world coming back and our stuff being more -- even more vital than what it was prior to COVID. Sure. I'll handle that. Yes, I'll handle the first part and then turn it over to David. On the channel side, that represents about 15% of our overall global revenue, so it's around $600 million, $700 million. David Fallon, on the margin side or flow through? Yes. So great question. And I would say within the quarter, we did -- we were able to get some price. We have actions, ongoing actions we did last year and will continue this year to drive price in areas. New products being delivered to the market give us some unique features and give us a little bit of pricing power as well. So the combination of just being maniacally focused on pricing on a global basis and new products intros that have innovative features that allow us to get more price than our competitors. For example, new models of our DSE air conditioner that allow higher margins for us. So we've been still able to get price during this time in various areas. We're very focused on that. Yes. Scott, not much at all. Very little do we have prepayment cash upfront on that. Now the backlog is supported by very healthy companies. Those orders that are coming in, whether it's colo, hyperscale, telecom, although all companies are affected by this pandemic, we have a really solid base of very financially stable companies that have placed these orders, and we feel real confident that we won't be seeing canceled orders. The demand is high as you can [indiscernible]. Yes. Nigel, thanks for the question and your time here. Yes, the services, one of the areas of growth is if you look at and recall when we kind of on the road and going through is services and the channel IT. So service has been a real focus for us to expand that, get higher capture rates and so forth. So we expected to see growth there. Where we were able to get access, we do have about 55%, 60% of our services are under contract and whether the preventive maintenance and so on. And we've seen some pushback on preventive maintenance and people going to more critical services necessary during this time or what we call start-up services. \n So we did see an uptick in the actual services, but we did see a downtick a little bit in the spare parts side of things. So the combination of the 2 kind of led us to a little bit of growth there. We expect coming out of this, especially, Dave mentioned, things are so vital now, customers really want to make sure they get their health checks on their systems and so on. So I would expect and we'll continue to invest in service people, service personnel to make sure that these networks remain vital and robust. Thank you, operator, and thank you all of you for those questions. As Dave stated in the beginning, we are investing for the future during this COVID period in R&D and in sales, people and services. We'll continue to do that, so we come out much stronger. We're taking the appropriate actions on cost, and we have additional levers, if necessary, if this pandemic gets worse. We're continuing to drive the long-term margin expansion that we've talked about, and we'll continue to pull those 4 or 5 levers. \n And I want everyone to be clear, as we've mentioned many times, we feel we have solid liquidity. I want to thank all 19,000-plus employees around the world for working hard every day to take care of our customers. We appreciate all your time. Please stay safe. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you very much. This concludes the call."

            "name": "David Cote",
            "content": "Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I want to welcome you to the Vertiv investor call to announce our Q1 2020 results. Before I turn it over to Rob Johnson, I want to begin with a few opening remarks. As we spoke last time, and as many of you know, I was fortunate to be able to work for Honeywell for about 16 years. Those who invested with us made a great return. That performance was marked by consistent annual improvements in the people, processes and portfolio of the businesses that made up Honeywell. We did all the seed planting for new products, services, process improvement and other growth initiatives needed to perform well for a long time. \n The world is in a very different place than when we spoke a couple of months ago. But those opening remarks stay true, whether we are in a period of economic expansion or economic contraction. If you look at our success at Honeywell, it really took off after the Great Recession. And I attribute that success largely to the fact that we continue to implement an operating system, we drove technology investments, and we planted seeds even during that difficult time. \n Why do I bring it up? Because we're doing that same kind of seed planting at Vertiv. Now some of you may conflate our withdrawal of guidance even in the face of good orders growth, with the liquidity scenarios we've included, and conclude we see a serious problem looming. That would be an error. They are 2 entirely separate points. We've withdrawn guidance because we can't be sure we can ship given government shutdown of facilities for us and suppliers at various times. Additionally, our service people sometimes aren't allowed access to facilities. Our credibility matters greatly to us. And we don't want to guide to numbers we may not be able to deliver even in the face of strong orders. \n Totally separately, we have included a couple of liquidity scenarios to demonstrate that even if sales fell to $4 billion or even in a 25% sales decline, we will be just fine. It's not a forecast, it's an attempt to make you feel comfortable that we're just fine. Combining these 2 separate points, into the erroneous conclusion that we are forecasting disaster is, well, erroneous. This time has been difficult for everyone. But it also has demonstrated how important data centers and the edge are to our society. It is clearly critical infrastructure and reaffirmation this is a good industry. We have a great position in that good industry. And even at this difficult time, we are investing in the future. Based on how we're running the business during extraordinarily difficult times, including our own customer focus while still seed planting, I am just as excited today as I was 3 months ago about our future. \n Now I'll turn over the call to Rob who can take you through the business in a little more detail. Rob? The other thing that... Yes, Scott, the other thing that I'd add is just right now, this is a tremendous proof point that data centers are important, not just now, but going forward. And it's hard to imagine that these orders don't get -- don't continue. And to Rob's point, historically, we've had -- the backlog tends to be pretty robust."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Matt and I will be your conference Operator today. At this time. I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Matt. And good morning. And welcome to Vertiv\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Burton Executive Chairman David Cote, Chief Executive Officer Rob Johnson, Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon, and Chief Strategy and Development Officer Gary Niederpruem. Before we begin, I'd point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of burdens. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement, our proxy statement, and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website @investors. vertiv.com. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman Dave Cote.\nDavidCote: I and the Vertiv's team are disappointed and embarrassed by our second half, '21 and projected first-half '22 financial performance. We got behind on the inflation recovery curve with insufficient price and stayed there all year. The past few months Rob and his team have implemented price increases that we expect will generate $360 million year-over-year price versus $260 million incremental inflation. Generating $100 million of favorable price costs for the full-year '22, because much of that price is in the backlog it takes. Several months for the increases show in the financials. And, the vast difference between our expected first half and second half '22 performances. Our unimpressive financial performance was exacerbated by continued supply chain issues, which don't show much sign of abating at this point. Like everyone else out there will hopefully be issued lessons in the second half, but we are counting on much less [Indiscernible]. On the past side our orders were through the roof and 4Q with total company orders up 51% in the Americas up a 114% in the first quarter is off to a good start, even with the price increases. Our short-term performance, including anticipated first half '22 results is unimpressive. Our expected long-term performance starting in the second half of 2022 will be quite impressive. We getting heads finally, on price inflation recovery. Our orders are off the charts and market-leading, supply chain should loose them. We have favorably resolved the tax receivable agreement in two lawsuits, and the product ramp up is just beginning. Some of you may be wondering why I don't get more involved. The answer is, I have. And that's why you see much more aggressive inflation forecasting, price implementation, and other fixes that Rob will talk about. The management is readily accepted and implemented the let's say, suggestions and will deliver as presented. I apologize for putting all our investors during this. That being said, if restructuring this year that should turn around in the second half, the long-term thesis is very intact, especially as performance begins in the second half, if you take the second half run rate into 2023, you can see how intact that thesis is. We know we have to prove it to you, and we will. So with that, I will turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Johnson: Thank you, Dave, the management team and I share the year sentiment about our Q4 results and the outlook for the first half of 2022. But before diving into the key messages on the first slide, let me comment on two topics. First, while Dave has been a good mentor to me over the last two years, our relationship is certainly evolved over the past 60 to 90 days. As is opening comments suggests, he has become much more actively involved in the day-to-day aspects of the business, both on the cost and price side, he is helping me almost daily basis to conduct reviews with our teams and host other business topics. And is my full expectation that this level of involvement will continue through 2022. Secondly, let me address our guidance miss in the fourth quarter for which I take full Responsibility for. In short, we screwed up and some of you undoubtedly are wondering how we could get so surprised. We significantly underestimated the magnitude of the material and freight inflation in the fourth quarter forecast mostly in America, by approximately $36 million. This underestimation cost also contributed to our underpricing in the market in 2021. So it was a huge deal not only for costs, but also price. Half of the inflation miss was related to unforeseen supplier de -commits on critical components and our need to execute spot buys and premium freight to meet customer commitments. The other half is related to forecasting issue within America's region, heavily influenced by our ERP implementation. But also, due to forecasting process issues within the region. These regional costs, forecasting issues have been fixed, and we feel very confident with our cost projections for 2022 as evidenced by our January costs being lower than what we were planning. And that is why we're comfortable with what we have that we have it all carryout. In addition, based upon better understanding of our underlying cost, we have been extremely aggressive with pricing than last 90 days or so. As you will see in today's presentation. To more than offset the higher costs. With this, better understanding of cost and higher pricing, which we're seeing in our year-to-date orders. We're confident that we will deliver strong financial results in the second half of 2022 and beyond. Now, turning to the key messages, on-demand, Vertiv products and services is very strong. Our organic sales were up 4% from Q4 of 2020. The strength of our position in the market can be validated by our order rate, which was up over 50% in Q4 over last year. And has pushed the total Vertiv's backlog to over $3.2 billion. Two, profitability challenge primarily driven because of inflationary headwinds, not because of a flawed strategy, or a decreasing demand for our products and services, but due specifically to inflation, that companies everywhere are battling. our fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was $94 million, which unfortunate was $58 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. We felt inflationary pressures most severely in Americas, but also across our other regions. Our pricing actions increased as the year went on, but they were exceeded by inflationary costs and created $135 million net headwind. We continue to raise price at aggressive rate even as recently as last month, and we will continue to do so to make sure we get ahead of inflation. As you know, and fortunately, we are carrying a large backlog and it takes quarters for that pricing to be fully realized. Fourth, we don't see the full impact of our pricing actions in the first half of 2022 but those actions will kick in during the second half and we expect the second half adjusted operating profit to be approximately $455 million, $230 million over the second half of 2021. Supply chain issues are real and challenging, delaying product completion. The verdict team is battling parts on a daily basis. Our biggest challenge is with electro -mechanical parts and fans. Critical components of many of our verdict products. Internally, we have launched counter measures to address the shortages. However, we expect and have been prepared for supply chain pressures to continue for the majority of 2022. Final and most important key message, although 2021 did not produce the results we expected for reasons I just shared. Vertiv is now well-positioned for strong performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023 due to our aggressive pricing actions in Q4 and early 2022. Turning to Slide 4, recapping our 2021 performance, and then I'll provide some additional detail, what's playing out for 2022. With regard to 2021, we continue to have strong demand for our products. Some of this demand is because we are in a strong growing market. Some is because we are winning with our go-to-market strategies, and some is a result of our Vertiv product development efforts. These three reasons are giving us an order rate that's almost up 30% year-over-year and over 50%, as I mentioned earlier, in fourth quarter. Admittedly, we believe the significant order growth rate in quarter four is an indicator that we could have priced even more aggressively. And adding further confidence that our pricing actions over the next several months are appropriate, and will be received in the market. But a good portion of our $3.2 billion backlog will ship in 2022. Right now, we're getting visibility in the customer plans for 2023 and beyond. This visibility is being provided in the form of forecast, purchase orders providing us greater visibility to our revenue profile. Not only over the next several quarters, but into the future. On the 2021 supply side, we fully expect to be challenged for most of the year. Critical parts availability is spotty and despite all the efforts to qualify second and third sources and redesigned products where possible. We know part shortages or something our industry will grapple with throughout the year. In addition, 2021 inflation got ahead of our pricing just when we thought we had budgeted enough price, inflation got worse. This happened several times. We have corrected it now and are being very conservative in our expectations that inflation will not go away in 2022. The acquisition of ENI closed in November. Integration efforts are in full swing. We remain more confident than ever in our purchase decision. Vertiv will reap the benefits from this complementary nature of ENI's process and products and its ability to be accretive platform from Vertiv's long into the future. And 2021, we invested significantly in ERD just as we planned, we launched several new and innovative products and evidenced by their order rates, these products have exceeded expectations of our acceptance from the market, allowing us to take share in certain categories. In 2021 we invested in ERD of fundamental part of our long-term growth strategy. Now as we turn to 2022 outlook. Our demand environment remained strong, but deliveries remain constrained by part shortages, especially in the semiconductors and electro -mechanical parts that I discussed earlier. We aren't planning to see meaningful improvement in the supply chain this year. We have new production capacity coming online in America's to support our growing thermal business. We are anticipating material and freight costs will continue to increase, but our incremental pricing actions are expected to materially offset 2021 and 2022 inflation by the end of 2022. Pricing realization accelerates throughout '20 to '22 and provide a net price cost tailwind by Q3. We expect profit in the first half of 2022 will remain challenged, but will market re-improve in the second half of the year as price cost turns positive. Due to the pricing actions already initiated, we expect to exit 2022 in a good position. Turning to Slide 5, this is the chart we used to illustrate what we're seeing in the market in each of our regions and each of our end markets. And the cloud and hyper scale markets, they remained strong, represented by Green Buttons in America and EMEA. In APAC however, we see some slowdown as China is pushing cloud and hyper scale companies to maximize our existing facilities. We expect this to be a short-term phenomenon. When looking at our collocation customers, we're not only seeing strength across the regions, but increasing strength in Americas and EMEA. Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 colors are building out data centers to serve their customers. And we are participating in a very healthy way with the building out efforts. Our enterprise, small and medium business markets remained constant for Q4 to Q1. we're experiencing good performance in each region. The pipeline is growing and America is leading the way. The communication network market remains consistently strong with an uptick in Americas as 5G deployment continue to accelerate. The commercial industrial market, things remain a consistent in EMEA and APAC. And we did see an uptick in Americas allowing us to upgrade Americas from yellow to green. While the commercial and industrial market is a smaller slice of our business, the variety of products and services we sell in this market continues to grow. Moving to Slide 6, we closed the E&I acquisition on November 1st, and the integration team has been hard at work ever since. E&I has also faced, and is facing supply constraints and inflation, which is temporarily affected the top and bottom line. E&I has a very healthy backlog. We believe the pricing actions that we've taken in Q4 and will continue to be taken as needed, will be realized in the back half of '22 with E&I as well. We anticipate 2022 revenue from E&I alone to come in around $470 million with an adjusted operating profit of $80 million. Customer reactions to the deal have been nothing short of fantastic. And this acquisition has increased our relevancy with our customers. We expect as 2022 progresses, the synergistic leverage we will get from ENI will enhance our performance in 2023 and beyond. So I might summarize ENI in 2022 as a tough year, but still a great deal. Now I will turn it over to David to walk through the financials. David.\nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Rob. First turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results, which certainly felt short of our external guidance across most of these financial metrics versus last year sales were up a $105 million or 8%, 4% organic when adjusted for the $67 million of sales from E&I and we also had a $13 million foreign exchange headwind. Our fourth quarter top-line, as Rob mentioned, continued to be negatively affected by challenges with procuring parts. As the underlying market demand certainly was much stronger than implied in this year-over-year sales growth, with orders up over 50% compared to last year's fourth quarter. And it's definitely seen with our record high backlog at year-end Without the supply chain constraints and this is a little bit hypothetical, conceptual, our sales growth percentage would have easily been in the double-digits for the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating profit of $94 million fell significantly short of our external guide, and it was primarily driven, if not entirely, by contribution margin, which will summarize in a separate slide in a short bit. On this slide, we captured the drivers of the $58 million reduction in adjusted operating profit from last year's fourth quarter, including $80 million lower contribution margin, which was primarily driven by a $60 million headwind from price cost. Approximately $90 million of material and freight inflation only partially offset by $30 million of incremental pricing. And of note that our pricing was actually relatively consistent with our external guide. As we will discuss with 2022 guidance, we've addressed the $60 million fourth quarter and $135 -- the $60 million fourth quarter, $135 million full-year 2021 price cost and balanced with aggressive price actions taken in the fourth quarter and early 2022. Returning the fourth quarter adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS drop consistent with the adjusted operating profit decline. With adjusted operating margin about 500 basis points lower and adjusted EPS about $0.25 lower than last year's fourth quarter. And finally on this page, fourth-quarter free cash flow was significantly lower than prior year, primarily driven by the lower adjusted operating profit. But also timing of working capital, and about $30 million of cash M&A expenses. Turning to Page 8, this slide summarizes our fourth-quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to be more impacted by supply chain challenges than the other two regions. The supply chain challenges negatively affected both America's top and bottom line. With organic net sales up just $7 million or around 1% against a very strong regional market demand backdrop where orders were more than two times last year's fourth quarter. The left-hand chart at the bottom of the page shows the $69 million year-over-year decline in adjusted operating profit in the Americas. Of course, heavily influenced by price cost. Approximately 70% to 75% of the overall [Indiscernible] price cost headwind for 2021, and in the fourth quarter is in the Americas despite the Americas representing less than 45% of total sales. Freight inflation was particularly acute in the fourth-quarter and accelerated significantly in the U.S. as we progress through the end of the year. Of course, in response to disproportionate net inflation in the Americas, our fourth quarter and 2022 pricing responses have also been much stronger in that region. All things considered APAC posted relatively good results in the fourth quarter with organic sales up almost 3% and adjusted operating profit and margin relatively flat with last year, although not completely immune from the current supply chain, challenges, relatively little of our 2021 net price cost headwind came from APAC. And finally on this slide, moving to the right EMEA showed strong fourth quarter top-line growth with organic sales up 11% however, margins were down about a 130 basis points from last year as the leverage benefit from these higher sales was more than offset by a price cost headwind. Next, turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges fourth quarter adjusted operating profit from our $176 million guidance to the $94 million actual and $82 million negative variance. $46 million of this variance was due to higher-than-expected material freight and labor inflation primarily in the America and especially concentrated on freight, including premium freight for both inbound and outbound shipments to protect customer deliveries, but also due to an increase in standard over the road rates, which were up over 30% from last year's fourth quarter. As we will discuss shortly, our 2022 guidance assumes that these fourth-quarter inflationary headwinds continue and trend even higher in 2022, moving to the right, we incurred approximately $10 million more than an expected sales commission expense in the fourth quarter, primarily due to strong fourth quarter orders up over 50% from last year's fourth quarter. E&I, as Rob mentioned, came in short of expectations in the fourth quarter and volume for overall Vertiv's -- base Vertiv was lower than expected due to the parts availability that we discussed. And finally, on this page, pricing was materially in line with our fourth quarter expectations off about $2 million, but they approximately $53 million that pricing we realized in 2021 has been sticking. And as we will review in a few moments, it is expected to accelerate significantly as we progress through 2022. Next, turning to Slide 10, this page summarizes our full-year 2021 results versus prior year. We won't spend a lot of time on this slide as I'm sure everyone is anxious to understand what we see going forward in 2022, but to summarize 2021, despite the supply chain constraints, we grew our top-line organically by about 11%, which likely would've been over 15% without the supply challenges. Our adjusted operating profit and margin were significantly affected by negative net price costs with almost $190 million of material and freight inflation, only partially offset by $53 million of pricing. Although more aggressive pricing actions were taken at the end of 2021 than implied with the $53 million full-year number realization in our income statement was certainly influenced by our significant backlog, which drive the timing lag between inflation and offsetting price hitting our PNL. We certainly expect pricing to catch up with costs in 2022. And finally on this page, full-year 2021 free cash flow was about $27 million lower than last year with a $92 million cash interest benefit from debt restructuring, more offset by an inventory build. Cash M&A expenses in higher capex and cash taxes. Now, flipping a couple of slides, we transition from 2021 actuals to 2022 guidance beginning with Slide 12. But before we dive in, you will see that we supply a lot of detail within our 2022 guidance, including first-half, second-half, and quarterly breakouts for expected sales adjusted operating profit, and also pricing and inflation. We are providing this detail because we realize -- absolutely realized we have likely damaged some of our credibility in 2021, notably with the quality of our external guidance. And we want to be fully transparent with you with how we see the year unfolding. It is impossible to understand the dynamics within 2022 with looking at only full-year figures. And as you will see, our anticipated second half of 2022 is much different and much improved from the first half. And each quarter improved sequentially from the previous quarter. This expected improvement both in the second half and with each successive quarter, is driven by accelerating price cost benefit versus 2021. Of course, we understand that providing this level of detail likely creates the expectation for us to supply the same level of details we've progress through the year. And we were absolutely prepared to do that and we will update our assumptions and projections for all inputs as appropriate. And we know that you'll track with us every step of the way. So with that said, finally, getting to the content on Slide 12, this page summarizes our broad expectations for 2022 by splitting our guidance between first and second half. We expect first half to continue to be challenged by parts availability with underlying organic volume when you remove price to be down 5% year-over-year. Despite the record year-end backlog as we do not see significant supply chain constraints lessening at all in the first half of '22 versus what we saw at the end of 2021. In addition, although price costs recovers as we exit the second quarter, it is still projected to be upside down by approximately $70 million for the full first half. The second half is a much different story as we expect financial performance to improve significantly from the first half, we assume 6% higher organic volume. Once again, excluding price and part of that is based on a greater visibility to allocation of parts in the second half. And this second percent higher organic volume and -- could be conservative based upon our backlog and the end market demand. But once again, the underlying driver of improved sales performance in the second half is pricing. Based upon pricing actions that we have already taken; we expect $250 million of incremental year-over-year pricing in the second half alone. And as a result, price cost is expected to be a positive $170 million in the second half. Significantly improve in adjusted operating profit, with adjusted operating margin increasing to 14%. Our expectations for a strong second-half pertains, a strong 2023 as we capture additional year-over-year pricing from actions already taken, as virtually all sales in 2023 will be at the higher pricing. While we have significant sales in 2022, as we mentioned, from our existing backlog at lower historical pricing levels and will further explain this dynamic and a couple of slides. But let's move on to slide 13. This is another slice of our guidance going from a first-half, second-half perspective to a quarterly perspective. Net sales adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating margins are all projected to sequentially increase as we progress through the year. And as we mentioned on the prior slide, the primary driver of this sequentially improving financial performance is the timing of price realization. The chart at the bottom left illustrates the quarterly profitability trend for both 2021 and 2022. Our price cost issues began in the third quarter of 2021 and we anticipate them to be addressed after the second quarter of this year. So we're almost three quarters of our way through what we see is a fourth quarter issue. As price costs turns positive for each of the last two quarters of 2022. Finally, on this page, the chart at the upper right shows the relatively conservative volume assumptions inherent in the plan. With full-year organic volume, once again, excluding pricing, assume to increase just 1% as we do not assume significantly improving parts availability as we progress through the year. And we will continuously assess that assumption, as we go forward. Next, turning to Slide 14, this page details our year-over-year quarterly price costs or net inflation assumptions for 2022. For the full year, we expect to generate $100 million favorable year-over-year price costs, including the assumption of $360 million of price offset by $260 million of incremental inflation. As discussed in the prior slides, our quarterly pricing increases sequentially as the proportion of sales from existing backlog declines as you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page. Also very important, we should have significant carryover price benefit into 2023 as we expect 95% of next year sales to be at the higher pricing levels. While in 2022, only 50% were, and this drives in an expectation for about $200 million of carryover pricing impact for 2023. Now from an inflation perspective, we assume that what we experienced exiting 2021 will continue through full-year 2022. That's an approximately $160 million year-over-year carryover negative impact. But in addition, we have assumed $100 million of new inflation in 2022. 20 -- as Rob mentioned, 2021 actual inflation outpaced our expectations, each step of the way, and we believe it prudent to assume that inflation will continue to worsen in 2022, which drives the $100 million incremental assumption. And we definitely will reevaluate this new inflation assumption as we progress through 2022. Now based on the foregoing assumptions, we expect price cost to be neutral in the second quarter, and as mentioned, significantly favorable for the second half beginning in the third quarter. Next, turning to Slide 15, this page supplies some color on our confidence that the $360 million pricing number for 2022 is achievable and will stick. The first as we saw in the previous page, the first $125 million of the $360 is actually included in our year-end backlog. So we risk assess that from highly probable to certain. Now the second $235 million is based on pricing projections in new 2022 orders that will book and shift within the year. Based upon the market acceptance of our fourth quarter price increase, evidenced by the 51% increase in orders. We certainly saw the opportunity to be much more aggressive with 2022 pricing. In late 2021 and early 2022, we initiated multiple waves of list price increases. And this is across all product lines in all regions. Although we certainly were a bit more aggressive in both the Americas and EMEA, where inflation has been more pronounced. Based upon our order rates, so far in January and February, which are in line or even a little bit higher than last year's order rates for that same period. It appears that our higher pricing is sticking in this high demand, short supply market environment. Of course, we will continue to reevaluate this assumption and reassess our pricing as we progress through the year. As we have mentioned many times, we believe we operate in a great position in a good industry. Data center demand for our equipment, and more importantly, our technology is not abating anytime soon and it should continue to accelerate going forward. With the backdrop of rising global costs. In this long-term market demand, we believe our price increases are justifiable, reasonable and achievable. But in fact, one lesson learned as we manage price increases over the last nine months or so, is that we have historically underestimated our ability to get price. And based upon the success of our recent price actions, we have absolute confidence that we will be able to drive consistent price increases going forward. Turning to Slide 16, this page summarizes our full-year 2022 financial guidance. We provide added detail in the appendix to aid analysts and investors with modeling. Overall, we expect 13% top-line growth, 8% organic. Components of this organic growth are 7% price and 1% volume, as our assumption is that the supply chain constraints do not significantly ease in 2022 and only in the fourth quarter if at all, we will continue to reassess this possibly conservative assumption as we go through the year, full-year adjusted operating profit is expected to increase $54 million or 11%. With base Vertiv relatively flat, and most of the increase coming from net acquisitions and divestitures, there is an $85 million a year-over-year increase in fixed costs. And we provide some additional color on that increase in the appendix. As we showed in prior slides, quarterly adjusted operating profit and margin increased sequentially with higher pricing. With fourth quarter operating profit projected to be $255 million. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin expected to be $0.15. And fourth quarter. adjust EPS to exceed $0.40 a share. So even though full-year financial metrics are not overly impressive, we should be exiting 2022 in a very good position. Finally, on this page, we summarize both adjusted EPS and free cash flow for 2022, and once again, we supply underlying assumptions for each in the appendix. Now turning to Slide 17, this page summarizes our first quarter financial guidance. As we previewed in prior slides, our performance in the first quarter will continue to be challenged by negative price cost, about $70 million in the quarter and supply chain constraints will unfavorably affect year-over-year organic volume. We estimate by about $45 million. Now, the net impact is not great as shown by the expected $20 million adjusted operating loss. But these first quarter results should be the net year for our quarterly financial performance, as we project consistent quarterly improvement as we go through 2022 based on actions we have already initiated, including by delivering $360 million of higher pricing for full-year 2022, but also pricing actions should deliver an additional carryover impact of $200 million into 2023. Now with that said, I turn it back over to Rob.\nRobert Johnson: Thanks, David. Now let's turn to slide 18. I know this quarter's earnings report is not what you expected from us and is not what we expected from ourselves. We got caught up in supply chain challenges that reflects most of the world and we did not appropriately anticipate inflationary pressures, we would experience as we tried to obtain parts, we needed to manufacture our products. We have a great position in a good industry. We have world-class products and service offerings. We have a talented team. We are relevant to our customers. We are cultivating our relationships, and we are investing in our future. And we have a clear line of sight to our margin expansion goals. While I'm extremely disappointed in our performance in Q4, I'm confident in our ability to deliver on our 2022 commitments and how the new actions we have taken have set us up to deliver a very impressive 2023. In the end, our success for 2022 and beyond is highly dependent on our ability to deliver pricing commitments that we have communicated today. And I have the confidence that we'll be able to deliver that. I take personal responsibility for this to. To Vertiv employees around the world. Thank you for the work you've done and continue to do. And the support you provided me to each other and to our customers. With that said, I want to thank all of you for listening today, and I will now turn the call over to the operator who will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: We will begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A. Our first question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research, please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, everybody. Rough day for everyone, but -- look I want to get a sense of the -- whether you need to change your sales commission structure or looks like your sales force is getting paid to -- to book unprofitable contracts. How -- do you need to change that or am I misreading it? I'm just trying to get a sense of the incentive system internally. And how it might need to change in 2022?\nRobert Johnson: No, so to be clear, are they're not paid to book unprofitable business. We actually have an unruly instituted over the last 60, 90 days, even tighter controls, so they don't have the ability, just a discount to grow the backlog and grow the business. We have a very tight, rigorous process that goes all the way up to certain levels and including myself, depending on what discounts are trying to do. So we hold that tight from that perspective, so that they don't have the freedom to just discount, to build backlog or to go book orders. And in different parts of the world, we have profitability as part of the overall sales compensation. So again, the answer would be no, they're not paid to book unprofitable business.\nScott Davis: Rob, from a cultural perspective, it seems like Vertiv is a place where maybe bad news doesn't travel up as fast as it should. You guys reported on October 27th, you already had one of the three months of the quarter in your back pocket, how did you guys miss it from a rate of change perspective, at least. What was the breakdown is financial controls is that as their cultural challenges, they are learning from this that -- because we cover a lot of companies and you guys are an outlier at the extreme end of really getting hit here?\nRobert Johnson: Yes. So a couple of things I'd have to say here, kind of said in my opening comments, we did have some issues upfront with our ERP and Americas. To be clear, we didn't see the rate of inflation that we're actually experiencing till later in the quarter and the later month. We did however see an increase in spot buys and expedited freight in order to counter supplier decommit. So when we came out in our last earnings call, supply for us with certain suppliers, with our products actually got worse and de -commits happened and accelerated throughout the quarter. So it really wasn't necessarily, I would say a cultural issue as more of a system issue and our ability to see that as we changed over ERP. And secondly, we consciously made decisions to pay expedited freight and drive spot buys in order to counter the de -commits from our suppliers.\nScott Davis: Okay, that's helpful.\nDavid Cote: Yeah. If you don\u2019t mind Scott, this is David Cote and I will probably ask Dave Fallon to interject also. 75% of our issue approximately is the Americas. And I think we're obviously being a little too kind. In the Americas there was a cultural issue between the sales guys and operations guys truly understanding what was going on. When the October results were actually okay. November looked a little bit worse, but not distressingly so. And we got the report that December was going to recover.\nDavid Fallon: When we got the December results. That's where all of a sudden everything seemed to crash. And we didn't really know all the details of it till we got to the latter part of January and spent a good part of February trying to figure out what the heck was going on and what we had to do. And Rob and I got significantly more involved with what did we have to do to resolve the cultural issues that did exist in the America s, and that's been addressed. When it came to inflation, it was clear we had been under forecasting what was going to happen with inflation. And I would argue some of that was a cultural issue, also, which we have addressed.\nDavid Cote: And that's why we've been so aggressive on the pricing side. And if you take a look at our Americas ' orders, they were up 115% in the fourth quarter, which as Dave pointed out is an indication that we could've been pricing a lot better than we did and we have adjusted that, and that's why we're pleased to see that as we go into January, at least from what we can see February so far, orders in the Americas are continuing to grow even over what was a good first quarter of '21. But we've had to get much more heavily involved in resolving these issues. confident, they have been resolved and they will continue to work with the new process. And it's why I'm encouraged by what I see for the second half, which I think gives us a very good lead into the future and gets us back where we should have been all along. I think Dave's right. The -- one of our learnings from all this is how we've underestimated our ability to get price. Historically, not just currently, but historically. And that's another dynamic that's going to change. So yes, there has been a significant amount of change that's occurred over the last 60 days. And I think Rob -- Rob Dave, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add there?\nDavid Fallon: No. I think those are fair comments, Dave. I think they are fair comments.\nDavid Cote: Thank you. Good luck, guys. Will pass it on.\nDavid Fallon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Yeah, thanks. Good morning.\nDavid Fallon: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: So I guess maybe just elaborate on everything you guys just said. Where I'm struggling a little bit is understanding how you'd make such big cultural changes in the scope of two months. So maybe you could give some examples to kind of help us. And what has changed about the planning process in 2022 to give your investors confident that this isn't going to happen again?\nRobert Johnson: I'll address some of the culture issues upfront. Dave, can talk a little bit about -- and I'll talk a little bit about the planning process and Dave can come in over the top. As it relates to cultural issues. Again, the organization probably -- not probably, organization didn't and wasn't set up to drive a lot of price previous years, we've shown $20, $25 million in price. And what we really had to do really top down. Dave, myself, and others in the management team is really drive all the way down to the sales people. What it means to get price, how to get price, and not to be afraid to lose orders as we go through that. So that's something culturally losing orders with something that we had to overcome and say, it's okay from the perspective of, we've got to go drive price. And it's proven out that that works and that we were able to get price as Dave mentioned, probably should have and could have got more price in Q4 and Americas with the order backlog that we saw, the other cultural issue that they talked about is really the FIOP process for Americas, and really having that tighter pulled together so that the demand and the supply and those constraints, we're working closely together, coupled by an exacerbation of that, of a new ERP system that came in that we had lack of visibility for a period of time which has now since then fixed from that perspective. So it's on the culture side and then on the process side, we are well beyond the implementation of our ERP as it relates to and by evidence of January's results, we have visibility into what our PPV is and our price purchase variances and have a good handle on what inflation's looking like. So we were behind throughout the quarter, as Dave mentioned, got into December, recognize what was going on and have implemented both process changes as I talked earlier on pricing levels of approval, as well as a process levels with the integration of Americas, operations and supply and sales, and any other comments, David Fallon or David Cote?\nDavid Fallon: I 100% agree with your -- your comments. Rob and Nicole oftentimes when it comes to forecasting, it's a lot of blocking and tackling. And I would say we have instituted a lot of rigor in the last 60 days. Specifically, around the Americas ' forecasting process to the extent that last Thursday, both Rob and I were effectively in and out of a meeting that lasted from 9:00 AM in the morning to 10:00 PM at night. And so we're putting a lot of diligence into this and we understand our credibility was harmed as it related to forecasting. And we will not let that happen again. And we're confident with the steps and processes we put together for that specific issue.\nOperator: Okay [Indiscernible]\nDavid Cote: Just to add a little more color, Nicole, the Americas ' cultural issue was always there. It's just, it wasn't visible in a stable cost and supply chain environment. It became extraordinarily visible as we started to run into those two problems. And to a date balance point, Rob, pull together a come-to-Jesus meeting with the Americas operations and sales folks to say, this is not happening anymore, I'm not going to be the operator of your issues. You're going to sorted out just like we were able to in EMEA and APAC on your own and we want to figure out where exactly are we now and how do we have a better process going forward? In today's point I went on all day and then Rob and Dave came in at the conclusion and we adjusted what we thought was going to happen for '22 as a result of that, negatively, but it allowed us to be able to figure out where the bottom was a lot better than we had in the past. And they have changed the process that they're going to use going forward, both culturally and mechanically. And Rob and Dave are going to be very involved going forward. In understanding that reconciliation every month to make sure that we truly understand what the hell is going on. So yes, I'm confident that we've addressed that at this point, but this is -- this is going to take more than just a one-time meeting. It's going to require Rob and Dave's constant attention to make sure that it sticks, and they're doing that.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks. That's really helpful color. I appreciate all of that, and I'll just ask a quick one to follow up to give someone else a chance, so the order activity was obviously really strong this quarter. What did it look like, excluding E&I? And maybe you could comment on organic backlog as well. I put out the E&I contribution from underlying part of --\nDavid Fallon: Yeah, Nicole so the order rate percentages are all without E&I because we haven't tried to approximate what orders were or would've been in the fourth quarter of 2020. So that order rate is all excluding ENI. But if you look at the backlog, the $3.2 billion of backlog that does include the ENI, and I think ENI is just a little bit short of $300 million at year-end. So the base Vertiv backlog is somewhere between $2.9 and $3 billion.\nNicole DeBlase: Very helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nDavid Fallon: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thanks. Good morning. Not to beat a dead horse on that last thread, but I just wanted to come back to A, ERP system, and if in fact all the kings store worked out and B, I was a little concerned to hear the comment that the teams are left that figure it out and we'll monitor them. It sounds like it requires much more direct marching orders, perhaps that has happened and it was a conveyed in that answer. But I think we're all still looking for some level of assurance, if you will, that we've righted the ship and everybody's kind of rowing in the same direction here.\nRobert Johnson: Hi Jeff. This is Rob. A couple, a couple of things, comments and others can chime in. It's because the teams aren't left to just go figure it out on their own. Combination of myself, Dave Cote being involved and Dave Fallon have given strict marching orders or what needs to happen. They need to make it happen. So it's not, they go figure it out and come report out to us. We have given specific instructions as to what they need to do, what needs to happen, guess what Dave is saying is they need to drive that, make that happen, we will monitor that, but no doubt that from top down, we're driving that message to the team, the three of us. Secondly, on the ERP system, as you know, all the ERP systems are difficult in their own ways and in this particular one, while things went cut-over, we were able to continue to ship and do the basic business functions that you'd expect to do that some people get caught up. We didn't have that problem. It was more of an understanding of the price variance and things that we didn't get to later on. We've since then fixed that as any ERP system, you do have things you fixed after the launch. And that's where we got caught up and kind of got behind on the visibility and then begin to better understand that as we got into December and really towards the end of January, and it took us a little bit longer to assess where we were at and making sure that we now understand our PPV. Any other comments from Dave Cote or Dave Fallon?\nDavid Fallon: Yeah. The -- monitor, I guess is not a strong enough word. And I will -- I'll leave it to Dave and Rob to use whatever strong word is required, but they're going to be much more involved in understanding did the reconciliation work the way it was supposed to. As to having the team figure it out, and the approach that we took, this is a tool that I generally use, and I've talked about in the past, because you can't have the CEO always having to tell people just work together. They have to do it, they have to recognize the problem, and they have to fix the processes themselves, and have to come up with, here's how we're going to do it going forward. And it starts with, they got to recognize they have a problem, which they have done. And the fixes that they've developed didn't just fix what we had as the current forecast, but it's going to get fixed going forward. And like with any new process, you don't just set it up and walk away. You still have to monitor, or use a stronger word, be involved to understand that it's happening. And I can assure you, both Rob and Dave are committed to making sure that that happens that way.\nJeff Sprague : You address a lot of cash. But thanks for that. Could you just address free cash flow for us? And obviously you're taken a big hit here, working capital and other things. They are trying to get us to think about 23 and your exit rate that's probably going to take some points on the board [Indiscernible], before people want to fully underwrite that, but I'd love your thoughts or commentary on what the normalized free cash flow where those companies should be maybe presented as or in the framework of maybe a free cash flow margin, free cash flow to sales for example?\nDavid Fallon: Yes, thanks Jeff, this is David, so I would say our guide for 2022, it's certainly uninspiring. I think $150 million. There are some elements of that guide that might be one-off. So for example, our capex for 2022 is projected to be about $130 million. That's probably a little bit elevated, number one, some of the 21 capex split into 22, but we do have some capacity expansion dollars in there as well. I would say a more normalized capex number, on an annual basis is probably around a $100 million or so. So that's one element. The number one driver of the free cash flow, in the long-term is going to be the EBITDA. And the full year EBITDA is certainly not what it should be for 2022, but if you look at what we're going to do in the second half, notably in Q4, you annualize that, that is going to be a direct contributor to much higher free cash flow. And I think our guidance at the beginning of '21 was $285 million. I would say, based on where we are, especially after the pricing increases go through, our run rate should be much higher than that. It's a little bit of a hypothetical but our overall goal is to get a 100% of free cash flow and the conversion on that income. The other thing I would add, Jeff for Mr. Sprague is that if U -- AOP is a good indicator, I think of operating cash flow. And if you take a look at our fourth-quarter run rate, and then the $200 million of price carryover in 23 that Dave referenced earlier, that puts us in a very good AOP position. That is the biggest driver of what free cash flow will be.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes, sir. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First is about the assumption of $100 million of incremental inflationary cost off of the December run rate. Maybe you can elaborate on how you're coming up with that number, and how much of that based on what suppliers are saying they may answer to it in terms of pricing, and what you're having good line of sight into, and how much is -- you're potentially trying to be more conservative on the inflationary metric, even if it's not cost issues you've already been seeing.\nDavid Fallon: Yeah. Thanks Mark. This is David and I think it really is a combination of all the things you mentioned. I would not be completely honest if I said that there is an element of conservatism included in that. And that's based on our lessons from last year. Every time we put a [Indiscernible] in the ground. As it relates -- related to inflation, it got worse. And we saw that, especially in the Americas as we progress through the year. And most notably in EMEA, as we exited the year. So there is a provision per conservatism, but certainly a part of that $100 million is based on what we're seeing currently, so it would be hard for me to handicap a specific dollar for what we're seeing and how much it is conservatism, but that's something that we will better be able to reassess as we go through the year and we can provide an update on that at the end of the first quarter.\nMark Delaney: In any of the input costs stabilize that give you confidence a $100 million, is it conservative number or what, why wouldn't have potentially just keep going up at the same rate that it did last year?\nDavid Fallon: We've actually -- there are -- there is some good news out there, notably, with some of the commodity prices, and in particular, with steel in the U.S. Our pricing for steel, which is our most prevalent commodity, the -- is indexed based on an average price of the quarter before. And steel prices have come down fairly nicely since the mid fourth quarter. We've seen some of that benefit in our Q1 pricing. But if the lower steel prices hold through the end of Q1, we should definitely see a benefit in Q2. We have not built into any of our forecast. Any -- in any specific component or commodity improving this year. So that would be an excellent example of a specific piece of conservatism built into our forecasting.\nMark Delaney: There was just on the procurement strategy for 2022 to what extent is Vertiv locking in contracts that prices that's giving you visibility into what your expenses will be, but also you could touch a little bit on your ability to get that supply or you mentioned de -commit were occurring. Have you taken steps to changing procurement strategy to have better certainty and how you're able to deliver both to the financial community, but also your customers? Thanks.\nRobert Johnson: Hey, this is Rob, a couple of things there as it relates to getting price and getting that in the contracts, there is a couple of things we've changed to is getting that price, but also putting escalators in there if commodities change outside a certain boundary. So that's something we have done and put into the contracts. It wasn't in all of our contracts prior, so we're looking at we can never predict where it's going to go and we believe what David just said, but I would say as a backstop, the ability to get additional price, if necessary, if things continue beyond a threshold from that perspective. As it relates to supply, I mentioned earlier in my discussion was, we've done a few things, we're not just sitting here saying how we can't get it. We've either qualified additional suppliers, we've modified, or re-engineered certain parts and allowed for additional supply base to help us out. So as it relates to, we keep continue to talk about fans being a problem with qualified additional vendors there and also have changed some of the design there that uncouples it from maybe some of the constraints that we have. So we look at that, whether it's displays, whether it's qualifying additional IGBTs vendors, which is a big part of our power conversion products and the DC power, one of the things you'll see from us is that from a IGBT perspective, which is the power conversion, we have a DC power business that most of our competitors don't. We buy a significant amount of those. So getting additional supply base, additional suppliers. And a lot of this got started even pre all of this inflationary and supply constraint. It was really as COVID hit, and it taught us a lesson to qualify and drive additional suppliers. And we'll continue to do that, even as, hopefully at some point in time, who knows when inflation goes in the -- we have deflation in the other direction. Our strategy is still to make sure that we have multiple suppliers all the way down through our design process so that we don't single source. And those fires aren't just in one particular region, they have multiple regions because we've learned that, while I may have multiple suppliers and they might be fan vendors out of Germany, that could cause a problem. I need to have supply base in different parts of the region.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Lance Vitanza with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nLance Vitanza: Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. On Slides 13, I'm looking at the adjusted operating profit guide for 2022 and I see the $200 million in Q3 and the $255 in Q4. My question is, is there any seasonality based into that trajectory? I'm trying to figure out what I think about the run rate, the starting point for 2023. Do I want to think about annualized in the back half or not? Do you think we really should be thinking about annualized in Q4 as a run rate to start from in January 23?\nDavid Fallon: I -- there's likely some seasonality in Q4 projections for 2022, but not nearly what we normally would have. I would say, Q4 is certainly a better run rate projection for 2023. With that said, Q1 2023 is probably going to be lower than Q4 2022, but it's a lot easier to annualize that Q4 2022 number than it would be to do that in any other year. And that's because we are assuming continual -- our continued supply constraint in that number. And of course, we're hopeful that some of that actually gets rectified as we enter the second half.\nLance Vitanza: Okay, and with the stock, 1112 bucks a share, can we expect to see suite management to be buying shares in the coming days? And how about the company buying back some stock? Is there any opportunity to do that based on your liquidity profile covenants and so forth?\nDavid Fallon: Yeah, I certainly can address from a Vertiv perspective. We look at alternative uses for our cash on a continuous basis. Certainly, based on the stock reaction today. A stock buyback would definitely the more attractive than it was yesterday. So it's not making any commitments whatsoever, but it is something that we would strategically evaluate.\nLance Vitanza: And the last question for me is on the balance sheet. Could you talk about your plans to de -lever pay down debt and then [Indiscernible] from a liquidity standpoint, I see the free cash flow guidance target for the year, but could you talk about when you expect your cash plus available borrowings? When does that bottom out? And at what level? And are there any maintenance covenants perhaps in your revolver that could further crimp liquidity or maybe even trigger a potential default as we progress through the year?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. On the last one, no issues on any covenants. I think there's one covenant within the ABL. It's fixed charge coverage ratio and we have ample room for that, that will not be initiative this year. As it relates to use of cash -- and maybe 2021 was the exception, but we generally have our lowest free cash flow in Q1, we had positive free cash flow last year. This year, we will definitely use cash so similar to the financial projections, the free cash flow should progressively improve as we go through the year as well. I would say sometime probably early third quarter would be the bottom point as it relates to liquidity. We do have as we mentioned, we resolve the tax receivable agreement. There's a $50 million payment at the end of June and the September. I think soon after that $50 million payment at the end of the June would be the bottom part. With the -- I'm sorry, the bottom of our liquidity and then it should improve thereafter.\nLance Vitanza: Thanks very much.\nDavid Fallon: Yes, thanks, Lance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Nigel Coe, with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking [Indiscernible] time here. I apologize for background noise in chirping. But I just want to go back to pricing, maybe just if you bigger address, how do you change incentive structures around price specifically to make sure that that behavior change is getting hardwired in comps? And then maybe just address the order strength in Americas in 4Q. How confident are you that that wasn't related to upcoming price increases and therefore, pre -buying ahead of that and perhaps also if you could just -- I know it's a multipart question, but if you could address maybe the pricing on current ordered engine backlog relative to 77 drop prices into your guide.\nRobert Johnson: Nigel, thanks for the question. This is Rob. I'll answer the first two and then David Fallon can come over on the third one. As I mentioned earlier, some of the behavioral changes that we've put in place across the world is really authority and approval. One of the quickest ways to get there is stop discounting. We've raised these prices appropriately, but you can lose price through discounting. We've changed those thresholds across the globe. We've changed the level in which those decisions can be made all the way up to myself and David as CFO so that we don't give away the pricing that we were getting through discounting. So that is a I'd call it a cultural thing and a change that we implemented over the over the last 60, 90 days. And we believe that very effective, although painful for the organization, it's the right thing to do to guarantee that we get this price. Could you take a look at specifically Americas, what the dynamic that's going on there and our market overall is -- it's a [Indiscernible], constraint in general, lead times have gone out for whether it's generators, whether it's breakers, whatever it might be. And I think what we saw is -- and what we'll continue to see is people are putting orders and to get their slots to make sure they get supply where that used to be maybe they order 6 months ahead, 3 months ahead. In some cases, they're ordering and looking at 12, maybe 18 months as we go forward. The demand is extremely strong on a global basis, and that's why you're seeing that uptick overall. It wasn't a rush to get it before price because of a lot of that had pricing actions that were taken in November, back in October or September, and then more recently in December. The strength for us really comes from -- a lot around the Colo Cloud, but also even in the channel. We've seen growth as we continue to increase price there. We continue to see growth around the Vertiv product offering. David on the third one? Or Gary.\nGary Niederpruem : Thanks Rob. Hey Nigel, it's Gary. Thank you, your last question was specifically around pricing in the backlog, and so the pricing of the backlog, as we entered January first was right around $125 million give or take a little bit. So probably just north of 4%, 4.5% somewhere in that range. And if you look at the momentum with the pricing that we had in 2021, every quarter got stronger with Q4 being the high point. So we feel good to whatever one\u2019s comments have been up to this point in time that it really is. We had to believe it ourselves almost in order to be able to take that next step function. So we saw that step function in Q4 between that data point, between the data point of $125 - ish million of pricing in the backlog going into this year as Number 2 and then Number 3, even what we've seen in January so far in early February, the price increases that we put out at the end of Q4 and even in Q doesn't seem to have materially changed the order input right at this point in time. So all of that gives us confidence of how we're going to continue to build up pricing as the year goes on.\nNigel Coe: Okay. [Indiscernible] say questions. I'll leave it there. Thanks, you all.\nRobert Johnson: Thanks Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hi, guys. Good afternoon, I guess.\nRobert Johnson: Good afternoon, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just on this whole pricing discussion, how will this change next year and the year after that when we go back to what the industry has really been historically, which is generally negative price on the equipment and then a little bit of price on services? I mean, the fact that you're changing these discounts in the fourth quarter of 2021, when it was pretty readily apparent to everybody early last year that there were going to be issues here. I don't know what your competitors are doing because they are buried in larger organizations. But I mean, do you see the same kind of behavior from them as well, or is this something unique and specific to you guys? I guess, my question is just, how are you so confident that you can maintain a spread like that in an industry that is typically -- had very challenged pricing to begin with?\nRobert Johnson: Steve, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. Traditionally, I think culturally you may have heard earlier, we didn't think -- David said, we didn't think as a company we could go out and be strong with a price. But what I really see is happening, where we're getting prices, where we're differentiating, where we're developing, call them unique or innovative products and solutions. And the organization -- you're absolutely right. The industry culturally hasn't gone there because a lot of areas haven't been providing innovation. So where we have innovated in certain areas, like thermal management and so forth, those are areas that we found on learns to this. So we can actually get price and continue to get price for innovation. And that's the basis of our thesis. And reason we've been driving our R&D up is, fundamentally, we believe with innovation providing stronger products with customers we can get that price, we can get a higher price than those that aren't innovating in those section and as you may know, we don't compete, I know lot of people think it's just the big guys that are part of big conglomerates. We compete with a lot of locals that you wouldn't know that don't report out. And those also are experiencing these commodity are specific price cost issues as well. So we have seen people follow and we look at the different parts of the market. And as we've gone to it, what we found is we're Vertiv products are preferred where we have that innovation pricing sticks and people will pay us more. So we've learned something through this process and we will continue to apply that throughout the years. And the other --\nSteve Tusa: Thank you. Yes. You mentioned like thermal, I guess, so that's on like the HVAC side.\nRobert Johnson: Yeah. Thermal management products, areas of certain power distribution E&I. Other PDUs where we have strength and it again, you're absolutely right, in the past, that hasn't been but as we've driven innovation and as we've gone through this process, the team has really reset at mind in understanding we can get paid for the things we do where we differentiate and that's when we'll continue to focus on that differentiation to drive that price and hold that price for the future.\nSteve Tusa: Got it and then just wanted to clarify the cash side. I guess --\nDavid Fallon: Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Yeah.\nDavid Cote : If I could just interject something, a building on Rob's cultural point is I'd say historically we also underestimated the value of that differentiation that already existed. And we had our predisposition or deference to not lose the auto. And if you approach it that way, you will generally own the price. And this process has shown us that not only is our new innovation worth more than we thought, the innovation that already exist in our products and it's been historically under-priced, and this has been a really good warning for all of us in the business. So we've got a lot more capacity for price than we ever realized,\nSteve Tusa: Right. And just on those orders, you mentioned that some people are ordering 12 months to 18 months out. How much of your orders do you think are unusually timed, if you will? I know some companies said like 10% to 15%. How much unusually timed do you think will not be there in the normal cadence as we move through the year as things normalize?\nRobert Johnson: What we're seeing right now and from the pipelines and the discussions I'm having with most of our large customers, we continue to see a robust environment of orders. It -- I think this goes well beyond '22 into '23 into '24. I think there is just an enormous appetite for datacenter space on a global basis, Steve. We have not seen this kind of level. Normally, it's -- IMEA is growing faster, or it's Asia or it's Americas. This phenomenon that we're seeing now and experiencing is global expansion of data centers in all parts of the world. There's a lot more companies involved in the Tier 2, Tier 3 colos, a lot more building going -- being done for the hyperscalers. What I'd say is, it wasn't just an unusual time or one-off. I continue to see the market to be capacity constrained because of the volume of data centers that are needed to be built. And as we look at our pipeline, 18, 24 months ahead, it's more robust than we've ever seen.\nSteve Tusa: Got it. Good luck through the beginning of the year. Thanks.\nRobert Johnson: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you. I have two questions, I guess. Close up. Thank you for all the details are on calendar '22. You spent a fair amount of time talking about all the issues and challenges, how you intend to fix them, which has been helpful. Maybe you could spend a few minutes talking about how does incentive compensation get aligned to fix these challenges and maybe you could talk about on the sales side where you seem to have some issues and also on the management level. What [Indiscernible] the incentive comp change at all to rectify some of the challenges you had?\nRobert Johnson: Sure. This is Rob, I'll start out there as it relates to management. I mean, we are completely aligned with the share-owners and what we want to deliver. And that's really the earnings and profitability as we go forward. And as we look at goals and [Indiscernible] set for 2022, pricing is absolutely in there from a management, not just my team, but my team teams below and pricing is one of those, what we call okay-or-us, objectives for the year that we need to hit. As mentioned earlier, the incentive from the sales side. And again, depending on the part of the world, is primarily right now driven by their ability to discount or not discount. Sales -- they need to get sales with price to get more quota at the higher price. I guess in general, the higher price they get, the more quota attainment they retire. And it's true for, if I take a look at the selling regime that we have in America today, the salespeople are incented to get a higher price because they've got a higher multiplier and a higher commission when it comes to that. I'd say that we feel like the areas we need to really shore up was where that price leakage could happen on big deals and other areas and really push back on that and put higher levels of approval so that we're not giving price away further down in the organization. So I feel confident that both sales and management throughout the globe understands and gets the price and understand what it's going to mean to them, ultimately, in their wallet.\nDavid Cote : The other thing -- I'm sorry. The other thing I would add is. as you might expect, what Rob is recommending to the Board is significantly lower than what a normal payout would be. And Rob is also recommending that he and his team take a zero bonus this year. I don't know how much more of an incentive you need than that to make things to work. But also, their comp is largely focused on equity. And a big part of this is driving -- making sure the stock price goes up. So they're heavily incented to make sure that all these things get fixed.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. That's really helpful. Let me just follow up, a lot of the expectations for '22 are predicated on how good the order book is, how good the backlog is multi billion, at least what you mentioned, can you just talk about your conviction that there's not a lot of double-ordering or the quality of the backlog is good. Is there any way to think about what's the duration of this backlog today versus what it would normally be potentially?\nDavid Fallon: As we think about it, we look at each order when it comes in, and it's not just a blanket order for this many units. Our orders are specific sites, specific jobs, specific locations where they need to go. That gives us confidence. And this question has been asked over the last couple of years of, as the backlog increases or as the order rate increases, our people double and triple ordering. We don't believe that's the case whatsoever, that people just put in blanket orders just to cover themselves.\nRobert Johnson: These are specific projects as we go forward. If you take a look at the duration, the backlog, we used to say maybe it's 9 to 12 months or nine to 15, maybe it's a little bit longer than that or 6 to 9 months. Now it's 9 to 15, something like that, but it's not -- things don't get in the backlog if there are two years out, that type of thing. We are -- while people are looking to drive orders to us for that, what you'll see as the duration hasn't moved that much, maybe by, let's say, a quarter or three months type of thing based on what we've seen. Gary, you see anything different than that?\nGary Niederpruem : I think that's exactly Rob. Right Rob, there's no indication of double order in anywhere I met. And you're right, we would always say the backlog -- everything we have in backlog turn in about 12-month period of time. Maybe that's slightly elongated to 15-18 months. Just because even our customers are having a hard time getting trades people on site Friday, all that type of stuff. But if you look at our backlog today, there's probably only 5% to 10% of it that is scheduled out in 2023. And really customers are telling us that they would take the product as soon as they can get it. So there's nothing in the 2024 or 2025 by any means.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: Yeah, guys. Good afternoon.\nRobert Johnson: Good afternoon.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: Just taking a longer picture. The medium-term goal for adjusted operating margin was 15% plus. How do you think about the bridge from the '22 midpoint of 9.3% up to 15%? You highlighted more aggressive pricing, but also how much do you think what's happening is structural in nature? One place in the environment going forward, more labor shortages, etc. Are you guys just putting out the fires or have you considered how to restore this long-term bridge? Thank you.\nDavid Fallon: Yeah. Andrew. Like a lot of things, very much dependent upon pricing, which we feel very good. That is sticking. And I think the focus instead of looking at 2021 or 2022 midpoint is to look at the adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter, which is 15%. And as we discussed with Lance, it's not fair to just annualize that from a operating margin perspective into 2023, but it's a great start. And we would say we would be right back on track where our plans were, let's say, six months ago with our -- with the timing of getting the near-term adjusted operating margin up to 16%. So I would say as we exit 2022, I would say things are back to normal and even to a certain extent, maybe a little bit more accelerated than where we thought especially with E&I adjusted operating margin also returning to the levels that we expect it.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: Thank you for the call out. Just clarification, slide 13, just understanding 110% of pricing in the first half versus a 120%, 130% in Q3, Q4. It's just -- I'm just -- I don't quite understand how a year-over-year comps for it because well, right. Because it's sort of a weak comp of an easy comp and then we have a strong comp of strong comps in the second half, maybe I missed something on the call, I apologize for that but just to understand why it's only a 110% in the first half, given that the comps are low or given that we got 130% and 120% in Q3 and Q4, respectively. Thank you.\nDavid Fallon: Great question, Andrew. The biggest dynamic there is addressed on Slide 14 at the bottom. The pricing is driven by what we're able to sell out of backlog, and based on what we're able to sell on a book and ship basis. And the pricing that we get for book and ship deliveries is certainly higher than what's in the backlog. The dynamic there, it's $110 million in the first half and much higher in the second half, is directly driven by the amount of sales that come out of backlog in the first half and the amount of sales that come from book and ship in the second half.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: And so that implies that there was a lot of more book-and-ship in Q3 and Q4. And now, we're just shipping out of backlog? Is that just as in-flight financial? I'm sorry.\nDavid Fallon: Yeah. When we progress through 2022, specifically for Q3, 70% of the sales that we anticipate in Q3 will be based on new orders placed in 2022, which will be at a price point much higher than those coming from backlog and there's still about 30% of our sales in Q3, which will be based out of the 12, 31, 21 backlog. But you can see that sequentially improves as we go through the year. And as important, I think Q4, we still have 25% of our sales that are based on orders that were in the backlog at the end of '21. If you progress the 2023, almost 95% of our sales in 2023, are going to be based on this higher pricing that we get, not only in 2022, but also in 2023.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: Got you. Thanks so much.\nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks.\nRobert Johnson: Sure, again, I want to apologize to all you for our Q4 performance. As you know, we're not happy, you're not happy with it. We have a handle on the issues. I hope you saw that through our presentation today, and need to prove it to you throughout this year. We will earn your trust back. I want to thank you. And have a good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. First turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results, which certainly felt short of our external guidance across most of these financial metrics versus last year sales were up a $105 million or 8%, 4% organic when adjusted for the $67 million of sales from E&I and we also had a $13 million foreign exchange headwind. Our fourth quarter top-line, as Rob mentioned, continued to be negatively affected by challenges with procuring parts. As the underlying market demand certainly was much stronger than implied in this year-over-year sales growth, with orders up over 50% compared to last year's fourth quarter. And it's definitely seen with our record high backlog at year-end Without the supply chain constraints and this is a little bit hypothetical, conceptual, our sales growth percentage would have easily been in the double-digits for the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating profit of $94 million fell significantly short of our external guide, and it was primarily driven, if not entirely, by contribution margin, which will summarize in a separate slide in a short bit. On this slide, we captured the drivers of the $58 million reduction in adjusted operating profit from last year's fourth quarter, including $80 million lower contribution margin, which was primarily driven by a $60 million headwind from price cost. Approximately $90 million of material and freight inflation only partially offset by $30 million of incremental pricing. And of note that our pricing was actually relatively consistent with our external guide. As we will discuss with 2022 guidance, we've addressed the $60 million fourth quarter and $135 -- the $60 million fourth quarter, $135 million full-year 2021 price cost and balanced with aggressive price actions taken in the fourth quarter and early 2022. Returning the fourth quarter adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS drop consistent with the adjusted operating profit decline. With adjusted operating margin about 500 basis points lower and adjusted EPS about $0.25 lower than last year's fourth quarter. And finally on this page, fourth-quarter free cash flow was significantly lower than prior year, primarily driven by the lower adjusted operating profit. But also timing of working capital, and about $30 million of cash M&A expenses. Turning to Page 8, this slide summarizes our fourth-quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to be more impacted by supply chain challenges than the other two regions. The supply chain challenges negatively affected both America's top and bottom line. With organic net sales up just $7 million or around 1% against a very strong regional market demand backdrop where orders were more than two times last year's fourth quarter. The left-hand chart at the bottom of the page shows the $69 million year-over-year decline in adjusted operating profit in the Americas. Of course, heavily influenced by price cost. Approximately 70% to 75% of the overall [Indiscernible] price cost headwind for 2021, and in the fourth quarter is in the Americas despite the Americas representing less than 45% of total sales. Freight inflation was particularly acute in the fourth-quarter and accelerated significantly in the U.S. as we progress through the end of the year. Of course, in response to disproportionate net inflation in the Americas, our fourth quarter and 2022 pricing responses have also been much stronger in that region. All things considered APAC posted relatively good results in the fourth quarter with organic sales up almost 3% and adjusted operating profit and margin relatively flat with last year, although not completely immune from the current supply chain, challenges, relatively little of our 2021 net price cost headwind came from APAC. And finally on this slide, moving to the right EMEA showed strong fourth quarter top-line growth with organic sales up 11% however, margins were down about a 130 basis points from last year as the leverage benefit from these higher sales was more than offset by a price cost headwind. Next, turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges fourth quarter adjusted operating profit from our $176 million guidance to the $94 million actual and $82 million negative variance. $46 million of this variance was due to higher-than-expected material freight and labor inflation primarily in the America and especially concentrated on freight, including premium freight for both inbound and outbound shipments to protect customer deliveries, but also due to an increase in standard over the road rates, which were up over 30% from last year's fourth quarter. As we will discuss shortly, our 2022 guidance assumes that these fourth-quarter inflationary headwinds continue and trend even higher in 2022, moving to the right, we incurred approximately $10 million more than an expected sales commission expense in the fourth quarter, primarily due to strong fourth quarter orders up over 50% from last year's fourth quarter. E&I, as Rob mentioned, came in short of expectations in the fourth quarter and volume for overall Vertiv's -- base Vertiv was lower than expected due to the parts availability that we discussed. And finally, on this page, pricing was materially in line with our fourth quarter expectations off about $2 million, but they approximately $53 million that pricing we realized in 2021 has been sticking. And as we will review in a few moments, it is expected to accelerate significantly as we progress through 2022. Next, turning to Slide 10, this page summarizes our full-year 2021 results versus prior year. We won't spend a lot of time on this slide as I'm sure everyone is anxious to understand what we see going forward in 2022, but to summarize 2021, despite the supply chain constraints, we grew our top-line organically by about 11%, which likely would've been over 15% without the supply challenges. Our adjusted operating profit and margin were significantly affected by negative net price costs with almost $190 million of material and freight inflation, only partially offset by $53 million of pricing. Although more aggressive pricing actions were taken at the end of 2021 than implied with the $53 million full-year number realization in our income statement was certainly influenced by our significant backlog, which drive the timing lag between inflation and offsetting price hitting our PNL. We certainly expect pricing to catch up with costs in 2022. And finally on this page, full-year 2021 free cash flow was about $27 million lower than last year with a $92 million cash interest benefit from debt restructuring, more offset by an inventory build. Cash M&A expenses in higher capex and cash taxes. Now, flipping a couple of slides, we transition from 2021 actuals to 2022 guidance beginning with Slide 12. But before we dive in, you will see that we supply a lot of detail within our 2022 guidance, including first-half, second-half, and quarterly breakouts for expected sales adjusted operating profit, and also pricing and inflation. We are providing this detail because we realize -- absolutely realized we have likely damaged some of our credibility in 2021, notably with the quality of our external guidance. And we want to be fully transparent with you with how we see the year unfolding. It is impossible to understand the dynamics within 2022 with looking at only full-year figures. And as you will see, our anticipated second half of 2022 is much different and much improved from the first half. And each quarter improved sequentially from the previous quarter. This expected improvement both in the second half and with each successive quarter, is driven by accelerating price cost benefit versus 2021. Of course, we understand that providing this level of detail likely creates the expectation for us to supply the same level of details we've progress through the year. And we were absolutely prepared to do that and we will update our assumptions and projections for all inputs as appropriate. And we know that you'll track with us every step of the way. So with that said, finally, getting to the content on Slide 12, this page summarizes our broad expectations for 2022 by splitting our guidance between first and second half. We expect first half to continue to be challenged by parts availability with underlying organic volume when you remove price to be down 5% year-over-year. Despite the record year-end backlog as we do not see significant supply chain constraints lessening at all in the first half of '22 versus what we saw at the end of 2021. In addition, although price costs recovers as we exit the second quarter, it is still projected to be upside down by approximately $70 million for the full first half. The second half is a much different story as we expect financial performance to improve significantly from the first half, we assume 6% higher organic volume. Once again, excluding price and part of that is based on a greater visibility to allocation of parts in the second half. And this second percent higher organic volume and -- could be conservative based upon our backlog and the end market demand. But once again, the underlying driver of improved sales performance in the second half is pricing. Based upon pricing actions that we have already taken; we expect $250 million of incremental year-over-year pricing in the second half alone. And as a result, price cost is expected to be a positive $170 million in the second half. Significantly improve in adjusted operating profit, with adjusted operating margin increasing to 14%. Our expectations for a strong second-half pertains, a strong 2023 as we capture additional year-over-year pricing from actions already taken, as virtually all sales in 2023 will be at the higher pricing. While we have significant sales in 2022, as we mentioned, from our existing backlog at lower historical pricing levels and will further explain this dynamic and a couple of slides. But let's move on to slide 13. This is another slice of our guidance going from a first-half, second-half perspective to a quarterly perspective. Net sales adjusted operating profit, and adjusted operating margins are all projected to sequentially increase as we progress through the year. And as we mentioned on the prior slide, the primary driver of this sequentially improving financial performance is the timing of price realization. The chart at the bottom left illustrates the quarterly profitability trend for both 2021 and 2022. Our price cost issues began in the third quarter of 2021 and we anticipate them to be addressed after the second quarter of this year. So we're almost three quarters of our way through what we see is a fourth quarter issue. As price costs turns positive for each of the last two quarters of 2022. Finally, on this page, the chart at the upper right shows the relatively conservative volume assumptions inherent in the plan. With full-year organic volume, once again, excluding pricing, assume to increase just 1% as we do not assume significantly improving parts availability as we progress through the year. And we will continuously assess that assumption, as we go forward. Next, turning to Slide 14, this page details our year-over-year quarterly price costs or net inflation assumptions for 2022. For the full year, we expect to generate $100 million favorable year-over-year price costs, including the assumption of $360 million of price offset by $260 million of incremental inflation. As discussed in the prior slides, our quarterly pricing increases sequentially as the proportion of sales from existing backlog declines as you can see in the chart at the bottom of the page. Also very important, we should have significant carryover price benefit into 2023 as we expect 95% of next year sales to be at the higher pricing levels. While in 2022, only 50% were, and this drives in an expectation for about $200 million of carryover pricing impact for 2023. Now from an inflation perspective, we assume that what we experienced exiting 2021 will continue through full-year 2022. That's an approximately $160 million year-over-year carryover negative impact. But in addition, we have assumed $100 million of new inflation in 2022. 20 -- as Rob mentioned, 2021 actual inflation outpaced our expectations, each step of the way, and we believe it prudent to assume that inflation will continue to worsen in 2022, which drives the $100 million incremental assumption. And we definitely will reevaluate this new inflation assumption as we progress through 2022. Now based on the foregoing assumptions, we expect price cost to be neutral in the second quarter, and as mentioned, significantly favorable for the second half beginning in the third quarter. Next, turning to Slide 15, this page supplies some color on our confidence that the $360 million pricing number for 2022 is achievable and will stick. The first as we saw in the previous page, the first $125 million of the $360 is actually included in our year-end backlog. So we risk assess that from highly probable to certain. Now the second $235 million is based on pricing projections in new 2022 orders that will book and shift within the year. Based upon the market acceptance of our fourth quarter price increase, evidenced by the 51% increase in orders. We certainly saw the opportunity to be much more aggressive with 2022 pricing. In late 2021 and early 2022, we initiated multiple waves of list price increases. And this is across all product lines in all regions. Although we certainly were a bit more aggressive in both the Americas and EMEA, where inflation has been more pronounced. Based upon our order rates, so far in January and February, which are in line or even a little bit higher than last year's order rates for that same period. It appears that our higher pricing is sticking in this high demand, short supply market environment. Of course, we will continue to reevaluate this assumption and reassess our pricing as we progress through the year. As we have mentioned many times, we believe we operate in a great position in a good industry. Data center demand for our equipment, and more importantly, our technology is not abating anytime soon and it should continue to accelerate going forward. With the backdrop of rising global costs. In this long-term market demand, we believe our price increases are justifiable, reasonable and achievable. But in fact, one lesson learned as we manage price increases over the last nine months or so, is that we have historically underestimated our ability to get price. And based upon the success of our recent price actions, we have absolute confidence that we will be able to drive consistent price increases going forward. Turning to Slide 16, this page summarizes our full-year 2022 financial guidance. We provide added detail in the appendix to aid analysts and investors with modeling. Overall, we expect 13% top-line growth, 8% organic. Components of this organic growth are 7% price and 1% volume, as our assumption is that the supply chain constraints do not significantly ease in 2022 and only in the fourth quarter if at all, we will continue to reassess this possibly conservative assumption as we go through the year, full-year adjusted operating profit is expected to increase $54 million or 11%. With base Vertiv relatively flat, and most of the increase coming from net acquisitions and divestitures, there is an $85 million a year-over-year increase in fixed costs. And we provide some additional color on that increase in the appendix. As we showed in prior slides, quarterly adjusted operating profit and margin increased sequentially with higher pricing. With fourth quarter operating profit projected to be $255 million. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin expected to be $0.15. And fourth quarter. adjust EPS to exceed $0.40 a share. So even though full-year financial metrics are not overly impressive, we should be exiting 2022 in a very good position. Finally, on this page, we summarize both adjusted EPS and free cash flow for 2022, and once again, we supply underlying assumptions for each in the appendix. Now turning to Slide 17, this page summarizes our first quarter financial guidance. As we previewed in prior slides, our performance in the first quarter will continue to be challenged by negative price cost, about $70 million in the quarter and supply chain constraints will unfavorably affect year-over-year organic volume. We estimate by about $45 million. Now, the net impact is not great as shown by the expected $20 million adjusted operating loss. But these first quarter results should be the net year for our quarterly financial performance, as we project consistent quarterly improvement as we go through 2022 based on actions we have already initiated, including by delivering $360 million of higher pricing for full-year 2022, but also pricing actions should deliver an additional carryover impact of $200 million into 2023. Now with that said, I turn it back over to Rob. When we got the December results. That's where all of a sudden everything seemed to crash. And we didn't really know all the details of it till we got to the latter part of January and spent a good part of February trying to figure out what the heck was going on and what we had to do. And Rob and I got significantly more involved with what did we have to do to resolve the cultural issues that did exist in the America s, and that's been addressed. When it came to inflation, it was clear we had been under forecasting what was going to happen with inflation. And I would argue some of that was a cultural issue, also, which we have addressed. No. I think those are fair comments, Dave. I think they are fair comments. Thank you. Good morning, Nicole. I 100% agree with your -- your comments. Rob and Nicole oftentimes when it comes to forecasting, it's a lot of blocking and tackling. And I would say we have instituted a lot of rigor in the last 60 days. Specifically, around the Americas ' forecasting process to the extent that last Thursday, both Rob and I were effectively in and out of a meeting that lasted from 9:00 AM in the morning to 10:00 PM at night. And so we're putting a lot of diligence into this and we understand our credibility was harmed as it related to forecasting. And we will not let that happen again. And we're confident with the steps and processes we put together for that specific issue. Yeah, Nicole so the order rate percentages are all without E&I because we haven't tried to approximate what orders were or would've been in the fourth quarter of 2020. So that order rate is all excluding ENI. But if you look at the backlog, the $3.2 billion of backlog that does include the ENI, and I think ENI is just a little bit short of $300 million at year-end. So the base Vertiv backlog is somewhere between $2.9 and $3 billion. Yeah. Yeah. The -- monitor, I guess is not a strong enough word. And I will -- I'll leave it to Dave and Rob to use whatever strong word is required, but they're going to be much more involved in understanding did the reconciliation work the way it was supposed to. As to having the team figure it out, and the approach that we took, this is a tool that I generally use, and I've talked about in the past, because you can't have the CEO always having to tell people just work together. They have to do it, they have to recognize the problem, and they have to fix the processes themselves, and have to come up with, here's how we're going to do it going forward. And it starts with, they got to recognize they have a problem, which they have done. And the fixes that they've developed didn't just fix what we had as the current forecast, but it's going to get fixed going forward. And like with any new process, you don't just set it up and walk away. You still have to monitor, or use a stronger word, be involved to understand that it's happening. And I can assure you, both Rob and Dave are committed to making sure that that happens that way. Yes, thanks Jeff, this is David, so I would say our guide for 2022, it's certainly uninspiring. I think $150 million. There are some elements of that guide that might be one-off. So for example, our capex for 2022 is projected to be about $130 million. That's probably a little bit elevated, number one, some of the 21 capex split into 22, but we do have some capacity expansion dollars in there as well. I would say a more normalized capex number, on an annual basis is probably around a $100 million or so. So that's one element. The number one driver of the free cash flow, in the long-term is going to be the EBITDA. And the full year EBITDA is certainly not what it should be for 2022, but if you look at what we're going to do in the second half, notably in Q4, you annualize that, that is going to be a direct contributor to much higher free cash flow. And I think our guidance at the beginning of '21 was $285 million. I would say, based on where we are, especially after the pricing increases go through, our run rate should be much higher than that. It's a little bit of a hypothetical but our overall goal is to get a 100% of free cash flow and the conversion on that income. The other thing I would add, Jeff for Mr. Sprague is that if U -- AOP is a good indicator, I think of operating cash flow. And if you take a look at our fourth-quarter run rate, and then the $200 million of price carryover in 23 that Dave referenced earlier, that puts us in a very good AOP position. That is the biggest driver of what free cash flow will be. Yeah. Thanks Mark. This is David and I think it really is a combination of all the things you mentioned. I would not be completely honest if I said that there is an element of conservatism included in that. And that's based on our lessons from last year. Every time we put a [Indiscernible] in the ground. As it relates -- related to inflation, it got worse. And we saw that, especially in the Americas as we progress through the year. And most notably in EMEA, as we exited the year. So there is a provision per conservatism, but certainly a part of that $100 million is based on what we're seeing currently, so it would be hard for me to handicap a specific dollar for what we're seeing and how much it is conservatism, but that's something that we will better be able to reassess as we go through the year and we can provide an update on that at the end of the first quarter. We've actually -- there are -- there is some good news out there, notably, with some of the commodity prices, and in particular, with steel in the U.S. Our pricing for steel, which is our most prevalent commodity, the -- is indexed based on an average price of the quarter before. And steel prices have come down fairly nicely since the mid fourth quarter. We've seen some of that benefit in our Q1 pricing. But if the lower steel prices hold through the end of Q1, we should definitely see a benefit in Q2. We have not built into any of our forecast. Any -- in any specific component or commodity improving this year. So that would be an excellent example of a specific piece of conservatism built into our forecasting. I -- there's likely some seasonality in Q4 projections for 2022, but not nearly what we normally would have. I would say, Q4 is certainly a better run rate projection for 2023. With that said, Q1 2023 is probably going to be lower than Q4 2022, but it's a lot easier to annualize that Q4 2022 number than it would be to do that in any other year. And that's because we are assuming continual -- our continued supply constraint in that number. And of course, we're hopeful that some of that actually gets rectified as we enter the second half. Yeah, I certainly can address from a Vertiv perspective. We look at alternative uses for our cash on a continuous basis. Certainly, based on the stock reaction today. A stock buyback would definitely the more attractive than it was yesterday. So it's not making any commitments whatsoever, but it is something that we would strategically evaluate. Yes. On the last one, no issues on any covenants. I think there's one covenant within the ABL. It's fixed charge coverage ratio and we have ample room for that, that will not be initiative this year. As it relates to use of cash -- and maybe 2021 was the exception, but we generally have our lowest free cash flow in Q1, we had positive free cash flow last year. This year, we will definitely use cash so similar to the financial projections, the free cash flow should progressively improve as we go through the year as well. I would say sometime probably early third quarter would be the bottom point as it relates to liquidity. We do have as we mentioned, we resolve the tax receivable agreement. There's a $50 million payment at the end of June and the September. I think soon after that $50 million payment at the end of the June would be the bottom part. With the -- I'm sorry, the bottom of our liquidity and then it should improve thereafter. Yes, thanks, Lance. Steve. As we think about it, we look at each order when it comes in, and it's not just a blanket order for this many units. Our orders are specific sites, specific jobs, specific locations where they need to go. That gives us confidence. And this question has been asked over the last couple of years of, as the backlog increases or as the order rate increases, our people double and triple ordering. We don't believe that's the case whatsoever, that people just put in blanket orders just to cover themselves. Yeah. Andrew. Like a lot of things, very much dependent upon pricing, which we feel very good. That is sticking. And I think the focus instead of looking at 2021 or 2022 midpoint is to look at the adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter, which is 15%. And as we discussed with Lance, it's not fair to just annualize that from a operating margin perspective into 2023, but it's a great start. And we would say we would be right back on track where our plans were, let's say, six months ago with our -- with the timing of getting the near-term adjusted operating margin up to 16%. So I would say as we exit 2022, I would say things are back to normal and even to a certain extent, maybe a little bit more accelerated than where we thought especially with E&I adjusted operating margin also returning to the levels that we expect it.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: Thank you for the call out. Just clarification, slide 13, just understanding 110% of pricing in the first half versus a 120%, 130% in Q3, Q4. It's just -- I'm just -- I don't quite understand how a year-over-year comps for it because well, right. Because it's sort of a weak comp of an easy comp and then we have a strong comp of strong comps in the second half, maybe I missed something on the call, I apologize for that but just to understand why it's only a 110% in the first half, given that the comps are low or given that we got 130% and 120% in Q3 and Q4, respectively. Thank you. Great question, Andrew. The biggest dynamic there is addressed on Slide 14 at the bottom. The pricing is driven by what we're able to sell out of backlog, and based on what we're able to sell on a book and ship basis. And the pricing that we get for book and ship deliveries is certainly higher than what's in the backlog. The dynamic there, it's $110 million in the first half and much higher in the second half, is directly driven by the amount of sales that come out of backlog in the first half and the amount of sales that come from book and ship in the second half.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: And so that implies that there was a lot of more book-and-ship in Q3 and Q4. And now, we're just shipping out of backlog? Is that just as in-flight financial? I'm sorry. Yeah. When we progress through 2022, specifically for Q3, 70% of the sales that we anticipate in Q3 will be based on new orders placed in 2022, which will be at a price point much higher than those coming from backlog and there's still about 30% of our sales in Q3, which will be based out of the 12, 31, 21 backlog. But you can see that sequentially improves as we go through the year. And as important, I think Q4, we still have 25% of our sales that are based on orders that were in the backlog at the end of '21. If you progress the 2023, almost 95% of our sales in 2023, are going to be based on this higher pricing that we get, not only in 2022, but also in 2023.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: Got you. Thanks so much. Thanks, Andrew."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Robert Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, the management team and I share the year sentiment about our Q4 results and the outlook for the first half of 2022. But before diving into the key messages on the first slide, let me comment on two topics. First, while Dave has been a good mentor to me over the last two years, our relationship is certainly evolved over the past 60 to 90 days. As is opening comments suggests, he has become much more actively involved in the day-to-day aspects of the business, both on the cost and price side, he is helping me almost daily basis to conduct reviews with our teams and host other business topics. And is my full expectation that this level of involvement will continue through 2022. Secondly, let me address our guidance miss in the fourth quarter for which I take full Responsibility for. In short, we screwed up and some of you undoubtedly are wondering how we could get so surprised. We significantly underestimated the magnitude of the material and freight inflation in the fourth quarter forecast mostly in America, by approximately $36 million. This underestimation cost also contributed to our underpricing in the market in 2021. So it was a huge deal not only for costs, but also price. Half of the inflation miss was related to unforeseen supplier de -commits on critical components and our need to execute spot buys and premium freight to meet customer commitments. The other half is related to forecasting issue within America's region, heavily influenced by our ERP implementation. But also, due to forecasting process issues within the region. These regional costs, forecasting issues have been fixed, and we feel very confident with our cost projections for 2022 as evidenced by our January costs being lower than what we were planning. And that is why we're comfortable with what we have that we have it all carryout. In addition, based upon better understanding of our underlying cost, we have been extremely aggressive with pricing than last 90 days or so. As you will see in today's presentation. To more than offset the higher costs. With this, better understanding of cost and higher pricing, which we're seeing in our year-to-date orders. We're confident that we will deliver strong financial results in the second half of 2022 and beyond. Now, turning to the key messages, on-demand, Vertiv products and services is very strong. Our organic sales were up 4% from Q4 of 2020. The strength of our position in the market can be validated by our order rate, which was up over 50% in Q4 over last year. And has pushed the total Vertiv's backlog to over $3.2 billion. Two, profitability challenge primarily driven because of inflationary headwinds, not because of a flawed strategy, or a decreasing demand for our products and services, but due specifically to inflation, that companies everywhere are battling. our fourth quarter adjusted operating profit was $94 million, which unfortunate was $58 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. We felt inflationary pressures most severely in Americas, but also across our other regions. Our pricing actions increased as the year went on, but they were exceeded by inflationary costs and created $135 million net headwind. We continue to raise price at aggressive rate even as recently as last month, and we will continue to do so to make sure we get ahead of inflation. As you know, and fortunately, we are carrying a large backlog and it takes quarters for that pricing to be fully realized. Fourth, we don't see the full impact of our pricing actions in the first half of 2022 but those actions will kick in during the second half and we expect the second half adjusted operating profit to be approximately $455 million, $230 million over the second half of 2021. Supply chain issues are real and challenging, delaying product completion. The verdict team is battling parts on a daily basis. Our biggest challenge is with electro -mechanical parts and fans. Critical components of many of our verdict products. Internally, we have launched counter measures to address the shortages. However, we expect and have been prepared for supply chain pressures to continue for the majority of 2022. Final and most important key message, although 2021 did not produce the results we expected for reasons I just shared. Vertiv is now well-positioned for strong performance in the second half of 2022 and into 2023 due to our aggressive pricing actions in Q4 and early 2022. Turning to Slide 4, recapping our 2021 performance, and then I'll provide some additional detail, what's playing out for 2022. With regard to 2021, we continue to have strong demand for our products. Some of this demand is because we are in a strong growing market. Some is because we are winning with our go-to-market strategies, and some is a result of our Vertiv product development efforts. These three reasons are giving us an order rate that's almost up 30% year-over-year and over 50%, as I mentioned earlier, in fourth quarter. Admittedly, we believe the significant order growth rate in quarter four is an indicator that we could have priced even more aggressively. And adding further confidence that our pricing actions over the next several months are appropriate, and will be received in the market. But a good portion of our $3.2 billion backlog will ship in 2022. Right now, we're getting visibility in the customer plans for 2023 and beyond. This visibility is being provided in the form of forecast, purchase orders providing us greater visibility to our revenue profile. Not only over the next several quarters, but into the future. On the 2021 supply side, we fully expect to be challenged for most of the year. Critical parts availability is spotty and despite all the efforts to qualify second and third sources and redesigned products where possible. We know part shortages or something our industry will grapple with throughout the year. In addition, 2021 inflation got ahead of our pricing just when we thought we had budgeted enough price, inflation got worse. This happened several times. We have corrected it now and are being very conservative in our expectations that inflation will not go away in 2022. The acquisition of ENI closed in November. Integration efforts are in full swing. We remain more confident than ever in our purchase decision. Vertiv will reap the benefits from this complementary nature of ENI's process and products and its ability to be accretive platform from Vertiv's long into the future. And 2021, we invested significantly in ERD just as we planned, we launched several new and innovative products and evidenced by their order rates, these products have exceeded expectations of our acceptance from the market, allowing us to take share in certain categories. In 2021 we invested in ERD of fundamental part of our long-term growth strategy. Now as we turn to 2022 outlook. Our demand environment remained strong, but deliveries remain constrained by part shortages, especially in the semiconductors and electro -mechanical parts that I discussed earlier. We aren't planning to see meaningful improvement in the supply chain this year. We have new production capacity coming online in America's to support our growing thermal business. We are anticipating material and freight costs will continue to increase, but our incremental pricing actions are expected to materially offset 2021 and 2022 inflation by the end of 2022. Pricing realization accelerates throughout '20 to '22 and provide a net price cost tailwind by Q3. We expect profit in the first half of 2022 will remain challenged, but will market re-improve in the second half of the year as price cost turns positive. Due to the pricing actions already initiated, we expect to exit 2022 in a good position. Turning to Slide 5, this is the chart we used to illustrate what we're seeing in the market in each of our regions and each of our end markets. And the cloud and hyper scale markets, they remained strong, represented by Green Buttons in America and EMEA. In APAC however, we see some slowdown as China is pushing cloud and hyper scale companies to maximize our existing facilities. We expect this to be a short-term phenomenon. When looking at our collocation customers, we're not only seeing strength across the regions, but increasing strength in Americas and EMEA. Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 colors are building out data centers to serve their customers. And we are participating in a very healthy way with the building out efforts. Our enterprise, small and medium business markets remained constant for Q4 to Q1. we're experiencing good performance in each region. The pipeline is growing and America is leading the way. The communication network market remains consistently strong with an uptick in Americas as 5G deployment continue to accelerate. The commercial industrial market, things remain a consistent in EMEA and APAC. And we did see an uptick in Americas allowing us to upgrade Americas from yellow to green. While the commercial and industrial market is a smaller slice of our business, the variety of products and services we sell in this market continues to grow. Moving to Slide 6, we closed the E&I acquisition on November 1st, and the integration team has been hard at work ever since. E&I has also faced, and is facing supply constraints and inflation, which is temporarily affected the top and bottom line. E&I has a very healthy backlog. We believe the pricing actions that we've taken in Q4 and will continue to be taken as needed, will be realized in the back half of '22 with E&I as well. We anticipate 2022 revenue from E&I alone to come in around $470 million with an adjusted operating profit of $80 million. Customer reactions to the deal have been nothing short of fantastic. And this acquisition has increased our relevancy with our customers. We expect as 2022 progresses, the synergistic leverage we will get from ENI will enhance our performance in 2023 and beyond. So I might summarize ENI in 2022 as a tough year, but still a great deal. Now I will turn it over to David to walk through the financials. David. Thanks, David. Now let's turn to slide 18. I know this quarter's earnings report is not what you expected from us and is not what we expected from ourselves. We got caught up in supply chain challenges that reflects most of the world and we did not appropriately anticipate inflationary pressures, we would experience as we tried to obtain parts, we needed to manufacture our products. We have a great position in a good industry. We have world-class products and service offerings. We have a talented team. We are relevant to our customers. We are cultivating our relationships, and we are investing in our future. And we have a clear line of sight to our margin expansion goals. While I'm extremely disappointed in our performance in Q4, I'm confident in our ability to deliver on our 2022 commitments and how the new actions we have taken have set us up to deliver a very impressive 2023. In the end, our success for 2022 and beyond is highly dependent on our ability to deliver pricing commitments that we have communicated today. And I have the confidence that we'll be able to deliver that. I take personal responsibility for this to. To Vertiv employees around the world. Thank you for the work you've done and continue to do. And the support you provided me to each other and to our customers. With that said, I want to thank all of you for listening today, and I will now turn the call over to the operator who will open up the line for questions. No, so to be clear, are they're not paid to book unprofitable business. We actually have an unruly instituted over the last 60, 90 days, even tighter controls, so they don't have the ability, just a discount to grow the backlog and grow the business. We have a very tight, rigorous process that goes all the way up to certain levels and including myself, depending on what discounts are trying to do. So we hold that tight from that perspective, so that they don't have the freedom to just discount, to build backlog or to go book orders. And in different parts of the world, we have profitability as part of the overall sales compensation. So again, the answer would be no, they're not paid to book unprofitable business. Yes. So a couple of things I'd have to say here, kind of said in my opening comments, we did have some issues upfront with our ERP and Americas. To be clear, we didn't see the rate of inflation that we're actually experiencing till later in the quarter and the later month. We did however see an increase in spot buys and expedited freight in order to counter supplier decommit. So when we came out in our last earnings call, supply for us with certain suppliers, with our products actually got worse and de -commits happened and accelerated throughout the quarter. So it really wasn't necessarily, I would say a cultural issue as more of a system issue and our ability to see that as we changed over ERP. And secondly, we consciously made decisions to pay expedited freight and drive spot buys in order to counter the de -commits from our suppliers. I'll address some of the culture issues upfront. Dave, can talk a little bit about -- and I'll talk a little bit about the planning process and Dave can come in over the top. As it relates to cultural issues. Again, the organization probably -- not probably, organization didn't and wasn't set up to drive a lot of price previous years, we've shown $20, $25 million in price. And what we really had to do really top down. Dave, myself, and others in the management team is really drive all the way down to the sales people. What it means to get price, how to get price, and not to be afraid to lose orders as we go through that. So that's something culturally losing orders with something that we had to overcome and say, it's okay from the perspective of, we've got to go drive price. And it's proven out that that works and that we were able to get price as Dave mentioned, probably should have and could have got more price in Q4 and Americas with the order backlog that we saw, the other cultural issue that they talked about is really the FIOP process for Americas, and really having that tighter pulled together so that the demand and the supply and those constraints, we're working closely together, coupled by an exacerbation of that, of a new ERP system that came in that we had lack of visibility for a period of time which has now since then fixed from that perspective. So it's on the culture side and then on the process side, we are well beyond the implementation of our ERP as it relates to and by evidence of January's results, we have visibility into what our PPV is and our price purchase variances and have a good handle on what inflation's looking like. So we were behind throughout the quarter, as Dave mentioned, got into December, recognize what was going on and have implemented both process changes as I talked earlier on pricing levels of approval, as well as a process levels with the integration of Americas, operations and supply and sales, and any other comments, David Fallon or David Cote? Hi Jeff. This is Rob. A couple, a couple of things, comments and others can chime in. It's because the teams aren't left to just go figure it out on their own. Combination of myself, Dave Cote being involved and Dave Fallon have given strict marching orders or what needs to happen. They need to make it happen. So it's not, they go figure it out and come report out to us. We have given specific instructions as to what they need to do, what needs to happen, guess what Dave is saying is they need to drive that, make that happen, we will monitor that, but no doubt that from top down, we're driving that message to the team, the three of us. Secondly, on the ERP system, as you know, all the ERP systems are difficult in their own ways and in this particular one, while things went cut-over, we were able to continue to ship and do the basic business functions that you'd expect to do that some people get caught up. We didn't have that problem. It was more of an understanding of the price variance and things that we didn't get to later on. We've since then fixed that as any ERP system, you do have things you fixed after the launch. And that's where we got caught up and kind of got behind on the visibility and then begin to better understand that as we got into December and really towards the end of January, and it took us a little bit longer to assess where we were at and making sure that we now understand our PPV. Any other comments from Dave Cote or Dave Fallon? Hey, this is Rob, a couple of things there as it relates to getting price and getting that in the contracts, there is a couple of things we've changed to is getting that price, but also putting escalators in there if commodities change outside a certain boundary. So that's something we have done and put into the contracts. It wasn't in all of our contracts prior, so we're looking at we can never predict where it's going to go and we believe what David just said, but I would say as a backstop, the ability to get additional price, if necessary, if things continue beyond a threshold from that perspective. As it relates to supply, I mentioned earlier in my discussion was, we've done a few things, we're not just sitting here saying how we can't get it. We've either qualified additional suppliers, we've modified, or re-engineered certain parts and allowed for additional supply base to help us out. So as it relates to, we keep continue to talk about fans being a problem with qualified additional vendors there and also have changed some of the design there that uncouples it from maybe some of the constraints that we have. So we look at that, whether it's displays, whether it's qualifying additional IGBTs vendors, which is a big part of our power conversion products and the DC power, one of the things you'll see from us is that from a IGBT perspective, which is the power conversion, we have a DC power business that most of our competitors don't. We buy a significant amount of those. So getting additional supply base, additional suppliers. And a lot of this got started even pre all of this inflationary and supply constraint. It was really as COVID hit, and it taught us a lesson to qualify and drive additional suppliers. And we'll continue to do that, even as, hopefully at some point in time, who knows when inflation goes in the -- we have deflation in the other direction. Our strategy is still to make sure that we have multiple suppliers all the way down through our design process so that we don't single source. And those fires aren't just in one particular region, they have multiple regions because we've learned that, while I may have multiple suppliers and they might be fan vendors out of Germany, that could cause a problem. I need to have supply base in different parts of the region. Nigel, thanks for the question. This is Rob. I'll answer the first two and then David Fallon can come over on the third one. As I mentioned earlier, some of the behavioral changes that we've put in place across the world is really authority and approval. One of the quickest ways to get there is stop discounting. We've raised these prices appropriately, but you can lose price through discounting. We've changed those thresholds across the globe. We've changed the level in which those decisions can be made all the way up to myself and David as CFO so that we don't give away the pricing that we were getting through discounting. So that is a I'd call it a cultural thing and a change that we implemented over the over the last 60, 90 days. And we believe that very effective, although painful for the organization, it's the right thing to do to guarantee that we get this price. Could you take a look at specifically Americas, what the dynamic that's going on there and our market overall is -- it's a [Indiscernible], constraint in general, lead times have gone out for whether it's generators, whether it's breakers, whatever it might be. And I think what we saw is -- and what we'll continue to see is people are putting orders and to get their slots to make sure they get supply where that used to be maybe they order 6 months ahead, 3 months ahead. In some cases, they're ordering and looking at 12, maybe 18 months as we go forward. The demand is extremely strong on a global basis, and that's why you're seeing that uptick overall. It wasn't a rush to get it before price because of a lot of that had pricing actions that were taken in November, back in October or September, and then more recently in December. The strength for us really comes from -- a lot around the Colo Cloud, but also even in the channel. We've seen growth as we continue to increase price there. We continue to see growth around the Vertiv product offering. David on the third one? Or Gary. Thanks Andrew. Good afternoon, Steve. Steve, this is Rob. Thanks for the question. Traditionally, I think culturally you may have heard earlier, we didn't think -- David said, we didn't think as a company we could go out and be strong with a price. But what I really see is happening, where we're getting prices, where we're differentiating, where we're developing, call them unique or innovative products and solutions. And the organization -- you're absolutely right. The industry culturally hasn't gone there because a lot of areas haven't been providing innovation. So where we have innovated in certain areas, like thermal management and so forth, those are areas that we found on learns to this. So we can actually get price and continue to get price for innovation. And that's the basis of our thesis. And reason we've been driving our R&D up is, fundamentally, we believe with innovation providing stronger products with customers we can get that price, we can get a higher price than those that aren't innovating in those section and as you may know, we don't compete, I know lot of people think it's just the big guys that are part of big conglomerates. We compete with a lot of locals that you wouldn't know that don't report out. And those also are experiencing these commodity are specific price cost issues as well. So we have seen people follow and we look at the different parts of the market. And as we've gone to it, what we found is we're Vertiv products are preferred where we have that innovation pricing sticks and people will pay us more. So we've learned something through this process and we will continue to apply that throughout the years. And the other -- Yeah. Thermal management products, areas of certain power distribution E&I. Other PDUs where we have strength and it again, you're absolutely right, in the past, that hasn't been but as we've driven innovation and as we've gone through this process, the team has really reset at mind in understanding we can get paid for the things we do where we differentiate and that's when we'll continue to focus on that differentiation to drive that price and hold that price for the future. What we're seeing right now and from the pipelines and the discussions I'm having with most of our large customers, we continue to see a robust environment of orders. It -- I think this goes well beyond '22 into '23 into '24. I think there is just an enormous appetite for datacenter space on a global basis, Steve. We have not seen this kind of level. Normally, it's -- IMEA is growing faster, or it's Asia or it's Americas. This phenomenon that we're seeing now and experiencing is global expansion of data centers in all parts of the world. There's a lot more companies involved in the Tier 2, Tier 3 colos, a lot more building going -- being done for the hyperscalers. What I'd say is, it wasn't just an unusual time or one-off. I continue to see the market to be capacity constrained because of the volume of data centers that are needed to be built. And as we look at our pipeline, 18, 24 months ahead, it's more robust than we've ever seen. Thanks, Steve. Sure. This is Rob, I'll start out there as it relates to management. I mean, we are completely aligned with the share-owners and what we want to deliver. And that's really the earnings and profitability as we go forward. And as we look at goals and [Indiscernible] set for 2022, pricing is absolutely in there from a management, not just my team, but my team teams below and pricing is one of those, what we call okay-or-us, objectives for the year that we need to hit. As mentioned earlier, the incentive from the sales side. And again, depending on the part of the world, is primarily right now driven by their ability to discount or not discount. Sales -- they need to get sales with price to get more quota at the higher price. I guess in general, the higher price they get, the more quota attainment they retire. And it's true for, if I take a look at the selling regime that we have in America today, the salespeople are incented to get a higher price because they've got a higher multiplier and a higher commission when it comes to that. I'd say that we feel like the areas we need to really shore up was where that price leakage could happen on big deals and other areas and really push back on that and put higher levels of approval so that we're not giving price away further down in the organization. So I feel confident that both sales and management throughout the globe understands and gets the price and understand what it's going to mean to them, ultimately, in their wallet. These are specific projects as we go forward. If you take a look at the duration, the backlog, we used to say maybe it's 9 to 12 months or nine to 15, maybe it's a little bit longer than that or 6 to 9 months. Now it's 9 to 15, something like that, but it's not -- things don't get in the backlog if there are two years out, that type of thing. We are -- while people are looking to drive orders to us for that, what you'll see as the duration hasn't moved that much, maybe by, let's say, a quarter or three months type of thing based on what we've seen. Gary, you see anything different than that? Good afternoon.\n\ufeffQ - Andrew Obin: Just taking a longer picture. The medium-term goal for adjusted operating margin was 15% plus. How do you think about the bridge from the '22 midpoint of 9.3% up to 15%? You highlighted more aggressive pricing, but also how much do you think what's happening is structural in nature? One place in the environment going forward, more labor shortages, etc. Are you guys just putting out the fires or have you considered how to restore this long-term bridge? Thank you. Sure, again, I want to apologize to all you for our Q4 performance. As you know, we're not happy, you're not happy with it. We have a handle on the issues. I hope you saw that through our presentation today, and need to prove it to you throughout this year. We will earn your trust back. I want to thank you. And have a good day."

            "name": "DavidCote",
            "content": "I and the Vertiv's team are disappointed and embarrassed by our second half, '21 and projected first-half '22 financial performance. We got behind on the inflation recovery curve with insufficient price and stayed there all year. The past few months Rob and his team have implemented price increases that we expect will generate $360 million year-over-year price versus $260 million incremental inflation. Generating $100 million of favorable price costs for the full-year '22, because much of that price is in the backlog it takes. Several months for the increases show in the financials. And, the vast difference between our expected first half and second half '22 performances. Our unimpressive financial performance was exacerbated by continued supply chain issues, which don't show much sign of abating at this point. Like everyone else out there will hopefully be issued lessons in the second half, but we are counting on much less [Indiscernible]. On the past side our orders were through the roof and 4Q with total company orders up 51% in the Americas up a 114% in the first quarter is off to a good start, even with the price increases. Our short-term performance, including anticipated first half '22 results is unimpressive. Our expected long-term performance starting in the second half of 2022 will be quite impressive. We getting heads finally, on price inflation recovery. Our orders are off the charts and market-leading, supply chain should loose them. We have favorably resolved the tax receivable agreement in two lawsuits, and the product ramp up is just beginning. Some of you may be wondering why I don't get more involved. The answer is, I have. And that's why you see much more aggressive inflation forecasting, price implementation, and other fixes that Rob will talk about. The management is readily accepted and implemented the let's say, suggestions and will deliver as presented. I apologize for putting all our investors during this. That being said, if restructuring this year that should turn around in the second half, the long-term thesis is very intact, especially as performance begins in the second half, if you take the second half run rate into 2023, you can see how intact that thesis is. We know we have to prove it to you, and we will. So with that, I will turn the call over to Rob. Yeah. If you don't mind Scott, this is David Cote and I will probably ask Dave Fallon to interject also. 75% of our issue approximately is the Americas. And I think we're obviously being a little too kind. In the Americas there was a cultural issue between the sales guys and operations guys truly understanding what was going on. When the October results were actually okay. November looked a little bit worse, but not distressingly so. And we got the report that December was going to recover. And that's why we've been so aggressive on the pricing side. And if you take a look at our Americas ' orders, they were up 115% in the fourth quarter, which as Dave pointed out is an indication that we could've been pricing a lot better than we did and we have adjusted that, and that's why we're pleased to see that as we go into January, at least from what we can see February so far, orders in the Americas are continuing to grow even over what was a good first quarter of '21. But we've had to get much more heavily involved in resolving these issues. confident, they have been resolved and they will continue to work with the new process. And it's why I'm encouraged by what I see for the second half, which I think gives us a very good lead into the future and gets us back where we should have been all along. I think Dave's right. The -- one of our learnings from all this is how we've underestimated our ability to get price. Historically, not just currently, but historically. And that's another dynamic that's going to change. So yes, there has been a significant amount of change that's occurred over the last 60 days. And I think Rob -- Rob Dave, I don't know if there's anything else you want to add there? Thank you. Good luck, guys. Will pass it on. Just to add a little more color, Nicole, the Americas ' cultural issue was always there. It's just, it wasn't visible in a stable cost and supply chain environment. It became extraordinarily visible as we started to run into those two problems. And to a date balance point, Rob, pull together a come-to-Jesus meeting with the Americas operations and sales folks to say, this is not happening anymore, I'm not going to be the operator of your issues. You're going to sorted out just like we were able to in EMEA and APAC on your own and we want to figure out where exactly are we now and how do we have a better process going forward? In today's point I went on all day and then Rob and Dave came in at the conclusion and we adjusted what we thought was going to happen for '22 as a result of that, negatively, but it allowed us to be able to figure out where the bottom was a lot better than we had in the past. And they have changed the process that they're going to use going forward, both culturally and mechanically. And Rob and Dave are going to be very involved going forward. In understanding that reconciliation every month to make sure that we truly understand what the hell is going on. So yes, I'm confident that we've addressed that at this point, but this is -- this is going to take more than just a one-time meeting. It's going to require Rob and Dave's constant attention to make sure that it sticks, and they're doing that. If I could just interject something, a building on Rob's cultural point is I'd say historically we also underestimated the value of that differentiation that already existed. And we had our predisposition or deference to not lose the auto. And if you approach it that way, you will generally own the price. And this process has shown us that not only is our new innovation worth more than we thought, the innovation that already exist in our products and it's been historically under-priced, and this has been a really good warning for all of us in the business. So we've got a lot more capacity for price than we ever realized, The other thing -- I'm sorry. The other thing I would add is. as you might expect, what Rob is recommending to the Board is significantly lower than what a normal payout would be. And Rob is also recommending that he and his team take a zero bonus this year. I don't know how much more of an incentive you need than that to make things to work. But also, their comp is largely focused on equity. And a big part of this is driving -- making sure the stock price goes up. So they're heavily incented to make sure that all these things get fixed."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vertiv Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Anthony, and good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem. \n Before we begin, I'd point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement, our annual report on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. \n Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. On this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Good morning, everyone. The current environment we're operating in is certainly a challenging one. I can't remember a tying analogous to it. You can see from the press that demand remains strong in almost every end market and ours is very strong, especially with our new product initiatives. In the short term, we have to continue to fight the battles for component parts to support our customers, and we need to get ahead of the price inflation curve that Rob will tell you more about. While this is a painful and an irritating time to deal with, it is what it is. And I can assure you, we will come out of this admirably, especially given our investments in the long term. \n We're obviously enthused about the E+I acquisition, which we will do very well with. Gary and I were down in the E+I facility at South Carolina a few weeks ago with Phil brainstorming and reviewing the cost and revenue synergies we know we can create over the next several years. In addition to the synergy review, we discussed the investments we can make in further products and services, process improvements, people and systems that will pay dividends over the medium and long term. \n There is a lot happening in the business that portends a superb future. So while we continue planning and executing for the future, we recognize we also got to get through the current situation and do everything we can to continue supporting our customers, which we will do. \n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. Rob? \nRob Johnson: Thank you, Dave. The reviews that you continue to conduct with me and the team always leave us in a better place, and our business is actually in a much better place because of your involvement. So all of you on today's call, thank you for being here. I'm eager for you to hear more about our 2021 third quarter performance, our outlook on the market and an update on our portfolio. There are 6 key messages I want to convey today. \n First, as Dave mentioned, demand for Vertiv products and services remain strong. During our last earnings call, we reported second quarter sales were up more than 25% and orders were up 24% compared to the second quarter of last year. I'm pleased to report that sales and orders are up again in Q3. Sales were up 6%, which is very much in line with the guidance we provided in our last update and orders were up 17%. In addition, our Q3 backlog rose to $2.4 billion, the highest it's ever been. \n Second, profitability is up. This quarter, our adjusted operating profit was $131 million, up $64 million from last year's third quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of 490 basis points. \n Third, year-to-date free cash flow is greater today than it was this time last year. Free cash flow for Q3 was $44 million and year-to-date is $128 million. For a year -- from a year-to-date perspective, this represents an improvement of over $140 million versus the first 3 quarters of 2020. \n Fourth, as Dave mentioned, we are dealing, like others, with supply chain and inflationary issues. We encountered supply chain challenges in Q3 and experienced commodity and freight inflation. We made spot buys so that we can meet our delivery commitments we've made to our customers, and we have implemented strategies to recapture those costs. Pricing always lagged cost by a few quarters, and that's exactly what we're seeing now. However, we believe, as we've mentioned before, pricing will be a tailwind in 2022.  \n Fifth. We expect to close the E+I acquisition by November 1, which is a month earlier than previously communicated. In addition, we've signed an agreement to sell our heavy industrial UPS business, and we expect to close that transaction by the end of Q4. \n And the final key message is, we are confirming our latest guidance for the Vertiv base and slightly increasing our guidance for the impact of the M&A transaction. \n Turning to Slide 4. This is the chart we use to illustrate what we're seeing in each of our world regions in each of our end markets. In the cloud and hyperscale colocation markets, they continue to remain strong as evidenced by the green buttons. The demand for digital continues to fuel the industry and is driving a strong and growing need for Vertiv products and services. \n In our enterprise and small to medium business market, we continue to see signs of progress. Enough progress is made in Americas to upgrade this segment from yellow to green. We continue to experience an increase in the pipeline and orders with Americas leading the way. The communication networks had a few moments. We saw 5G deployments in earlier parts of the year being very robust and began to see that slow or a digestion over the last quarter or so. We've experienced Europe beginning to deploy 5G, and we see consistent deployment in Americas. In the commercial and industrial markets, things remain consistent. While this is a smaller size of our business, the variety of products and services we sell here continue to expand. \n Moving to Slide 5. As referenced in my opening slide, our order rates continue to be robust. Our Q3 order rates were up 17% over Q3 of 2020 and on a year-to-date basis are up 21% versus the same time period last time with cloud and colocation segment leading our way. Vertiv's executive team remains closely connected to the accounts, and we're seeing the strong demand continue. Because of the deliberate connections we are making, we are gaining further visibility into customer demand, leading to advanced orders and insight to their future pipelines that we haven't seen in the past, which is a tremendous help in our demand planning as we go forward. This and other actions we are taking have led to a record backlog, as I mentioned earlier, of $2.4 billion, which is 34% higher than our backlog was at the end of 2020. \n As you heard from Dave in his opening comments, supply chain continues to pose challenges for us and many, many others in the industry. Each of the regions are experiencing it, but it is most acute in Americas, where material availability is most difficult and commodity prices have risen beyond expectations. Where necessary, we'll continue to use spot buys so that we can take care of our customers. From a pricing standpoint, we are in line with our prior guidance we provided for Q4. We'll continue with pricing actions throughout 2022. \n Moving to Slide 6. When we spoke last, we expected to close the E+I deal by December 1, but I'm very pleased that we will be able to close this deal a month earlier due to the diligence of the combined Vertiv and E+I teams and with help from our transaction partners. We had successfully -- we had a successful debt raise a few weeks back, and all antitrust hurdles have been cleared. The market reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Gary, Phil, our Regional President, I have been on the phone with hundreds of customers and the receptivity to the deal is exactly what we wanted, very optimistic and very excited. Integration planning has started right after the deal was signed, and I look forward to entering into the execution mode in a few days. While E+I orders remain very strong, they are facing site readiness and supply issues on electric components, no different than others in the industry.  \n Now let's turn to divestitures of the heavy-duty industrial UPS business. We have signed an agreement to sell this business to a financial sponsor called InnovaFonds. InnovaFonds will retain the existing management team, which makes for a very easy transition and provides for great customer continuity. We expect this transaction, as mentioned early, to close by the end of Q4. \n With that, I'll turn it over to David to take a closer look at the Q3 numbers and we'll come back with some final comments at the end. David? \nDavid Fallon: Great. Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. Net sales were up $67 million or 6% and 4% when adjusted for a $20 million foreign exchange tailwind. However, our third quarter top line was negatively impacted by continued challenges with procuring electronic parts as underlying market demand is much stronger than implied in our year-over-year quarterly sales growth. The strong underlying market demand was evident with third quarter orders, as Rob mentioned, which were up 17% after increasing over 20% in the first half of the year. \n Adjusted operating profit of $131 million was just above the midpoint of our guidance range and increased $64 million or 94% from last year's third quarter, which included an $80 million charge for restructuring and an asset write-off. Contribution margin in the third quarter continued to be negatively impacted by material and freight inflation, which outpaced our pricing by approximately $40 million in the quarter. We expect to further narrow the imbalance between inflation and price in the fourth quarter and expect net price inflation to be favorable for full year 2022 as a result of incremental pricing actions in the fourth quarter and into next year. \n Adjusted operating margin of 10.7% was 490 basis points higher than last year's third quarter, but approximately 200 basis points lower when last year is adjusted for the restructuring and asset write-off charge. And this year-over-year reduction is driven entirely by net inflation. Finally, on this page, free cash flow of $44 million was approximately $85 million lower than last year, and we will address the components of that delta in just a couple of slides. But despite this quarterly unfavorable variance year-to-date free cash flow of $128 million is still approximately $140 million higher than the same period last year. \n Next, turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to be more impacted by supply chain challenges than the 2 other regions due to regional differences in the paid for material inflation and availability of electronic parts. These supply chain challenges negatively impacted both America's top and bottom line with net sales up just $5 million or 1% against the strong market backdrop and adjusted operating margin was down approximately 400 basis points driven primarily by net inflation. \n Moving to the right, APAC net sales were up approximately 4%, but relatively flat on an organic basis, as last year's third quarter benefited from China government investment in several telecom and wind power programs. Third quarter adjusted operating margin in APAC was up both before and after adjusting for the $11 million restructuring charge in last year's third quarter. \n EMEA continues to post very strong financial performance with net sales up 19% from last year's third quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up almost 300 basis points after adjusting for last year's $41 million regional restructuring charge. And although not immune to the effects of net inflation, the EMEA supply chain environment, at least to date, has been less disrupted than the other 2 regions. \n Next, turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges the third quarter free cash flow from last year, down about $85 million to $44 million. The most significant negative variance is driven by a $43 million inventory build in this year's third quarter, in part due to several large project delays and the strategic stocking of certain electronic parts to protect future customer deliveries. CapEx was approximately $10 million higher this year versus last year. And certainly last year's third quarter was negatively impacted by certain COVID constraints. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is up $128 million. And we reaffirm our full year free cash flow guidance of $205 million, which includes approximately $45 million cash outflow for M&A transaction expenses. \n Next, turning to Slide 10. This page summarizes our fourth quarter financial guidance, which includes provision for base Vertiv prior to M&A activity plus the expected impact of the E+I acquisition and the industrial UPS business divestiture. So we're avoiding the doubt, we M&A transaction closing and other expenses in our financial results and guidance, $18 million in the third quarter, which includes a $9 million impairment loss for the sale of the industrial UPS business, and $51 million in the fourth quarter or $69 million total transaction expenses for the full year. And we summarize our non-GAAP treatment of these expenses in the reconciliations in the appendix to this presentation. \n Our base Vertiv net sales guidance is up approximately $35 million from our previous guidance based upon improved visibility of our supply and shipment schedules in the fourth quarter. We have also added $55 million incremental net sales from M&A, including $65 million from E+I, offset by $10 million reduced sales from the industrial UPS business divestiture. As Rob mentioned, when we announced the E+I transaction at the beginning of September, we anticipated a December 1 closing date and $45 million of incremental fourth quarter revenue from E+I. Now with the acceleration of the anticipated closing date to November 1, we expect $65 million of incremental E+I revenue in the fourth quarter. \n Adjusted operating profit for base Vertiv is materially in line with our previous guidance at $540 million, with the benefit from higher net sales, offset by higher expected gross material and freight inflation versus our early September guidance. We have added approximately $13 million in operating profit to our guidance for M&A, and that includes $15 million for E+I, assuming a November 1 closing date once again. And that $15 million is offset by approximately $2 million from the sale of the industrial UPS business, expected to close in early December. Compared with last year's fourth quarter, net sales are expected to be up 8%, adjusted operating profit up 16%, with 90 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted EPS is expected to be down approximately $0.02 per share but the year-over-year comparison certainly is negatively impacted by the timing of income tax expense in this year's fourth quarter, which is artificially high due to the quarterly treatment of some nondeductible losses from the changes in the fair value of the warrant liability.\n Next, turning to Slide 11. We summarized our full year 2021 financial guidance, which includes base Vertiv and provision for the M&A activity. Full year net sales are expected to be $5 billion for the full year, and that's up 14% from 2020, including M&A. And the adjusted operating profit for 2021 is expected to be $553 million, up 62% from 2020 and still up 22% when adjusted for the $113 million of 2020 pro forma items. Our full year adjusted operating profit guidance for base Vertiv is unchanged from our previous guidance, so that's at $540 million. And adjusted operating margin for the full year is expected to be 11.1%, up 330 basis points from 2020 and still up 70 basis points when adjusted for 2020 pro forma items. Our full year free cash flow guidance of $205 million remains unchanged from previous guidance. And once again, this includes approximately $45 million of expected M&A cash transaction and closing expenses. \n So with that said, I turn it back over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Well, thanks, David. Let's turn to Slide 12. Well, almost all the commentary thus far has been focused on 2021. We did want to provide an early glimpse of 2022, which we're really excited about. From a top line perspective, we clearly enter the year with a backlog that's significantly higher than what we came into in 2021. And from my view, right now, the backlog will be approximately $500 million higher than previous. \n As discussed on the earlier slide, our markets continue to show strong demand for our products. All signs are pruning to cloud and colocation markets remaining robust globally. And from an enterprise perspective, demand should continue at the same pace we're seeing it today. During our last few calls, we highlighted some of the Vertiv product development initiatives we have underway. And these products only accelerate in 2022 and beyond. We continue to invest in new product development and go-to-market strategies. From a potential headwind standpoint, we're expecting to see parts shortages last at least through the first half of next year. We also know customers are dealing with trade labor shortages and difficulty in getting some of the key building materials that they need. While it's difficult to predict the exact impact on us. These are very real issues and our customers are dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. \n As for profitability in 2022, we expect pricing will be a tailwind. We will have a full year of E+I in our results, which will be accretive. We will continue to deploy the tenants of VOS, fixed cost constant and as mentioned earlier, still funding incremental R&D and growth initiatives. We do expect inflation to continue into 2022. But even at today's level, we are planning next year to be net positive on price. \n Turning to Slide 13. As I close, I want you to know how proud I am with the Vertiv team and what we together as 1 Vertiv, have accomplished in the first 9 months. The results we've shared today are reflective of the hard work and commitment of our 20,000 employees globally, some of the factories, some in the field, some in the offices and some still working remotely in over 130 countries. \n As I look at the remaining month of 2021, as we continue to invest strategically, I'm confident we will see above-market top line growth, increase in profitability and strengthening in our balance sheet. When I look down the road at 2022 and beyond, my confidence is bolstered by the conversations I've had personally with partners and customers around the globe about demand, pricing and future pipelines. \n To all employees, I'm grateful for you and the part you played in the past 3 months that have allowed me to provide today's earnings report. Thank you for your dedication and your tireless efforts to take care of the customer. To our investors, thank you all for being on the call today. Thank you for your trust and support. It's truly my pleasure to be leading Vertiv. \n I'll now turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: First on price, if we could, and just a little more color on what you're thinking about for next year. So your prices looks like it's kind of doubles in Q4 versus what you had in Q3. But I'm just wondering if you can give us some sense of how much price is in backlog at this point? And when you talk about price cost positive in 2022. Are you talking on -- I'm sure you at least me on a dollar basis, but I wonder if you also see it being positive on a margin rate basis? \nRob Johnson: Jeff, this is Rob. I'll start first, and then David and Gary can chime in. First of all, I'd like to start off by saying that we, and it's on me, have under-forecasted what inflation was going to do. And therefore, we haven't received the pricing level necessary to offset inflation in previous quarters. I can assure you going forward with our robust pricing actions and what we are doing now and we'll be doing in 2022 that we will be positive in price based on what we're executing on. So again, I just wanted to let everyone know on the call today that under forecasted inflation, we understand where that's at. We're even assuming that it could get potentially worse and we're making sure that our pricing actions now and going forward cover that. David? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Rob. So I think if you look at the numbers and where we stand or where we expect to stand at the end of the fourth quarter is that in a do-nothing scenario, which is not going to happen, in a do-nothing scenario the wraparound effect of net price inflation is probably a small tailwind in the $5 million to $10 million range. So we're certainly encouraged with what we're seeing in the pricing environment here in the fourth quarter. As you mentioned, it's about a $15 million step up from Q3, but we're certainly not satisfied. \n As Rob mentioned, we've left some dollars on the table this year because we've underestimated inflation. And we certainly are going to be much more aggressive, and we have current plans in action to continue those price increases fairly significantly into 2022. But from a wraparound impact looking at the numbers, a floor is probably a $5 million to $10 million tailwind. And of course, we are in our pricing plans, anticipating that inflation will continue to accelerate, whether it does or not, I don't think anybody knows. \n But we're anticipating that it will accelerate. And of course, we anticipate a much more significant dollar tailwind. And I appreciate your comment on the -- as it relates to recapturing the margin percentage. I would say that is our intent, and we do appreciate the math of trying to do that. You could recapture the dollars, but not recapture the percentages. But just to let you know, we are looking at that dynamic as well, and that certainly is our long-term goal. \nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Very clear. And then I wonder if we could just talk about a little bit more color on what you're seeing on enterprise. Good to see the green dot, little color on the magnitude of the activity there and maybe anything you could share on the type of customer or what type of work is starting to manifest itself there? \nRob Johnson: Sure, Jeff. This is Rob. I'll start off and then Gary might add some additional color. What we're seeing right now, and especially in Americas, as we mentioned, is kind of a rebound of small to medium business and enterprise as they go back to work, refreshing their networks, their network closets. So we've seen that activity in the channel space for us beginning to pick up. And that's why we moved it from yellow to green. We're also seeing in the enterprise areas, people reconfiguring their data centers, taking the time projects they probably put on hold during the pandemic and now they're getting back to some new builds, some reconfiguration on build as they build out their hybrid cloud strategies going forward and rightsize, I guess, I would say, the current data centers that will be on-prem. \n So that's what really gives us confidence led by Americas, haven't seen parts of Asia, we didn't talk much about because Asia, as you know, is still being played on and off with COVID. We expect, hopefully, going into Q1 next year, Q2, that those activities that COVID would clear itself up and we could see enterprise going in the right direction there. And in Europe, we're continuing to execute on our channel strategy there to drive more and more enterprise business. But in general, corporations are spending money. They are taking care of their infrastructure now that people are getting back into the office. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: The tone of your comments, Rob, are meaningfully more positive than just a month ago, I imagine that's somewhat purposeful. But that's not my question. The -- you kind of alluded to the reality that these projects are being announced may get pushed to the right because of lack of kind of labor and materials. How does that -- logistically, what does that mean for you guys? Does it mean that orders get delayed, it's that simple? Or does the customer because of lack of supply, kind of take -- want to take delivery anyways and just warehouse things so that they don't have further delays once they get kind of brick-and-mortar down? How does that kind of logistically work? Are we just -- or do we not know yet, Rob? \nRob Johnson: No, Scott, absolutely. And I think you kind of nailed it. While we don't know exactly which sites are going to be impacted. What we are seeing is customers willing to take that inventory in some cases and warehouses, so they have it when that site does turn on so they don't lose their production slot or they don't lose their equipment to somebody else. That being said, that's more of a new phenomenon. And as I reach out to more of our large customers, more and more of them are wanting some type of program to have inventory go ahead and take it off our hands and take the responsibility of it. \n But it's a really dynamic situation. And even things as roofing systems, which you think would be simple have gone out to 44 weeks in lead times. So they are being stressed not by necessarily the equipment manufacturers. If I look at the lead times, yes, they've gone out, but not near as far as some of these other base building materials that they need for their sites. That being said, our business is a combination of new builds and brownfields, and we feel good about that. But some of the larger projects will experience site difficulties from time to time due to trade labor and so on. \nScott Davis: Okay. That's super helpful. And then in the same context, when you've missed a sale over the last quarter because of supply chain. Has there been instances where that sale has kind of gone away or somebody else has been able to supply it? Or is the entire market just so tight that the stuff just gets moved into backlog and everybody is comfortable with the fact that deliveries will just be a little late? \nRob Johnson: Yes. There's been spot places where we've seen somebody had to have something and somebody was willing to jump the line and maybe a competitor willing to jump the line and knock another customer out. We've been very honorable with what we've told our customers and we've not played that game. So I'd say while that's happening, it's very little. I mean the market is tight for everybody. And we've seen, without going into detail, smaller competitors and even larger competitors -- we commit. \n As you know, we were one of the first companies to come out and talk about this issue, and we did it around the announcement of the acquisition because we felt that was fair and honest to let you guys know exactly what we're seeing. But I don't think we're penalized any worse than anybody else, and the backlog will continue to grow. And quite honestly, people will continue to drive further visibility. And I mentioned that earlier in my discussions, I like the visibility we're getting. \n The industry has traditionally not shared that because they feel it's a competitive issue because we work with a lot of competitors -- to our customers and they want to make sure. But what we're finding is building those relationships and that collaborative relationship, we're able to get even a longer view into the builds and locations, which is going to help us in the future of our planning and expansion of capacity. \nScott Davis: Helpful. Best of luck the rest of the year. I'll pass it on. \nOperator: Next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I just have a few as well. [ You posted ] for this $40 million of net price headwind that we have in the September quarter. I think you talked about becoming $25 million in December. Just -- we feel confident that, that should be -- this should be the peak number. And as you go through '22, that number should start to become positive. Is that the right way to think about it? And kind of where do you see it's actually positive in '22? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David. Absolutely confirmed that we anticipate 3Q to be the peak net price inflation in balance. And Q3's $40 million, I think it was $25 million in Q2. We anticipate inflation to stay at the same level in Q4, but pricing to ramp up about $15 million. So that imbalance should drop to $25 million for Q4. And if you look at just pure wraparound effect, it would be a $10 million imbalance in Q1 of 2022. But of course, that does not contemplate any additional pricing actions, and we would anticipate to get to a point where those 2 elements offset one another, sometimes in the first quarter. \nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. And then if I can just kind of shift gears a little bit. And when I think about this market environment chart -- slide that you folks have, it seems to us at least that some of the key verticals are starting to inflect higher. I think Facebook on the hyperscale side, talked about CapEx being up 65% next year in '22. And then enterprise IT spend, I think, is equally starting to pick up at the bigger enterprise companies. I guess all the data would suggest that growth, if you're levered to data center, should accelerate and be better in '22 versus '21. I wonder if you'd agree with that broadly and if not, what are the offsets that we should consider with that statement? \nRob Johnson: Yes, I would absolutely agree with what you just said. And then it kind of falls in line with what we're saying about enterprise. And enterprise should be stronger next year as we began to see the things pick up and continue to grow our channel business. As it relates to -- and we get asked this all the time and that -- what's happening is this -- there's always been a build and fill situation where we have this absorption going on and what's different, why is it different now? \n You're absolutely right, colo and hyperscalers, more money is being poured into that. The utilization rates are high. What's going to be the limiting factor for the growth, not necessarily orders growth, but growth on the sales side and delivery is going to be that material and labor shortages on probably their end. \n But at the end of the day, the appetite as far as I can see out and we typically have 18 to 24 months look ahead on the pipeline and things like that, looks very robust. And that's why I'm very bullish right now that get these supply issues behind us, which are a big nuisance for all of us. And get moving forward, the market needs more critical data centers. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: I promise you no more price cost questions. So I think that's been vetted quite well. So the backlog of $40 million of growth exit the year, I mean just the simple math gets you double-digit growth of your 2021 revenue base, which I know is not the right way to think about it, but I'll ask the question anyway. Does that imply double-digit growth in 2022, just from the backlog? And then within that, are we seeing any change in China? Because the tech companies are getting defenestrated in China. So just curious if that's having any impact on their CapEx plans or capacity plans in any way? \nRob Johnson: Nigel, this is Rob. I'll start up here. Well, we're seeing a robust backlog. Again, a lot of 2022 is going to be dependent on supply and site  readiness and capability. So not ready to commit on a 2022 number. But looking at our backlog and the orders growth, it certainly would imply a robust 2022, assuming we can deliver. China is -- moving to China, a lot of stuff in the news about what's going on with China, how they're cracking down on some of the hyperscale activities. Certainly, the power outages because of the coal issues which has not been affecting us currently right now because we're deemed essential, and we continue to run as we provide. \n It is a dynamic environment over there. And as you know, when China decides to do something and put a stimulus in like they did in the beginning of the year for 5G growth and some other things, we do see kind of a higher-than-average growth. But in general, we feel good about our position, our focus on product development, being local there and continue to grow our share there. \nNigel Coe: Great. And then my follow-on is on the EMEA margins. 19% pretty extraordinary in the current environment. And you also had, I think, a 20% handle last quarter. So just curious, number one, what's driving that margin strength? And secondly, are we sort of moving to a new plateau in Europe? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David. So number one, thank you for recognizing that. I would say there's 2 things that are driving the enhancements and margins we think this year. One is definitely centered on the fixed cost constant philosophy. So we continue to not only keep fixed cost constant in EMEA, but we've actually been able to take costs down as it relates to the investment in some of the restructuring. So we certainly see a benefit there from the leverage. \n So with sales up as significant as they are there. And our anticipation for the full year is that they should be in that upper teens sales growth. We certainly are benefiting from that fixed cost leverage. That's probably the primary driver. I mentioned on the call that the supply chain environment in EMEA probably has been a little less disruptive than the other 2 regions, but they still are negative from a contribution margin perspective as it relates to net price cost. I would say most of the lift we've seen this year is because of the fixed cost dynamic. \nOperator: The next question comes from Lance Vitanza with Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: I had a couple of questions. The first actually is back on the supply chain. But I'm just trying to understand the accelerating order growth that you saw, which was quite noticeable to 17% year-on-year. How much of that is, would we say organic? Or is that just reflecting the price increases that you're putting in place? I'm just trying to get a sense for, is volume picking up as well, at least from a demand perspective? I know, obviously, there are issues with respect to your ability to fulfill. \n And then the next question is, should we expect the above-average inventory build that we saw in the third quarter? How long does that persist? Is that sort of through the first half of '22 as well? And is the kind of $40 million to $45 million of incremental build per quarter. Is that a good run rate to model? Or is that -- or is there something else we should be thinking about there? \nRob Johnson: Lance, thanks for the question. This is Rob. I'll take the first half, and I'll give David the second half on that. As it relates to the growth, and I think we talked last time when we announced the E+I acquisition, we're posting up around 12% orders growth. We did see an acceleration. I would say it's hard to kind of break out, I'd say, right now, the price and that certainly, there's some price in there, but we're seeing a strong strength in demand. Part of that is people are placing POs as we are as a company, a little further ahead in the future so that they make sure they get in line. But in general, the market is pretty robust. As you see -- begin to see the comment that someone made earlier around the CapEx that the hyperscalers and colo companies are spending. So certainly, there's some price in there for sure, but there's also just a strong underlying growth in the market. David, second half? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Rob, and thanks for the question, Lance. So as it relates to inventory, you're absolutely right. So if you look at year-to-date inventory, it's probably up $130 million from the end of last year and with approximately $40 million build in the quarter. It's not unusual for us to build inventory during the year and then have that come down in the fourth quarter based on what is usually a very strong sales quarter. I think we're going to see a little bit of that dynamic this year, but probably a little muted. I would anticipate year-end inventory declining somewhat, but very much dependent upon the dynamic out there as it relates to the parts shortage. \n We certainly are not artificially constraining ourselves to hit any internal inventory days or turnover targets. If we can find the parts, we're making the right business decision, and we'll buy the parts, and we'll park in an inventory to protect delivery for 2022. With that said, we're very mindful of the impact that inventory has on free cash flow, a very important metric for us, and we are implementing actions to optimize that inventory level. So I would anticipate a dip in Q1, but we could see an additional build -- I'm sorry, a dip in Q4, and we could see an additional build as we go through the first half of next year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: So I just have ... \nRob Johnson: Nicole, it seems like your name is coming through some variation also. \nNicole DeBlase: Always. I don't even try anymore. Well, I guess maybe starting with -- I do have a follow-up on price cost, if you don't mind. When you were answering Jeff's question about the floor on pricing, the $5 million to $10 million -- or price cost, the $5 million to $10 million for 2022. Does that include the pricing actions that you've taken to date? I assume it does, but I just wanted to check on that. \n And then I guess like with the view that 3Q is the worst and that's behind you, is that based on your view that inflation kind of gets worse in the fourth quarter? Or is that assuming normal spot rates inflation is kind of peaking. Just wanted to understand the philosophy behind that. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David. So I'll grasp your second question first. So our assumption is that inflation in Q4 is consistent with inflation in Q3. And if you want to put a specific number to it, I think everybody at some point, will be able to triangulate all these numbers on a quarterly basis. But we're assuming $55 million of year-over-year gross inflation in Q4. That was the same number that we saw in Q3. So we don't anticipate that inflation gets any better or worse in Q4 versus Q3, and that's consistent with what we've seen so far in the month of October. \n As it relates to the wraparound effect for 2022, it's a little bit of a math exercise. So that's just looking at -- if you look at that $55 million inflation number we see in Q4, if you wrap that around for the full year, based on what we've seen in 2022, you'll end up with an additional $60 million headwind for inflation. If you do the same thing for pricing, and so to your point, that would only include actions that we see in the P&L in Q4 2021. So that's about $30 million. if you wrap that around, you get a $65 million tailwind for pricing. And that's the $5 million to $10 million that we referenced. It's kind of a pure math exercise. Just to give comfort that, that's really the floor that we would see on a base case. But of course, that does not contemplate pricing actions that we've taken in Q4 that have not been recognized in the P&L yet. It also assumes that inflation does not get worse. But we thought that would just be kind of a helpful gauge for what would a floor number would be. \nNicole DeBlase: That is super helpful. Thank you for walking me through that. So you talked about the revised outlook for EMEA for the full year, I guess any change to the way you're thinking about North America or Asia Pacific? \nDavid Fallon: This is David, I will start, and Rob and Gary can speak. So I would say, if you look at the dynamics of both pricing and inflation for 2021, Americas has certainly been impacted more than the other 2 regions. And once again ... \nNicole DeBlase: I'm sorry, David, I meant revenue growth, not price cost, sorry. \nRob Johnson: Nicole. I'll take that. From a revenue growth perspective, EMEA has had some, I would say, very good tailwinds basically produced by our -- what we call our global accounts team that we've pulled together. So we've seen an aggressive build-out across Europe partially due to sovereignty, partially due to some of the Brexit activities early on and just everyone wanting data centers. So you're seeing a tremendous amount of bills happening in Europe as we speak today. That being said, the outlook as we look and look at our pipeline, as I mentioned, we've got pretty good views. I expect robust growth to be happening really around the globe. \n I expect Americas, a lot of people think Americas is done and built out, that is not the case. There's more data centers needed than we currently have today. And I think you'll see an acceleration of growth in 2022 for that, both colo and hyperscale and as enterprise recovers. And then if you look at Asia, Southeast Asia, specifically, they've been -- COVID has really slowed them down from the ability to build, deliver projects. So I think when that gets unlocked, you'll see a nice set of growth there. And then we commented on China earlier. I can't -- I wish I had a better crystal ball to tell exactly what was going to happen over there, but we continue to see that as a good market for us. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: So the first on the E+I acquisition, you spoke to positive customer feedback that you're receiving. Can you elaborate a bit more on what you're hearing from customers? And I think some of the value proposition is being able to sell a broader set of products, maybe you can talk specifically to what you're hearing from customers on your ability to provide a broader set of solutions? \nRob Johnson: Sure, Mark. This is Rob. Thanks for the question. Yes, in general, the excitement is it actually fills out the portfolio. While we've talked about it in the past that switchgear wasn't necessarily something we had to have. as the systems get more tightly integrated as we put the controls and drive efficiency, modularity, which we've been talking about for a while, these modular integrated data center is becoming more and more part of it. So they're excited the fact that a company of Vertiv size with our service organization, which E+I didn't have a lot of service organization, we can really kind of complete that entire deal for them. \n The bus bar category was something that we didn't really participate much in, and E+I is a global leader in providing bus bar. And the excitement, I would say, when we talk to a lot of the global colos and hyperscale is the fact that we'll help accelerate and bring these products to all places in the world. E+I haven't really been very present at all. They don't have a factory in India in China or rest of Asia. So the fact that they can now get global consistency, global products and the modularity side of it is a big one. \n E+I has done just an incredible job in Europe, providing modular power skids. They've got a new facility opened in South Carolina, which have been receiving orders for modular. So it gives us that capability that in some areas we do ourselves like, for example, in Europe, Croatia. But in areas in the U.S., we would sub that out maybe to a third party and have them assemble our equipment and pull that together. Now we'll have that in-house capability and that core thing. So in general, it wasn't anything to do with the exception of -E+I is a great company. Now it's even better with the backing of Vertiv services and Vertiv sales and Vertiv's global reach. \nMark Delaney: That's helpful. And the second question was on supply chain and maybe a two-part   question there. First in terms of supply chain compared to when you gave the business update in September, is it incrementally better, incrementally worse? Any change over the last month or so? And then second part is, you're expecting supply chain to be tight through at least the first half of 2022, can you elaborate on what you're hearing from your suppliers? What's most difficult to procure and what's behind that comment around supply chain being tight through first half next year? \nRob Johnson: Sure. And this is an ever-changing environment. So we have been speaking in the past about fan situations. Our engineering teams work diligently to qualify additional fan manufacturers to bring into our build and bring into our products. So some of the things have eased up and actually beginning to get better as we bring some new suppliers on. I would say that still neutral on where we talked about chips, working with our chip manufacturers and that capacity coming online end of the year coming into Q1, Q2. Again, mixed bag on what people are saying in the market. But as we talk to our suppliers there, they feel like that they'll have the capacity beginning to come on middle to the end of Q2 from that. \n As we think about breakers, which we all use, breakers, and there's a few circuit breaker manufacturers on a global basis, that seems to have gotten worse from a supply perspective versus when we talked before, I think -- I'm not sure that it's bottomed out, but I think it probably is getting close to that from a lead time going out. \n And then some of the things that maybe are getting better, but still spotty is the IGBTs, which we've talked about in the past and some of that was just due to the fact that COVID was affecting some of the factories in Vietnam and other parts of the world, and we'll see them coming back online. So in general, maybe a few parts and a little more detail here probably one of a few parts getting a little bit worse from a lead time perspective and some things improving. And, again, our thoughts are, while we don't have a perfect crystal ball if all the things were -- being told from the supply base, things should begin to get better for the second half, which we talked about for next year. \nOperator: Your next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: Thanks for answering a lot of questions, but how have your win rates on new projects trended year-to-date, particularly given capacity constraints? And any quantification you can give around the benefit from new products and production? \nRob Johnson: I'll start with second one first, and then Gary can comment a little bit about some of the win rates. But I'll tell you that we're very excited about some of the new products that we've talked about in the past that have launched, that have been received quite well. One area that I've been excited about is our thermal managing area where we continue to be a world leader and the global supplier of that. The dynamics of changing of what people want to use in the data center. \n While a lot of people are staying away from water, we have a really good system that is waterless, very efficient that helps them drive towards their carbon-neutral platform. That would be one example that we talked about in the past, and we've seen a better then expected uptick of that. So people are liking the innovation, we're liking what we're bringing out. \n I would say in the channel side of things as well, the solutions that we've been bringing to the channel, whether it's first in some of the lithium-ion battery products, our Geist, kind of our award-winning power distribution product line, has had several launches that have picked up. So in general, I guess, I am more than thrilled with what we've delivered so far, and really excited as Dave mentioned, Cote. We continue to pull gas on the fire for innovation, and we'll continue to deliver those products, both in channel and in the colo, hyperscale and enterprise base. Gary? \nGary Niederpruem: Andrew, it's Gary. So I think in terms of your first question, the 2 things we do watch clearly are how is the pipeline trending and then what is our win rate by product line and by region. And for the most part, pretty good visibility into both of those. Pipeline continues to accelerate, particularly if I look at where we sit today versus even a year ago at this time. And then the win rates are also worst case, flat, maybe even a little bit better in some areas and largely due to the new product introductions that Rob talked about. So those are very much tied hand in hand. So for where we sit today, I think the order rate is certainly commensurate with pipeline activity increasing as well as win rates probably even inching up versus what we would have seen a year ago. \nAndrew Obin: Great. And just maybe to build on this answer, as you talk about, I think people brought it up, the industry perhaps even inflecting into '22. What are we -- we're hearing a lot of stuff, right? You hear hyperscalers sort of starting to come up with proprietary technology. I think a couple of years ago, 3M was highlighting, it's -- on proprietary liquid for cooling, I'm not sure what happened there. There's talk about things sort of shifting from edge to the cloud and from cloud to the edge. Just big picture, what are the big themes and new exciting stuff on the horizon? And how are you guys positioned if sort of can take a longer-term view? \nRob Johnson: Great question. And a lot of people read into hyperscalers and what they're doing. And certainly, one of the areas that the hyperscalers have spent time and innovation on is around the servers themselves, the servers, the storage and doing a lot of that development themselves, doing their own chips. Several have announced that. As it relates to infrastructure, we do a lot of collaboration with them. there's certainly hyperscalers, some want things down exactly the way they want them. And so we're a collaborator or provider using our IP and in some cases, a mixture of joint IP, but for the most part, our IP. \n So we don't see them going in a big way into our space as it relates to large power, large thermal, but we do see them influencing our Vertiv product development as we go forward from that perspective. As it relates to technologies which you're referring to with 3M is really their 2-phase immersion cooling fluid that they've talked about, and we see that really originating in bitcoin operations where there's really high-density, super high density servers and immersion cooling is just yet another way to take the heat out in a high-density situation. If you think about the landscape, it will continue to evolve. \n And while we're involved with immersion cooling, and I think I've talked about this before with the single Phase III -- II Phase, we're involved in both of those as part of our R&D, and we're deploying and we have partners there. I think if you think about where the industry will continue to change and evolve is one of our sweet spots, and that's the thermal, continue to whether it's immersion, whether it's cold plates and some cooling at the chip level, all those things Vertiv's engaged with and very forward thinking on things that are going to be 2 to 3 years out. So we feel good about that. \n The other area that I think you'll see a focus on is generators, right? Generators is an area that creates a lot of concern and they're not looked upon as favorable for siding and so forth. So maybe alternate ways of doing tighter integration with renewables and even things such as fuel cells, which I wouldn't have thought in my lifetime would become -- began to become more mainstay. But with fuel cells and solar and wind and battery storage, those are some of the things, I think if you look at the future, they have been talked about by a lot of the hyperscalers and colos and certainly, Vertiv with its increased R&D budgets are participating in collaboration and making sure we have a place in that game. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Just looking -- maybe this is just parsing the numbers a little bit too much. But when you look at the numbers we were assuming for December contribution from the E+I deal and we multiply those by 12, we got pretty close to your guidance for that for '22. When we look at the numbers you're giving now on kind of November and December, taking those 2 months and then annualizing them? I get to kind of numbers that are significantly below what you had guided to. Any seasonality around these numbers that 1 month isn't equal kind of to the other as we get towards the end of the year, just seems like the contribution you're now forecasting is just a little bit light of what we were expecting around year-end or maybe they're having supply chain issues as well? \nGary Niederpruem: Steve, it's Gary. So I think there's probably a little bit of all of that, what you just said. First and foremost is probably what Rob's comments earlier alluded to in terms of site readiness. So whether that is literally getting concrete forward for some of these new sites and/or having trade labor on the other hand to be able to receive it in invoices in time. So there are some things that we're probably going to ship at the end of December that most likely are going to push to January. So there's certainly a site readiness issue would be one of them. There's a little bit of supply chain and there are no different than what we're speaking about to Rob mentioned electronic parts a few times, so they're not immune to that. So there's a little bit of that. And then maybe third is there's a little bit of seasonality, but I think most of it is really just chalked up to primarily site readiness with a little bit of the supply chain constraints. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. So we look out like the $570 million, $140 million for next year, is that still intact? Is that a little more back-end loaded? Like what's the update there? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David. I would say nothing that we've seen with E+I up to this point has changed our view for 2022 and our expectations for financials. We'll certainly give an update and include that in our guidance when we announce 4Q. But I would say, nothing we have seen has changed our expectations for next year. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just one last one. Pretty strong backlog, obviously, on a relative basis. I would have expected, though, with orders up 17%, it would have been -- our calc is kind of getting us to north of $2.5 billion. Obviously, there's some puts and takes on how you calculate backlog. But is there -- is there anything there, did that stuff -- some stuff move out as other stuff moved in? Or is the calc just not as easy as backlog minus sales plus orders? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David, Steve. We can work with you on that. There's sometimes an element of rounding in there as well. So our backlog was up close to $200 million in the quarter. The book-to-bill was clearly in that 115%, 120% range. But we have made no significant adjustments as it relates to the backlog, meaning booked orders coming out. There is sometimes an FX component to it that creates some noise. But I would say there's nothing significantly that has changed with how we calculate backlog. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks. \nRob Johnson: Well again, thank you for all being here today, and thank you for your continued support. As you can tell, we're pretty excited about what we're going into for 2022. We'll get through these supply issues, and we'll continue to invest in our R&D and continue to bring new products to market that has the innovation that our customers are looking for. So thanks again. Have a great day. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. Net sales were up $67 million or 6% and 4% when adjusted for a $20 million foreign exchange tailwind. However, our third quarter top line was negatively impacted by continued challenges with procuring electronic parts as underlying market demand is much stronger than implied in our year-over-year quarterly sales growth. The strong underlying market demand was evident with third quarter orders, as Rob mentioned, which were up 17% after increasing over 20% in the first half of the year. \n Adjusted operating profit of $131 million was just above the midpoint of our guidance range and increased $64 million or 94% from last year's third quarter, which included an $80 million charge for restructuring and an asset write-off. Contribution margin in the third quarter continued to be negatively impacted by material and freight inflation, which outpaced our pricing by approximately $40 million in the quarter. We expect to further narrow the imbalance between inflation and price in the fourth quarter and expect net price inflation to be favorable for full year 2022 as a result of incremental pricing actions in the fourth quarter and into next year. \n Adjusted operating margin of 10.7% was 490 basis points higher than last year's third quarter, but approximately 200 basis points lower when last year is adjusted for the restructuring and asset write-off charge. And this year-over-year reduction is driven entirely by net inflation. Finally, on this page, free cash flow of $44 million was approximately $85 million lower than last year, and we will address the components of that delta in just a couple of slides. But despite this quarterly unfavorable variance year-to-date free cash flow of $128 million is still approximately $140 million higher than the same period last year. \n Next, turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to be more impacted by supply chain challenges than the 2 other regions due to regional differences in the paid for material inflation and availability of electronic parts. These supply chain challenges negatively impacted both America's top and bottom line with net sales up just $5 million or 1% against the strong market backdrop and adjusted operating margin was down approximately 400 basis points driven primarily by net inflation. \n Moving to the right, APAC net sales were up approximately 4%, but relatively flat on an organic basis, as last year's third quarter benefited from China government investment in several telecom and wind power programs. Third quarter adjusted operating margin in APAC was up both before and after adjusting for the $11 million restructuring charge in last year's third quarter. \n EMEA continues to post very strong financial performance with net sales up 19% from last year's third quarter, and adjusted operating margin was up almost 300 basis points after adjusting for last year's $41 million regional restructuring charge. And although not immune to the effects of net inflation, the EMEA supply chain environment, at least to date, has been less disrupted than the other 2 regions. \n Next, turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges the third quarter free cash flow from last year, down about $85 million to $44 million. The most significant negative variance is driven by a $43 million inventory build in this year's third quarter, in part due to several large project delays and the strategic stocking of certain electronic parts to protect future customer deliveries. CapEx was approximately $10 million higher this year versus last year. And certainly last year's third quarter was negatively impacted by certain COVID constraints. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is up $128 million. And we reaffirm our full year free cash flow guidance of $205 million, which includes approximately $45 million cash outflow for M&A transaction expenses. \n Next, turning to Slide 10. This page summarizes our fourth quarter financial guidance, which includes provision for base Vertiv prior to M&A activity plus the expected impact of the E+I acquisition and the industrial UPS business divestiture. So we're avoiding the doubt, we M&A transaction closing and other expenses in our financial results and guidance, $18 million in the third quarter, which includes a $9 million impairment loss for the sale of the industrial UPS business, and $51 million in the fourth quarter or $69 million total transaction expenses for the full year. And we summarize our non-GAAP treatment of these expenses in the reconciliations in the appendix to this presentation. \n Our base Vertiv net sales guidance is up approximately $35 million from our previous guidance based upon improved visibility of our supply and shipment schedules in the fourth quarter. We have also added $55 million incremental net sales from M&A, including $65 million from E+I, offset by $10 million reduced sales from the industrial UPS business divestiture. As Rob mentioned, when we announced the E+I transaction at the beginning of September, we anticipated a December 1 closing date and $45 million of incremental fourth quarter revenue from E+I. Now with the acceleration of the anticipated closing date to November 1, we expect $65 million of incremental E+I revenue in the fourth quarter. \n Adjusted operating profit for base Vertiv is materially in line with our previous guidance at $540 million, with the benefit from higher net sales, offset by higher expected gross material and freight inflation versus our early September guidance. We have added approximately $13 million in operating profit to our guidance for M&A, and that includes $15 million for E+I, assuming a November 1 closing date once again. And that $15 million is offset by approximately $2 million from the sale of the industrial UPS business, expected to close in early December. Compared with last year's fourth quarter, net sales are expected to be up 8%, adjusted operating profit up 16%, with 90 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted EPS is expected to be down approximately $0.02 per share but the year-over-year comparison certainly is negatively impacted by the timing of income tax expense in this year's fourth quarter, which is artificially high due to the quarterly treatment of some nondeductible losses from the changes in the fair value of the warrant liability.\n Next, turning to Slide 11. We summarized our full year 2021 financial guidance, which includes base Vertiv and provision for the M&A activity. Full year net sales are expected to be $5 billion for the full year, and that's up 14% from 2020, including M&A. And the adjusted operating profit for 2021 is expected to be $553 million, up 62% from 2020 and still up 22% when adjusted for the $113 million of 2020 pro forma items. Our full year adjusted operating profit guidance for base Vertiv is unchanged from our previous guidance, so that's at $540 million. And adjusted operating margin for the full year is expected to be 11.1%, up 330 basis points from 2020 and still up 70 basis points when adjusted for 2020 pro forma items. Our full year free cash flow guidance of $205 million remains unchanged from previous guidance. And once again, this includes approximately $45 million of expected M&A cash transaction and closing expenses. \n So with that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Yes. Thanks, Rob. So I think if you look at the numbers and where we stand or where we expect to stand at the end of the fourth quarter is that in a do-nothing scenario, which is not going to happen, in a do-nothing scenario the wraparound effect of net price inflation is probably a small tailwind in the $5 million to $10 million range. So we're certainly encouraged with what we're seeing in the pricing environment here in the fourth quarter. As you mentioned, it's about a $15 million step up from Q3, but we're certainly not satisfied. \n As Rob mentioned, we've left some dollars on the table this year because we've underestimated inflation. And we certainly are going to be much more aggressive, and we have current plans in action to continue those price increases fairly significantly into 2022. But from a wraparound impact looking at the numbers, a floor is probably a $5 million to $10 million tailwind. And of course, we are in our pricing plans, anticipating that inflation will continue to accelerate, whether it does or not, I don't think anybody knows. \n But we're anticipating that it will accelerate. And of course, we anticipate a much more significant dollar tailwind. And I appreciate your comment on the -- as it relates to recapturing the margin percentage. I would say that is our intent, and we do appreciate the math of trying to do that. You could recapture the dollars, but not recapture the percentages. But just to let you know, we are looking at that dynamic as well, and that certainly is our long-term goal. Yes. This is David. Absolutely confirmed that we anticipate 3Q to be the peak net price inflation in balance. And Q3's $40 million, I think it was $25 million in Q2. We anticipate inflation to stay at the same level in Q4, but pricing to ramp up about $15 million. So that imbalance should drop to $25 million for Q4. And if you look at just pure wraparound effect, it would be a $10 million imbalance in Q1 of 2022. But of course, that does not contemplate any additional pricing actions, and we would anticipate to get to a point where those 2 elements offset one another, sometimes in the first quarter. Yes. This is David. So number one, thank you for recognizing that. I would say there's 2 things that are driving the enhancements and margins we think this year. One is definitely centered on the fixed cost constant philosophy. So we continue to not only keep fixed cost constant in EMEA, but we've actually been able to take costs down as it relates to the investment in some of the restructuring. So we certainly see a benefit there from the leverage. \n So with sales up as significant as they are there. And our anticipation for the full year is that they should be in that upper teens sales growth. We certainly are benefiting from that fixed cost leverage. That's probably the primary driver. I mentioned on the call that the supply chain environment in EMEA probably has been a little less disruptive than the other 2 regions, but they still are negative from a contribution margin perspective as it relates to net price cost. I would say most of the lift we've seen this year is because of the fixed cost dynamic. Yes. Thanks, Rob, and thanks for the question, Lance. So as it relates to inventory, you're absolutely right. So if you look at year-to-date inventory, it's probably up $130 million from the end of last year and with approximately $40 million build in the quarter. It's not unusual for us to build inventory during the year and then have that come down in the fourth quarter based on what is usually a very strong sales quarter. I think we're going to see a little bit of that dynamic this year, but probably a little muted. I would anticipate year-end inventory declining somewhat, but very much dependent upon the dynamic out there as it relates to the parts shortage. \n We certainly are not artificially constraining ourselves to hit any internal inventory days or turnover targets. If we can find the parts, we're making the right business decision, and we'll buy the parts, and we'll park in an inventory to protect delivery for 2022. With that said, we're very mindful of the impact that inventory has on free cash flow, a very important metric for us, and we are implementing actions to optimize that inventory level. So I would anticipate a dip in Q1, but we could see an additional build -- I'm sorry, a dip in Q4, and we could see an additional build as we go through the first half of next year. Yes. This is David. So I'll grasp your second question first. So our assumption is that inflation in Q4 is consistent with inflation in Q3. And if you want to put a specific number to it, I think everybody at some point, will be able to triangulate all these numbers on a quarterly basis. But we're assuming $55 million of year-over-year gross inflation in Q4. That was the same number that we saw in Q3. So we don't anticipate that inflation gets any better or worse in Q4 versus Q3, and that's consistent with what we've seen so far in the month of October. \n As it relates to the wraparound effect for 2022, it's a little bit of a math exercise. So that's just looking at -- if you look at that $55 million inflation number we see in Q4, if you wrap that around for the full year, based on what we've seen in 2022, you'll end up with an additional $60 million headwind for inflation. If you do the same thing for pricing, and so to your point, that would only include actions that we see in the P&L in Q4 2021. So that's about $30 million. if you wrap that around, you get a $65 million tailwind for pricing. And that's the $5 million to $10 million that we referenced. It's kind of a pure math exercise. Just to give comfort that, that's really the floor that we would see on a base case. But of course, that does not contemplate pricing actions that we've taken in Q4 that have not been recognized in the P&L yet. It also assumes that inflation does not get worse. But we thought that would just be kind of a helpful gauge for what would a floor number would be. This is David, I will start, and Rob and Gary can speak. So I would say, if you look at the dynamics of both pricing and inflation for 2021, Americas has certainly been impacted more than the other 2 regions. And once again ... Yes. This is David. I would say nothing that we've seen with E+I up to this point has changed our view for 2022 and our expectations for financials. We'll certainly give an update and include that in our guidance when we announce 4Q. But I would say, nothing we have seen has changed our expectations for next year. Yes. This is David, Steve. We can work with you on that. There's sometimes an element of rounding in there as well. So our backlog was up close to $200 million in the quarter. The book-to-bill was clearly in that 115%, 120% range. But we have made no significant adjustments as it relates to the backlog, meaning booked orders coming out. There is sometimes an FX component to it that creates some noise. But I would say there's nothing significantly that has changed with how we calculate backlog."

            "name": "Rob Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. The reviews that you continue to conduct with me and the team always leave us in a better place, and our business is actually in a much better place because of your involvement. So all of you on today's call, thank you for being here. I'm eager for you to hear more about our 2021 third quarter performance, our outlook on the market and an update on our portfolio. There are 6 key messages I want to convey today. \n First, as Dave mentioned, demand for Vertiv products and services remain strong. During our last earnings call, we reported second quarter sales were up more than 25% and orders were up 24% compared to the second quarter of last year. I'm pleased to report that sales and orders are up again in Q3. Sales were up 6%, which is very much in line with the guidance we provided in our last update and orders were up 17%. In addition, our Q3 backlog rose to $2.4 billion, the highest it's ever been. \n Second, profitability is up. This quarter, our adjusted operating profit was $131 million, up $64 million from last year's third quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of 490 basis points. \n Third, year-to-date free cash flow is greater today than it was this time last year. Free cash flow for Q3 was $44 million and year-to-date is $128 million. For a year -- from a year-to-date perspective, this represents an improvement of over $140 million versus the first 3 quarters of 2020. \n Fourth, as Dave mentioned, we are dealing, like others, with supply chain and inflationary issues. We encountered supply chain challenges in Q3 and experienced commodity and freight inflation. We made spot buys so that we can meet our delivery commitments we've made to our customers, and we have implemented strategies to recapture those costs. Pricing always lagged cost by a few quarters, and that's exactly what we're seeing now. However, we believe, as we've mentioned before, pricing will be a tailwind in 2022.  \n Fifth. We expect to close the E+I acquisition by November 1, which is a month earlier than previously communicated. In addition, we've signed an agreement to sell our heavy industrial UPS business, and we expect to close that transaction by the end of Q4. \n And the final key message is, we are confirming our latest guidance for the Vertiv base and slightly increasing our guidance for the impact of the M&A transaction. \n Turning to Slide 4. This is the chart we use to illustrate what we're seeing in each of our world regions in each of our end markets. In the cloud and hyperscale colocation markets, they continue to remain strong as evidenced by the green buttons. The demand for digital continues to fuel the industry and is driving a strong and growing need for Vertiv products and services. \n In our enterprise and small to medium business market, we continue to see signs of progress. Enough progress is made in Americas to upgrade this segment from yellow to green. We continue to experience an increase in the pipeline and orders with Americas leading the way. The communication networks had a few moments. We saw 5G deployments in earlier parts of the year being very robust and began to see that slow or a digestion over the last quarter or so. We've experienced Europe beginning to deploy 5G, and we see consistent deployment in Americas. In the commercial and industrial markets, things remain consistent. While this is a smaller size of our business, the variety of products and services we sell here continue to expand. \n Moving to Slide 5. As referenced in my opening slide, our order rates continue to be robust. Our Q3 order rates were up 17% over Q3 of 2020 and on a year-to-date basis are up 21% versus the same time period last time with cloud and colocation segment leading our way. Vertiv's executive team remains closely connected to the accounts, and we're seeing the strong demand continue. Because of the deliberate connections we are making, we are gaining further visibility into customer demand, leading to advanced orders and insight to their future pipelines that we haven't seen in the past, which is a tremendous help in our demand planning as we go forward. This and other actions we are taking have led to a record backlog, as I mentioned earlier, of $2.4 billion, which is 34% higher than our backlog was at the end of 2020. \n As you heard from Dave in his opening comments, supply chain continues to pose challenges for us and many, many others in the industry. Each of the regions are experiencing it, but it is most acute in Americas, where material availability is most difficult and commodity prices have risen beyond expectations. Where necessary, we'll continue to use spot buys so that we can take care of our customers. From a pricing standpoint, we are in line with our prior guidance we provided for Q4. We'll continue with pricing actions throughout 2022. \n Moving to Slide 6. When we spoke last, we expected to close the E+I deal by December 1, but I'm very pleased that we will be able to close this deal a month earlier due to the diligence of the combined Vertiv and E+I teams and with help from our transaction partners. We had successfully -- we had a successful debt raise a few weeks back, and all antitrust hurdles have been cleared. The market reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Gary, Phil, our Regional President, I have been on the phone with hundreds of customers and the receptivity to the deal is exactly what we wanted, very optimistic and very excited. Integration planning has started right after the deal was signed, and I look forward to entering into the execution mode in a few days. While E+I orders remain very strong, they are facing site readiness and supply issues on electric components, no different than others in the industry.  \n Now let's turn to divestitures of the heavy-duty industrial UPS business. We have signed an agreement to sell this business to a financial sponsor called InnovaFonds. InnovaFonds will retain the existing management team, which makes for a very easy transition and provides for great customer continuity. We expect this transaction, as mentioned early, to close by the end of Q4. \n With that, I'll turn it over to David to take a closer look at the Q3 numbers and we'll come back with some final comments at the end. David? Well, thanks, David. Let's turn to Slide 12. Well, almost all the commentary thus far has been focused on 2021. We did want to provide an early glimpse of 2022, which we're really excited about. From a top line perspective, we clearly enter the year with a backlog that's significantly higher than what we came into in 2021. And from my view, right now, the backlog will be approximately $500 million higher than previous. \n As discussed on the earlier slide, our markets continue to show strong demand for our products. All signs are pruning to cloud and colocation markets remaining robust globally. And from an enterprise perspective, demand should continue at the same pace we're seeing it today. During our last few calls, we highlighted some of the Vertiv product development initiatives we have underway. And these products only accelerate in 2022 and beyond. We continue to invest in new product development and go-to-market strategies. From a potential headwind standpoint, we're expecting to see parts shortages last at least through the first half of next year. We also know customers are dealing with trade labor shortages and difficulty in getting some of the key building materials that they need. While it's difficult to predict the exact impact on us. These are very real issues and our customers are dealing with them on a day-to-day basis. \n As for profitability in 2022, we expect pricing will be a tailwind. We will have a full year of E+I in our results, which will be accretive. We will continue to deploy the tenants of VOS, fixed cost constant and as mentioned earlier, still funding incremental R&D and growth initiatives. We do expect inflation to continue into 2022. But even at today's level, we are planning next year to be net positive on price. \n Turning to Slide 13. As I close, I want you to know how proud I am with the Vertiv team and what we together as 1 Vertiv, have accomplished in the first 9 months. The results we've shared today are reflective of the hard work and commitment of our 20,000 employees globally, some of the factories, some in the field, some in the offices and some still working remotely in over 130 countries. \n As I look at the remaining month of 2021, as we continue to invest strategically, I'm confident we will see above-market top line growth, increase in profitability and strengthening in our balance sheet. When I look down the road at 2022 and beyond, my confidence is bolstered by the conversations I've had personally with partners and customers around the globe about demand, pricing and future pipelines. \n To all employees, I'm grateful for you and the part you played in the past 3 months that have allowed me to provide today's earnings report. Thank you for your dedication and your tireless efforts to take care of the customer. To our investors, thank you all for being on the call today. Thank you for your trust and support. It's truly my pleasure to be leading Vertiv. \n I'll now turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for questions. Jeff, this is Rob. I'll start first, and then David and Gary can chime in. First of all, I'd like to start off by saying that we, and it's on me, have under-forecasted what inflation was going to do. And therefore, we haven't received the pricing level necessary to offset inflation in previous quarters. I can assure you going forward with our robust pricing actions and what we are doing now and we'll be doing in 2022 that we will be positive in price based on what we're executing on. So again, I just wanted to let everyone know on the call today that under forecasted inflation, we understand where that's at. We're even assuming that it could get potentially worse and we're making sure that our pricing actions now and going forward cover that. David? Sure, Jeff. This is Rob. I'll start off and then Gary might add some additional color. What we're seeing right now, and especially in Americas, as we mentioned, is kind of a rebound of small to medium business and enterprise as they go back to work, refreshing their networks, their network closets. So we've seen that activity in the channel space for us beginning to pick up. And that's why we moved it from yellow to green. We're also seeing in the enterprise areas, people reconfiguring their data centers, taking the time projects they probably put on hold during the pandemic and now they're getting back to some new builds, some reconfiguration on build as they build out their hybrid cloud strategies going forward and rightsize, I guess, I would say, the current data centers that will be on-prem. \n So that's what really gives us confidence led by Americas, haven't seen parts of Asia, we didn't talk much about because Asia, as you know, is still being played on and off with COVID. We expect, hopefully, going into Q1 next year, Q2, that those activities that COVID would clear itself up and we could see enterprise going in the right direction there. And in Europe, we're continuing to execute on our channel strategy there to drive more and more enterprise business. But in general, corporations are spending money. They are taking care of their infrastructure now that people are getting back into the office. No, Scott, absolutely. And I think you kind of nailed it. While we don't know exactly which sites are going to be impacted. What we are seeing is customers willing to take that inventory in some cases and warehouses, so they have it when that site does turn on so they don't lose their production slot or they don't lose their equipment to somebody else. That being said, that's more of a new phenomenon. And as I reach out to more of our large customers, more and more of them are wanting some type of program to have inventory go ahead and take it off our hands and take the responsibility of it. \n But it's a really dynamic situation. And even things as roofing systems, which you think would be simple have gone out to 44 weeks in lead times. So they are being stressed not by necessarily the equipment manufacturers. If I look at the lead times, yes, they've gone out, but not near as far as some of these other base building materials that they need for their sites. That being said, our business is a combination of new builds and brownfields, and we feel good about that. But some of the larger projects will experience site difficulties from time to time due to trade labor and so on. Yes. There's been spot places where we've seen somebody had to have something and somebody was willing to jump the line and maybe a competitor willing to jump the line and knock another customer out. We've been very honorable with what we've told our customers and we've not played that game. So I'd say while that's happening, it's very little. I mean the market is tight for everybody. And we've seen, without going into detail, smaller competitors and even larger competitors -- we commit. \n As you know, we were one of the first companies to come out and talk about this issue, and we did it around the announcement of the acquisition because we felt that was fair and honest to let you guys know exactly what we're seeing. But I don't think we're penalized any worse than anybody else, and the backlog will continue to grow. And quite honestly, people will continue to drive further visibility. And I mentioned that earlier in my discussions, I like the visibility we're getting. \n The industry has traditionally not shared that because they feel it's a competitive issue because we work with a lot of competitors -- to our customers and they want to make sure. But what we're finding is building those relationships and that collaborative relationship, we're able to get even a longer view into the builds and locations, which is going to help us in the future of our planning and expansion of capacity. Yes, I would absolutely agree with what you just said. And then it kind of falls in line with what we're saying about enterprise. And enterprise should be stronger next year as we began to see the things pick up and continue to grow our channel business. As it relates to -- and we get asked this all the time and that -- what's happening is this -- there's always been a build and fill situation where we have this absorption going on and what's different, why is it different now? \n You're absolutely right, colo and hyperscalers, more money is being poured into that. The utilization rates are high. What's going to be the limiting factor for the growth, not necessarily orders growth, but growth on the sales side and delivery is going to be that material and labor shortages on probably their end. \n But at the end of the day, the appetite as far as I can see out and we typically have 18 to 24 months look ahead on the pipeline and things like that, looks very robust. And that's why I'm very bullish right now that get these supply issues behind us, which are a big nuisance for all of us. And get moving forward, the market needs more critical data centers. Nigel, this is Rob. I'll start up here. Well, we're seeing a robust backlog. Again, a lot of 2022 is going to be dependent on supply and site  readiness and capability. So not ready to commit on a 2022 number. But looking at our backlog and the orders growth, it certainly would imply a robust 2022, assuming we can deliver. China is -- moving to China, a lot of stuff in the news about what's going on with China, how they're cracking down on some of the hyperscale activities. Certainly, the power outages because of the coal issues which has not been affecting us currently right now because we're deemed essential, and we continue to run as we provide. \n It is a dynamic environment over there. And as you know, when China decides to do something and put a stimulus in like they did in the beginning of the year for 5G growth and some other things, we do see kind of a higher-than-average growth. But in general, we feel good about our position, our focus on product development, being local there and continue to grow our share there. Lance, thanks for the question. This is Rob. I'll take the first half, and I'll give David the second half on that. As it relates to the growth, and I think we talked last time when we announced the E+I acquisition, we're posting up around 12% orders growth. We did see an acceleration. I would say it's hard to kind of break out, I'd say, right now, the price and that certainly, there's some price in there, but we're seeing a strong strength in demand. Part of that is people are placing POs as we are as a company, a little further ahead in the future so that they make sure they get in line. But in general, the market is pretty robust. As you see -- begin to see the comment that someone made earlier around the CapEx that the hyperscalers and colo companies are spending. So certainly, there's some price in there for sure, but there's also just a strong underlying growth in the market. David, second half? Nicole, it seems like your name is coming through some variation also. Nicole. I'll take that. From a revenue growth perspective, EMEA has had some, I would say, very good tailwinds basically produced by our -- what we call our global accounts team that we've pulled together. So we've seen an aggressive build-out across Europe partially due to sovereignty, partially due to some of the Brexit activities early on and just everyone wanting data centers. So you're seeing a tremendous amount of bills happening in Europe as we speak today. That being said, the outlook as we look and look at our pipeline, as I mentioned, we've got pretty good views. I expect robust growth to be happening really around the globe. \n I expect Americas, a lot of people think Americas is done and built out, that is not the case. There's more data centers needed than we currently have today. And I think you'll see an acceleration of growth in 2022 for that, both colo and hyperscale and as enterprise recovers. And then if you look at Asia, Southeast Asia, specifically, they've been -- COVID has really slowed them down from the ability to build, deliver projects. So I think when that gets unlocked, you'll see a nice set of growth there. And then we commented on China earlier. I can't -- I wish I had a better crystal ball to tell exactly what was going to happen over there, but we continue to see that as a good market for us. Sure, Mark. This is Rob. Thanks for the question. Yes, in general, the excitement is it actually fills out the portfolio. While we've talked about it in the past that switchgear wasn't necessarily something we had to have. as the systems get more tightly integrated as we put the controls and drive efficiency, modularity, which we've been talking about for a while, these modular integrated data center is becoming more and more part of it. So they're excited the fact that a company of Vertiv size with our service organization, which E+I didn't have a lot of service organization, we can really kind of complete that entire deal for them. \n The bus bar category was something that we didn't really participate much in, and E+I is a global leader in providing bus bar. And the excitement, I would say, when we talk to a lot of the global colos and hyperscale is the fact that we'll help accelerate and bring these products to all places in the world. E+I haven't really been very present at all. They don't have a factory in India in China or rest of Asia. So the fact that they can now get global consistency, global products and the modularity side of it is a big one. \n E+I has done just an incredible job in Europe, providing modular power skids. They've got a new facility opened in South Carolina, which have been receiving orders for modular. So it gives us that capability that in some areas we do ourselves like, for example, in Europe, Croatia. But in areas in the U.S., we would sub that out maybe to a third party and have them assemble our equipment and pull that together. Now we'll have that in-house capability and that core thing. So in general, it wasn't anything to do with the exception of -E+I is a great company. Now it's even better with the backing of Vertiv services and Vertiv sales and Vertiv's global reach. Sure. And this is an ever-changing environment. So we have been speaking in the past about fan situations. Our engineering teams work diligently to qualify additional fan manufacturers to bring into our build and bring into our products. So some of the things have eased up and actually beginning to get better as we bring some new suppliers on. I would say that still neutral on where we talked about chips, working with our chip manufacturers and that capacity coming online end of the year coming into Q1, Q2. Again, mixed bag on what people are saying in the market. But as we talk to our suppliers there, they feel like that they'll have the capacity beginning to come on middle to the end of Q2 from that. \n As we think about breakers, which we all use, breakers, and there's a few circuit breaker manufacturers on a global basis, that seems to have gotten worse from a supply perspective versus when we talked before, I think -- I'm not sure that it's bottomed out, but I think it probably is getting close to that from a lead time going out. \n And then some of the things that maybe are getting better, but still spotty is the IGBTs, which we've talked about in the past and some of that was just due to the fact that COVID was affecting some of the factories in Vietnam and other parts of the world, and we'll see them coming back online. So in general, maybe a few parts and a little more detail here probably one of a few parts getting a little bit worse from a lead time perspective and some things improving. And, again, our thoughts are, while we don't have a perfect crystal ball if all the things were -- being told from the supply base, things should begin to get better for the second half, which we talked about for next year. I'll start with second one first, and then Gary can comment a little bit about some of the win rates. But I'll tell you that we're very excited about some of the new products that we've talked about in the past that have launched, that have been received quite well. One area that I've been excited about is our thermal managing area where we continue to be a world leader and the global supplier of that. The dynamics of changing of what people want to use in the data center. \n While a lot of people are staying away from water, we have a really good system that is waterless, very efficient that helps them drive towards their carbon-neutral platform. That would be one example that we talked about in the past, and we've seen a better then expected uptick of that. So people are liking the innovation, we're liking what we're bringing out. \n I would say in the channel side of things as well, the solutions that we've been bringing to the channel, whether it's first in some of the lithium-ion battery products, our Geist, kind of our award-winning power distribution product line, has had several launches that have picked up. So in general, I guess, I am more than thrilled with what we've delivered so far, and really excited as Dave mentioned, Cote. We continue to pull gas on the fire for innovation, and we'll continue to deliver those products, both in channel and in the colo, hyperscale and enterprise base. Gary? Great question. And a lot of people read into hyperscalers and what they're doing. And certainly, one of the areas that the hyperscalers have spent time and innovation on is around the servers themselves, the servers, the storage and doing a lot of that development themselves, doing their own chips. Several have announced that. As it relates to infrastructure, we do a lot of collaboration with them. there's certainly hyperscalers, some want things down exactly the way they want them. And so we're a collaborator or provider using our IP and in some cases, a mixture of joint IP, but for the most part, our IP. \n So we don't see them going in a big way into our space as it relates to large power, large thermal, but we do see them influencing our Vertiv product development as we go forward from that perspective. As it relates to technologies which you're referring to with 3M is really their 2-phase immersion cooling fluid that they've talked about, and we see that really originating in bitcoin operations where there's really high-density, super high density servers and immersion cooling is just yet another way to take the heat out in a high-density situation. If you think about the landscape, it will continue to evolve. \n And while we're involved with immersion cooling, and I think I've talked about this before with the single Phase III -- II Phase, we're involved in both of those as part of our R&D, and we're deploying and we have partners there. I think if you think about where the industry will continue to change and evolve is one of our sweet spots, and that's the thermal, continue to whether it's immersion, whether it's cold plates and some cooling at the chip level, all those things Vertiv's engaged with and very forward thinking on things that are going to be 2 to 3 years out. So we feel good about that. \n The other area that I think you'll see a focus on is generators, right? Generators is an area that creates a lot of concern and they're not looked upon as favorable for siding and so forth. So maybe alternate ways of doing tighter integration with renewables and even things such as fuel cells, which I wouldn't have thought in my lifetime would become -- began to become more mainstay. But with fuel cells and solar and wind and battery storage, those are some of the things, I think if you look at the future, they have been talked about by a lot of the hyperscalers and colos and certainly, Vertiv with its increased R&D budgets are participating in collaboration and making sure we have a place in that game. Well again, thank you for all being here today, and thank you for your continued support. As you can tell, we're pretty excited about what we're going into for 2022. We'll get through these supply issues, and we'll continue to invest in our R&D and continue to bring new products to market that has the innovation that our customers are looking for. So thanks again. Have a great day."

You can see from the press that demand remains strong in almost every end market and ours is very strong, especially with our new product initiatives. In the short term, we have to continue to fight the battles for component parts to support our customers, and we need to get ahead of the price inflation curve that Rob will tell you more about. While this is a painful and an irritating time to deal with, it is what it is. And I can assure you, we will come out of this admirably, especially given our investments in the long term. \n We're obviously enthused about the E+I acquisition, which we will do very well with. Gary and I were down in the E+I facility at South Carolina a few weeks ago with Phil brainstorming and reviewing the cost and revenue synergies we know we can create over the next several years. In addition to the synergy review, we discussed the investments we can make in further products and services, process improvements, people and systems that will pay dividends over the medium and long term. \n There is a lot happening in the business that portends a superb future. So while we continue planning and executing for the future, we recognize we also got to get through the current situation and do everything we can to continue supporting our customers, which we will do. \n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\n I'll now turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem.\n Before we begin, I point out that during the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement, our proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Good morning, everyone. I know I've said this many times, but I truly believe it, though, I guess I'm going to continue to say it. Vertiv is a great company and is in a really good industry. No company, no industry is ever perfect, of course, but from what I've seen over the last 8 years, I am very pleased with the company, the management team and the industry.\n Vertiv continues to make all of the right investments in product development in the Vertiv User Experience, in the Vertiv Operating System and many more arenas, which are all areas that will pay off more in the future than they even have to date. Truly is personifying the winning now winning later mantra that you all know is so important to me.\n The focus on today and tomorrow at the same time is especially true as Rob and his team focus on taking care of customers. It's an age old concept, but it sure has been proven to be true. And if you do a great job of taking care of customers, that is one of the best long-term strategies you can have.\n So it is costing us something to do, as you can see from the numbers, with those [ flat back eyes ] that Rob and his team have had to do to. But all of us are absolutely convinced it's the right thing to do. Taking care of customers today and tomorrow every way you can is clearly a winning strategy.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thanks, Dave, and thanks for your guidance that you provide both to me and to my executive team in supporting Vertiv in all the ways that you do. We are better and a stronger company having you as our Executive Chairman. To all of you on today's call, thank you for being here. And I'm eager to share with you our performance for the 2021 second quarter, our outlook on the market and information about a few of our growth initiatives that we're driving at Vertiv.\n There are 5 key messages I want to convey today. And David Fallon, our CFO, will take you into a deeper dive of the financials in just a few minutes. First of all, demand for Vertiv products and services is strong. During our last earnings call, we reported first quarter sales that were up more than 22% and orders that were up 21% compared to the first quarter of last year.\n I am pleased to report that the sales and orders are up again in Q2. Sales were up 25% and orders were up over 24%. Having sales and orders growth in excess of 20% in the back-to-back quarters demonstrates our customer-first approach and that it is paying off. In addition, our Q2 backlog rose to $2.3 billion, the highest it's ever been.\n Second, profitability is up. This quarter, our adjusted operating profit was $134 million, which is up $31 million or 30% from last year's second quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Third, Year-to-date free cash flow is greater today than it was this time last year. Free cash flow for Q2 was $41 million and year-to-date, $84 million. From a year-to-date perspective, this represents an improvement of over $225 million versus the first half of 2020.\n Fourth, we are dealing with supply chain issues and inflation issues. We encountered supply chain challenges in Q2 and experienced commodity and freight inflation. As Dave mentioned, we made spot buys so that we can meet the delivery commitments to serve our customers and we've implemented strategies to recapture cost. Pricing always lags cost by a quarter or 2, and that's exactly what we're seeing now. I have a slide coming up with more details on this.\n And finally, the key message, we're raising our 2021 guidance by $100 million in sales and $5 million in adjusted operating profit. This action demonstrates the confidence we have in our end markets and also reflects the priority we're placing on customer pursuit and capture. In addition, we are balancing the timing of incremental pricing coming into the P&L.\n Turning to Page 4. We've been using this slide each quarter to illustrate what we are seeing in each of our world regions and each of our end markets. As we said before, Red button indicates sluggish performance. The green button indicates strong performance, and the yellow button indicates somewhere in between. For the second quarter in a row, there are no reds.\n Let's take each market. Cloud and hyperscale and our colocation markets remain strong. The demand for digital applications continue to fuel the industry and is driving strong and a growing need for Vertiv products and services. In our enterprise small and medium business market, we continue to see signs of progress as it works to recover from the pandemic. We are experiencing an increase in pipeline and orders. If the current pace of activity continues in this upward trajectory, we will be able to upgrade a few of the markets that are yellow to green on our next call.\n The communication network stayed constant in all regions. 5G deployments and trials are continuing as are the starts and stops of customer deployments. These will provide tailwinds for us over the next few years. In the commercial and industrial market, things remain constant. While this is the smallest slice of our business, the variety of products and services we sell here continues to strengthen. All in all, the end markets we serve have remained steady.\n Moving on to Slide 5. I want to provide a little bit of color around demand as we're seeing it and give you a glimpse of 2 of growth investments. As mentioned earlier, overall market demand is strong, as indicated by our order rates and record backlog. This scenario led us to raise our guidance.\n Each of our regions saw revenue growth in the second quarter, led by continued strength in the cloud and colocation markets. Our cloud and colocation customers continue to build data centers in an aggressive but balanced fashion, and we continue to partner with them to meet the strong and growing demand. We are receiving every opportunity to capture long-term customer commitments and investing in spot buys, as Dave mentioned, to procure essential product components to take care of the delivery for our customers.\n Moving to the column on the right and to our growth investments. I want to talk about 2 specific investments. First, our IT channel business; and second, our Vertiv Product Development initiative. For the channel, our channel is growing and is part of our strategy and our growth strategy for our business. We have spent time in listening to our partners.\n We fine-tuned our strategy. We've built a new partner portal, developed augmented reality sales tools, added configurators, increased sales support and ramped up our digital presence in a quest to make Vertiv easy for our partners to do business with. These efforts are definitely paying dividends. Existing partnerships are being strengthened. New partnerships are being formed, and all partners are promoting Vertiv. By the numbers, we had a 50% increase in the number of resellers that are actively buying our products since this time last year. Customer base is up over 400% from Q2 of last year.\n A second example of how one of our growth initiatives is performing can be illustrated with this customer success story. Green Mountain is a European colocation provider. Green Mountain recently selected Vertiv as a supplier for our, as they call it, our cutting-edge technology. A key executive from Green Mountain has gone on to say the sustainability of the product and the suppliers is a key factor when purchasing new equipment. Vertiv technologies are the most efficient I've seen, and this will further improve our overall sustainability.\n The investments we are making in our Vertiv Product Development growth initiatives are helping us develop more cutting-edge and energy efficiency technologies for innovation, sustainability and expanding our list of customers. These are just 2 examples that demonstrate the progress we are making as we drive focus, resources on growth and investment areas.\n Moving on to Slide 6. Well, pricing is never easy task, but this market has required it. We are estimating having $65 million of pricing actions for the full year versus 2020. As you can see, though, by the time we get to Q4, we will have pricing that fully offset inflationary costs.\n Moving to the second column. Inflation is being felt by us in material, freight cost and spot buys. Approximately $60 million in materials, $15 million in freight and $35 million in spot buys. We expect the cost impacts to ramp down in 2022 driving net tailwinds. David will provide additional commentary.\n The third column depicts how we expect our contribution margin to evolve over the next 2 quarters. The timing of pricing versus inflation causing a dip in Q2. The pricing actions will accelerate in Q3, driving margin recovery. We anticipate full recovery by Q4 as headwinds stabilize and the pricing plan is fully implemented. And as mentioned, we're expecting a net tailwind in 2022 for this activity. So while we've experienced some short-term cost impacts, pricing is coming and customer investments we are making in are in the short term and will, over the long term, continue to drive shareholder value.\n With that, I'll turn it over to David for a closer look at our Q2 numbers, and we'll come back at the end with some final comments. David? \nDavid Fallon: Great. Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were up $254 million or 25% and 20% when adjusted for a $50 million foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with second quarter orders, as Rob mentioned, which were up 24% after increasing over 20% in the first quarter.\n Adjusted operating profit increased $31 million or 30%, primarily driven by the profit flow-through from higher sales. However, as discussed, our contribution margin in the second quarter was negatively influenced by material and freight inflation, which impacted our second quarter P&L in advance of much of the favorable pricing expected to materially benefit the second half of the year. The negative impact of net inflation on contribution margin in the second quarter was approximately $25 million with another $10 million impacting contribution margin driven by the plant inefficiencies driven by the supply chain environment.\n Fixed costs were up $20 million from last year's second quarter, including $30 million from last year's onetime COVID cost actions and $20 million from incremental growth in ER&D investments, both partially offset by continued fixed cost reduction initiatives and an impairment of capitalized software recognized in last year's second quarter.\n Our adjusted earnings per share increased $0.15 to $0.31, primarily on the strength of higher adjusted operating profit and lower interest and income tax expense. Free cash flow was down $20 million from last year's second quarter. But as we discussed in our first quarter conference call, free cash flow in the first quarter was positively impacted by $25 million due to the delay of the cash disbursement at the end of the first quarter as a result of the systems implementation. And of course, this timing also negatively impacted second quarter free cash flow by the same $25 million. Otherwise, free cash flow would have been in line with last year's second quarter.\n Turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $80 million or 16.5%, driven by strong double-digit growth across all 3 product segments. Net sales in APAC were up $75 million or 23%, with growth across most of the APAC subregions, product segments and market verticals.\n Net sales in EMEA were up $99 million or an impressive 50%, 41% organic, predominantly in the critical infrastructure and solutions products segment driven by several larger colocation projects. From a profitability perspective, adjusted operating margin declined in both the Americas and APAC, with both regions negatively impacted by material and freight inflation with Americas disproportionately impacted due to regional differences in commodity markets and higher electronic spot buys to support a larger channel business.\n Adjusted operating profit improved in EMEA despite inflation challenges due to the leverage benefit of lower fixed costs on a significantly higher net sales base. Once again, this demonstrates the margin benefit of maintaining or reducing fixed costs while growing the top line. You may have heard the philosophy of keeping fixed cost constant. So this is once again, a real applicable example of that.\n Next turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges second quarter free cash flow from last year. The year-over-year benefit from higher adjusted operating profit and lower cash interest payments was more than offset by several unfavorable variances including $20 million in cash taxes driven by lower estimated payments in last year's second quarter, primarily due to COVID uncertainty.\n And we also had an additional $18 million outflow from inventory as we have proactively invested in inventory to satisfy customer demand in this challenging supply chain environment. Despite the unfavorable quarterly year-over-year comparison, year-to-date free cash flow is still $225 million higher than the same period last year. Last on this slide, we ended the second quarter with a record high liquidity of $1.1 billion and a record low net leverage -- net debt leverage ratio of 2.2x.\n Next turning to Slide 10. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial guidance. We expect first half top line momentum to continue into the third quarter, with net sales up 10% at the midpoint, including a double-digit growth in EMEA and upper single-digit growth in Americas and APAC. So we expect the growth momentum to continue to cross all 3 regions.\n This sales guidance assumes $25 million year-over-year benefit from pricing. And that's probably a little bit more proportionately directed at the Americas versus the other 2 regions. We guide towards adjusted operating profit of $160 million at the midpoint, up $92 million from last year. But as a reminder, we recognized an $80 million combined charge in last year's third quarter for restructuring and an asset impairment. This adjusted operating profit guidance assumes that the third quarter benefit from pricing does not quite offset the negative impact from inflation. However, we do anticipate a full offset pricing versus inflation in the fourth quarter.\n Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to increase approximately $0.23 at the midpoint, primarily driven by the $8 million restructuring and asset impairment charge in last year's third quarter as the EPS benefits from incremental volume are offset by headwinds from net price inflation and last year's COVID actions, which were still $10 million in the third quarter of 2020.\n Next turning to Slide 11. We summarize our revised full year 2021 financial guidance, including net sales of $5 billion, up 14% from 2020 and $100 million higher than our prior guidance. We are increasing our adjusted operating profit guidance to $600 million, up $5 million from prior guidance. And we will provide some detail of dollar increase on the next slide. We are taking down our full year estimate for adjusted operating margin by approximately 10 basis points at the midpoint. There are several moving pieces to our updated operating profit guidance, which certainly impact operating margin.\n Some of these are favorable; some are unfavorable as illustrated on the next slide. But in the macro, the reduction is driven by the additional net inflation and related costs, offset by fixed cost actions we have initiated, including controlling discretionary spending.\n For the avoidance of any doubt, we are reaffirming our adjusted operating margin targets of 16% in the intermediate term and 20% in the long term. We believe the net inflation headwind is an unfortunate 2021 dynamic due to constrained supply chains coming out of COVID. And we believe the pricing actions we are implementing today will generate a nice tailwind for 2022. And we are certainly incurring costs today to satisfy customer needs currently, and I'm referring to the spot buys and expedited freight, that we consider a long-term investment in our customer relationships, which can be referenced as winning later.\n Even though it is hypothetical, at least on paper without the $45 million net inflation headwinds, we could be discussing adjusted operating profit in the $645 million range for 2020 as growth remains robust, with net sales now expected to be $225 million at the midpoint higher than our beginning-of-the-year estimates.\n Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.15, $0.04 higher than our prior full year guidance, driven by the $5 million increase in adjusted operating profit, about $0.01, and $11 million lower full year tax expense contributing about $0.03. And that was primarily the result of a discrete tax benefit that we recognized in the second quarter.\n Finally, we are maintaining our full year projected free cash flow guidance of $300 million, which is up almost $140 million from full year 2020. We discussed internally whether we should increase our full year free cash flow guidance, but we are holding flat due to uncertainty in the supply chain, we generally realize a really nice cash inflow in the fourth quarter from the reduction of inventory, but we want to wait another quarter to see how that plays out for this year. With that said, we do like the upper end of the range of our $290 million to $310 million free cash flow full year guidance.\n Next, turning to Slide 12. This chart bridges our full year adjusted operating profit from prior guidance of $5 million increase. On the prior slide, we noted a $100 million net sales increase. The components of this increase include $40 million of pricing mostly in the second half, $15 million of foreign exchange translation almost entirely in the second quarter and $45 million of volume with $35 million of that in the second quarter and $10 million in the second half. The $40 million of pricing is depicted in the first green bar.\n The second green bar reflects the benefits of various fixed cost reduction actions we implemented in the second quarter, including controlling discretionary spending, and this should benefit the remainder of 2021. The third green bar reflects the expected flow-through from the $40 million to $45 million incremental organic volume.\n The 2 largest red bars on this page reflect our updated views on the impact of supply chain challenges in 2021. This represents combined about $65 million of higher cost compared to our previous guidance with an incremental $20 million realized in the second quarter and $45 million added to the second half. Finally, on this slide, the last red bar on the right reflects expected headwinds from our prior guidance related to timing delays in productivity, both in purchasing and in the plant as a result of the current supply chain environment.\n With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Rob? \nRob Johnson: Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 13, which is our last slide, recap the key messages for the quarter. As I close, I want you to know how proud I am with the Vertiv team and what we're doing together as a one Vertiv company. We've accomplished a great first half of the year. The results we've shared today reflect the hard work and commitment of the 20,000 employees, some in the factories, some in the field and some in the offices and some still working remotely in over 130 countries around the world.\n As I look at the remaining months of 2021 and as we continue to invest strategically, I'm confident that we'll see above-market top line growth and increase in profitability and a strengthening balance sheet. When I look down the road at 2022 and beyond, my confidence is bolstered by the conversations that I've had personally with partners and key customers about the demand, pricing and pipeline.\n To all employees, I'm grateful for the part you've played in the past 3 months and have allowed me to provide today's earnings report. Thank you for your dedication and your tireless effort to take care of our customers. To our investors, thank you for being on the call today and for your trust and support in Vertiv. It is truly my pleasure to be leading Vertiv.\n I will now turn the call over to the operator who will open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: So surprise, surprise, a question on price. So the $65 million, how do we interpret that? Are these actions already made to the customers? And Obviously, there's an assumption about how much fixed and how much is given away in, I don't know, concessions, et cetera. Is this $65 million sort of like what's been actioned and what we hope to get? Or is this a conservative view on sort of how much of this price mix? And then maybe just talk about Americas versus APAC and EMEA. \nRob Johnson: Okay. Nigel, thanks for your question. This is Rob. I'll start off and then let Gary and David weigh in. Pricing actions were actually underway at the beginning of Q2 as we begin to see this inflationary environment. As you know, we feed a lot off of our backlog. And some of those things in our backlog, we can look at price, we can look at freight. But for the most part, as we've indicated on the call, you'll see that really kind of come to life in Q3 and Q4. So we know orders that we got in Q2 that we'll ship in Q3, Q4, Q1, we know we got price on those. So that's why we feel confident that we will get the price and we are getting the price. So that's the first thing.\n The same thing we've done which has been talked about widely with industrials is the ability to get price in the channel and distribution. That's a much faster lever from that perspective. But for us, as a company compared to other industrials, we're a smaller player in that, but that's an area that we're growing fast.\n So we have taken pricing actions in some cases, 3 times within that space that will -- we've seen stick, and we've seen our order growth rates, as you can see in our channels beginning to grow at the pace that we've talked about in the past. We expect to continue to take share in that space while we continue to raise price and drive that. I don't know, any other comments, Gary or David? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. Nigel, Gary here. I think Rob hit the nail on the head. The only 2 other parts I'd add to your question are we do think most of the pricing that we're going to get right now is sticky. It's not going to be 100%, but the majority of that pricing should be sticky as we head into 2022. And as Rob mentioned in his opening comments, that should provide some tailwind for us throughout that next year.\n And then secondly, regional breakdown, I think the other part of your question was. There's a good chunk of this pricing, the majority of it that sits in Americas. So we're taking actions in all 3 regions. But just to your regional mix question, there certainly is a majority of the pricing that's going to happen in the Americas as well. \nNigel Coe: That's great. And then a quick one on your comments on 2022. Obviously, we're a little bit early to start talking about 2022. But the tailwind that you alluded to, is it really more a case of the spot purchases and the export of freight going away so we get that $35 million tailwind? Or do you see other benefits next year? \nRob Johnson: I think we see that as well as we see continued -- the pricing that we're getting now for stuff that's going to be rolling out in 2022. And my comments earlier, Nigel, as well fairly bullish on 2022 just based on pipeline based on what we're seeing. I spend a lot of time with our customers understanding. And we get a question asked very frequently, is this typically a build and fill, build and fill. And what we're all seeing right now is a continued build and build responsibly. The fill rates are quite high. So it gives us great confidence that we would expect to have a really good 2022. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: Just to pick up a little bit more on price, I fully understand kind of the carryover impact you'd be expecting based on how you think you'll exit the year. Just wonder what the behavior is, though, if we get some deflation. Is it -- has it been your experience that you can hold pricing in a modest deflationary period of time? I would assume that price comes down at lag, so you probably get some benefit from there. But just wondering about kind of the overall stickiness and as they reach kind of the new higher level on pricing. \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. Good question, Jeff. It's Gary again. So I would say that just like you're right on the way up on the inflationary, it takes a couple of quarters. And if there's a deflationary environment, it would certainly take a couple of quarters to lag on the way down. But with that said, most of the actions we have implemented, we do believe are going to be pretty sticky. I mean there's a couple of onetime type things or things that probably aren't going to carry into 2022.\n But for the most part, the actions we are taking are really around list prices and multipliers and discounts. And those things in our environment tend to stick around more often than not. And the other reason we feel pretty good about that is just going back to what we were able to do in '19 and '20 with pricing, both in the $20 million-ish range. That should be sort of the lowest watermark as we think about anything in a normalized state. So overall, feel pretty good about where we sit for pricing as we go into '22. \nJeffrey Sprague: And then just on the fixed cost effort, the $30 million you've shown us here in the bridge, would this represent, I guess, maybe for a lack of a better phase, kind of an acceleration of what you were doing on this journey to get to 16%? Or is there some temporary actions here that have to [Technical Difficulty] way? Maybe you could just give us a little bit more context on the self-help levers that you're using, a, to try to combat inflation; and b, against the higher margin rate. \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. I think it's a combination of the 2, Jeff, meaning some is related to an acceleration of some of the cost actions that we planned at the beginning of the year. The others, it's hard to call them temporary because they're related to assumption with COVID opening up. So in our beginning of the year guidance, we anticipated that the world was going to open up in 2Q with travel and other discretionary costs, that's probably getting pushed out to the third or fourth quarter.\n So we're certainly going to benefit from lower discretionary costs there. But we've been able to accelerate some of the other fixed cost reductions. It's hard to quantify how much of that $30 million is going to carry over. If I were to pick a proportion, it's probably 50-50. There's probably 50% temporary, and there's probably 50% that is an acceleration of permanent things that we had in the hopper anyhow. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. What's the size of shipments you couldn't make in the second quarter due to the supply chain issues? Or said differently, what portion of that sequential growth you had in your backlog is due to supply chain issues? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. So I think very clearly, the costs are much easier to quantify than hypothetical lost sales. With that said, it certainly is greater than 0. The way I think is the best way to understand it is if you look at the second half of the year, what we have built into our guidance is probably somewhat conservative based on what we're anticipating as continued supply chain constraints. And that could amount to anywhere between 200 to 300 basis points of growth in the back half of the year that we believe could be constrained because of the availability of parts.\n So if you were to dollarize that, that's in the tens of millions of dollars. So it certainly isn't insignificant. I think we've gotten some feedback that there's a belief that our top line guide in the second half is somewhat conservative. And it could be built-in provision for what we think is a realistic scenario as it relates to being able to obtain parts. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And are you hearing that competitors are having sort of similar issues with -- in terms of on-time delivery and parts availability? \nRob Johnson: Yes. David, Rob Johnson here. Absolutely. And it's not just our equipment. It's across the board, whether it's steel, plastics for the construction of the building. It's really hit everybody. So I would say, in general, we're seeing lead times, for example, on things like generators and stuff that we don't sell, but go -- moving out. And it's happening pretty much to everybody. We're trying to all get after some of the same parts, whether it's fans or lithium-ion or discrete electrical components, yes, it's pretty much across the board for everyone. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then I know this might be a little tough to answer, but sort of what's the status quo price-cost benefit you would receive in 2022, if you just assume fourth quarter pricing actions hold for that year and material and freight cost hold for the year at sort of fourth quarter levels? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. I think a fairly rudimentary way to look at this. If you look at Slide 6, you see the pricing bars on the left and the material freight inflation on the right. Effectively, the white space above each of those quarterly bars would be the opportunity -- the upside opportunity from pricing. And the down potential detriment from material and freight inflation, predominantly the white space in that first quarter chart.\n So definitely, there's a tailwind from pricing. Don't necessarily want to quantify it for all the reasons we discussed. We're not 100% sure that it will all stick. The one thing that is clear from that chart is if -- what we're seeing in the Q4 for both price and inflation continues into next year, we certainly should see a net tailwind, part of it because of the overlap of timing, the cost certainly hit us sooner this year than the benefit of pricing. \nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: At risk of asking a stupid question, can you give us a sense of kind of the spot buys are most -- where you guys are most aggressive, what kind of bill of materials? \nRob Johnson: It's kind of a combination, certainly electronic components when we can get those. In the past, it's been things like IGBTs, certainly lithium-ion batteries have driven that and kind of a combination of areas around -- really focus there. Fans, I guess I would say, go into that category as well. So yes, that's -- and then there's -- included in some of the spot buys is, for example, the channel. We know that if we don't have the product, we lose the order, it goes to somebody else. So we've had to do some expediting and spot buys in there for certain components for our channel products, our single-phase UPSs, our rack-mount PDUs, those types of things. \nScott Davis: Yes, that makes sense. And in that context, when you think about some of the -- I mean, obviously, your main markets are fairly consolidated, but you do have some peripheral players here and there. I mean, I would think some of those guys might be suffering right now and perhaps lower down on the list of being able to get materials and things like that. Is there an opportunity right now on the M&A side to kind of participate in kind of another level of consolidation for some of the smaller suppliers around the peripheral, just that may be suffering a bit right now? Does that make sense? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. Scott, Gary. I think your logic flow is very just that logical. I would say that we're being pretty measured still in the M&A philosophy to say we want anything we do to go back to the 4 key tenets that we've talked about of why we'd want to acquire a company. There are some people that have reached out to us and said, this has been a difficult time, we want to partner with you. Yes, there's been a few more probably inbound calls.\n But I think from our standpoint, we really still stick to the 4 key strategic tenants of why we want to acquire a company. If one of those companies have to be struggling, great, certainly an opportunity there, but we're going to stay pretty true to the types of companies we want to buy, not just because they may be struggling in this environment. \nOperator: The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: I just wanted to ask my first one, a follow-up on Nigel's question earlier. So understanding that the majority of the pricing actions are benefiting the Americas, I assume, is that also the case for the inflation predominantly impacting Americas? And maybe as part of the answer to that question, if you want to give any color around what you're thinking for margin trajectory in the 3Q guidance, that would also be helpful. \nDavid Fallon: Got it. So Nicole, this is David. The one thing that we certainly have learned through the 2021 environment is that the supply chains are regional. So the impact of one region is certainly different than the impact in other regions. And we certainly can probably have a conversation on the drivers of that dynamic.\n But at the end of the day, what we're seeing is if you look at both the cost impact, inflation and spot buy and also the response for pricing, about 60% of what we're seeing is in the Americas. And the remainder fairly equally split between the other 2 regions. But just to understand the disproportionality there, Americas is about 45% of our company, but it's seen 60% of the impact of inflation. And of course, our pricing response there is stronger as well. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. And anything on just margins in the back half or in the third quarter by segment? Or is it just Americas probably looking the worst and then EMEA and APAC a little bit better on a year-on-year basis? \nDavid Fallon: That's certainly the case. The Americas -- depends if you look at it versus prior year versus your prior guidance, but the incremental cost that we included in the back half of the year are definitely proportionate to the Americas. If I'm remodeling, I would certainly model the Americas down. But with that said, for avoidance of doubt, the net inflation certainly impacts all 3 regions when you get down to the adjusted operating profit line item.\n The other 2 regions, notably EMEA, probably is relatively flat in part because some of the volume increase that we included in the guidance is probably disproportionate to EMEA as well. So that certainly helps from a fixed cost leverage. But all other things being equal, it certainly is disproportionate to the Americas. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And then I guess on mix, I mean, obviously, price cost is kind of overshadowing other impacts to margins right now. But is there anything on mix that we should be thinking about in the second half as maybe service ramps or other dynamics? \nDavid Fallon: No. We have a little bit of a mix dynamic for the full year related to higher growth in the critical infrastructure and solutions segments, and you can see that certainly on a year-to-date basis. We don't think there is anything significantly different that we'll see in the second half that we have not seen in the first half from a mix perspective.\n But certainly, the growth in that CI&S is expected to be a little bit higher than the 2 product segments. From a regional perspective, because the growth -- the sales growth we're seeing is in disproportionate to EMEA and EMEA's contribution margins are fairly close to the Americas, so we're not necessarily seeing a negative regional mix. So what we would see from a mix perspective certainly would be from a product perspective. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Just wondering if you could talk more about your expectation on supply chain costs and component availability going forward. And any outlook you may have as to when the cost pressures and supply tightness may begin to alleviate? Related to that, if cost does go up again in the fourth quarter, do you think your outlook that you can offset this cost inflation with pricing? Would that still hold to the extent pricing continued to go up in 4Q? \nRob Johnson: Thanks, Mark. I'll start off and then David, any comments there. But I would say, in general, we think things have leveled out as it relates to the cost. But again, it's always a supply and demand thing, and we'll continue to watch that. And if they continue to creep up, then we're going to have to crack prices up and continue to do that. So we use that lever to be fair to our customers, though, we're looking to cover our cost in this environment. \n As far as the easing of supply, it's going to be a combination of things that are happening. Certainly, chip fabs, we're in touch with some of the largest ones that we use to understand when they get additional capacity come on. And at the end of this year, there's some capacity and then towards the middle of 2022. \n So once that capacity comes online, we'll feel better about the overall components chip level anyway. We do know that whether it's fans or even lithium-ion, additional capacity is being brought online and gives us comfort in the future that we'll be able to see some of those constraints ease as well. That being said, our supply chain team has been very proactive in negotiating longer-term supply agreements, making commitments for supply longer than we normally would to be able to assure our supply as we get into 2022. \nMark Delaney: That's helpful. And for my second question, I was hoping to better understand the order growth of some of the components behind that. I believe the company said more than 20% order growth for 2 quarters in a row now. Maybe you could help break that down a little bit further in terms of how much is coming from growth and demand? How much is perhaps share gain? And then is there potentially a piece of this that is customers placing orders sooner than they normally would, given some of the global supply chain challenges? \nRob Johnson: Mark, this is Rob again. I'll start, and then Gary will come in over the top. A couple of things that we believe the dynamics are happening here. Our plan is working, and our plan was to gain share in the colo and hyperscale space and traditionally against probably local companies that you wouldn't be aware of in various parts of the region.\n We've been executing quite well there and seeing those orders flip in our direction. So part of our growth is just, hey, we're taking [indiscernible] some share in the smaller, more regional-based companies that you would recognize. I would say that, again, kind of similar thing in the channel. We've posted up some nice growth [indiscernible] channel with our various new innovative products finding that we need to take some share there as well, and we get data on that on a monthly basis on how we're doing. So we feel good about that. \n What we will see, I think, and saw a little bit of going forward is people wanting to get their slotting for 2022 to assure supply because everyone is experiencing the lack of supply customer wise. So I think we'll see an acceleration of people putting just like we have on our supply base, longer-term orders in place fixed and firm in order to be able to ensure that they can get their product when they need it. I don't know, any other thoughts, Gary? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. No, I think, Mark, I think, Rob nailed it spot on. And we definitely continue to see the [Audio Gap]. I would say that 20% of the first half growth, there's probably a pretty good chance that the market hasn't grown anywhere near that.\n And so I think with the latest updated guide even for the full year, we're at, what, close to 13%, 14% organic. And I think our best estimates right now is the market is probably growing maybe upper single digits, still a little fuzzy to tell exactly, but I think clearly, there's great momentum, not only there's good market -- there's good market demand right now. And there's also a really good penetration happening by our sales and marketing and product development teams.\n And Mark, one other thing to add there that I'm super excited about, David kind of mentioned that our investments are paying off in our VPDs. And an example of that is our -- one of our large cooling units that doesn't use water, innovative technology. In this area, we've been displacing other traditional technologies, maybe water cooled systems in that space.\n So we're seeing the investment in the R&D is ramping that and the products now coming out the door are truly innovative and allow for us to take share from that perspective. So we're very excited. Lot more to come there. I know we talked about it on the last call, some of those products, but I continue to be excited in both the channel for colo, hyperscale, even our enterprise customers and Edge customers, the stuff that we've got in the pipeline and the stuff that's already hit the ground that is really aiding us and getting above-market growth rate. \nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: I think -- I'm not sure if you guys have talked about it this way in the past, but what was your book-to-bill in the quarter? \nLynne Maxeiner: Yes. Sorry, I think we're having audio difficulties. Can you hear me okay, Steve? \nC. Stephen Tusa: Yes. Yes. \nLynne Maxeiner: Yes. Sorry about that. I think -- I'm not sure if some of the management are having an audio difficulties. But I think you're right, I mean book-to-bill is traditionally not a statistical ratio that we speak about externally. But I think if you look at just the order growth that we've seen over the past couple of quarters in excess of 20% which has been -- we've also posted really strong sales growth in those orders, too, but the momentum on orders has just been very strong, but the bill isn't something that we've externally. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just on kind of the second half commodity forecast. I mean you're kind of calling it flat year-over-year. I think there are other companies out there that are definitely calling for it to kind of step up in the back half a little bit more. Is there something about how you guys hedge these costs or your assumptions around price movements that would impact that? Or maybe you're just having different volume trends in these other guys where you grew better last year? \n I don't know. Is there any -- what's kind of the underlying assumption for that flat guidance for the second half on the commodes? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. It's based on what we're seeing in each of the regions. And as I mentioned, there's definitely regional differences. I would say we feel pretty good with where we're locked in as it relates in the forecast as it relates to APAC and EMEA the price increases from a steel perspective, as an example, certainly, were more pronounced in the Americas than the other 2 regions. \n So I would say if we do have uncertainty, it's related to what we're seeing in the Americas. With that said, I think what we have assumed in our forecast for Q3 and Q4 is actually slightly higher than what we're seeing currently. So even though it's below Q2, it's slightly lower than what we're seeing currently. \n And we've seen some stabilization in some of our input costs over the last 30 to 45 days. At the end of the day, we don't 100% know what's going to happen, but we believe we have enough of conservatism from a cost perspective built in. And the other dynamic to that is related to the spot buys. And as we mentioned, that's primarily related to electronic components, and we're certainly not unique in having that issue. That's a dynamic that we certainly believe can extend into 2022.\n But what we've included in the back half of the year is a combination of what we're seeing in market and also managed. So we certainly have an election whether to do a spot buy or not to do a spot buy, and we're making that decision based on a profitability algorithm, meaning we're not going to execute spot buys for every single order, but we certainly will prioritize those decisions based on what we're seeing on the demand side in the short run. \nOperator: The next question comes from Lance Vitanza with Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: On Slide 9, with respect to cash taxes and the inventory impact there, the inventory, $18 million of incremental inventory build over what I guess, what you did in 2Q '20, when should we expect to see the reversal of that back into cash flow as at some point you begin to work off the inventory build? And will we expect to see -- or should we expect to see additional inventory building before we get to that point? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks for the question. So if you look back at our historical cash flow generation from a quarterly perspective, we certainly have a pronounced uptick in the fourth quarter. Part of that is because of the higher volume that we see. And we generally build inventory during the year and then bleed it down in the fourth quarter.\n So I would say normally that dynamic happens in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned, the reason we did not take our free cash flow full year guidance up in the current guidance is a little bit because of the dynamic of what you're questioning. So it may make strategic sense for us to continue to build inventory, notably with electronic parts as it relates to adding some insurance heading into next year.\n So all other things being equal, the standard answer is generally, we would see that cash flow impact in the fourth quarter. This year, we're going to wait probably till sometime at the end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter to see if it makes sense to continue that inventory investment. \nLance Vitanza: Perfect. And then on the tax [ rate ], you mentioned that part of it is timing, part of it is just higher -- just the operating profit. Can you help us -- is it sort of 50-50 in terms of those 2 items? And how much would you say is [Technical Difficulty]? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. From a cash tax perspective, that's clearly related to timing last year. So our estimated cash tax payments in the second quarter of 2020 were probably artificially low based on our actual profits we were seeing on a year-to-date basis and also our expectations for the full year. So that's just the timing issue. I'll probably take this opportunity to maybe talk a little bit about the tax impact on the P&L.\n So we did take our full year income tax expense down about $10 million, $11 million for the full year. If you look at our tax expense, in Q2, we guided closer to 2021, and our expense was actually about $1 million. So that's a $20 million P&L benefit. That's not necessarily tied to this $20 million cash variance just for -- just for clarity there.\n But half of the $20 million P&L benefit was related to some legal entity restructuring we did in -- outside the U.S. That's a permanent benefit. The other $10 million was related to the ASC 740 accounting. So it's purely timing based. And a lot of that was unfortunately driven by the accounting we have to do for warrants, which pushed a lot of net $10 million expense in Q3 and probably more significantly in Q4. So probably more than what you're asking for from a tax perspective, but I thought there may be a question out there on that. \nLance Vitanza: Appreciate it. The last one [Technical Difficulty] 2.2x net leverage that you called out on the slide, I would imagine the gross leverage is closer to 3x. But could you just remind us like where should we think that leverage, whether it's [indiscernible] where do you think that's going to shape up a year from now, 2 years from now? And what other types of things should we be expecting you to use your cash from this $1 billion of liquidity that you have? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Lance. So you're right. On a gross basis, gross leverage is probably 3.3x, and we had about $700 million of cash on our balance sheet at the [indiscernible] that's what takes you down to the 2.2x, but we don't see that $700 million as burning a hole in our pocket So as we kind of mentioned, if you look at our priorities, we'll continue to pay down debt, but we certainly would like to use our balance sheet to look at some strategic acquisitions.\n And when we started this journey about 18 months ago, our net leverage was net 6 to 6.5x. We were 4x when we SPAC. And sitting at 2.2x feels a lot better. We have always talked about probably a comfortable long-term range is in that 2 to 3x. But with that said, we would certainly be comfortable getting above 3x for the right deal. And we also would feel comfortable getting below 2x if that right deal was not available.\n But from a prioritization perspective, we'll continue to pay down debt with certainly look at accretive strategic acquisitions. And if we're in a position we have to do something from a dividend perspective or a share repurchase perspective, we'll look at that when the time comes. \nOperator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: So you've mentioned that your pipeline and orders were continuing to improve in enterprise. Obviously, you didn't change any of your enterprise bubbles yet, but you did say that you could change them next quarter if current trends persist. So is it possible to quantify in some way what the recovery is looking like for you exiting Q2 in enterprise? And then ultimately, where have you seen the improved orders within enterprise? And what continuing trends are you looking at to turn enterprise from yellow to green? \nRob Johnson: Yes. So Andy, I'll start with that. And what I'd say is we began to see kind of in the June time frame that enterprise began to pick up by evidence of some of the channel movements, right, typically, refreshes as people go back to the office and network closets and things like that need to be picked up and refresh since they've been sitting there for a while.\n So that gives us some excitement about where it's going. We want to see that continue through Q3. And if we do, then you'll see that turn to green in terms of the buying, it is back. I would say, as we think about some of the hotter verticals right now in the enterprise area, it's certainly health care spending education spending some areas still kind of [indiscernible] as the travel. \n We certainly see financial institutions spending. So beginning we're post-COVID, but we've got this in-out thing still going on. We had talked about in previous calls that we have seen a lot of quote activity, a lot of engineering activity, and that is now being turned and placed into orders for us in the enterprise space. So I'm confident if it continues at the trajectory we saw in June that we'll be seeing a green there, and we'll be upwards in that enterprise space. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: And to be clear, you haven't seen any falloff in that trajectory with delta being around here, it's still been pretty good in July? \nRob Johnson: Yes, I would say without kind of going -- yes, we continue to see the trajectory and in the right direction for that enterprise business throughout July. Now again, it's early, lots of places are locking down with masks again. Again, we'll see what happens and what that does. But prior to all that, we are optimistic that we would be going green in Q3. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Great. And then it's great that you reiterate your medium-term adjusted operating margin target at 16% and reaching 20% I know you mentioned that the net tailwind from pricing in '22 happens. But does the current operating environment lead you to question at all the timing of the improvement? And then we know one of the main longer-term initiatives for Vertiv is to improve its pricing ability. So how would you assess your increased focus on dynamic pricing and how it's been working in the current environment? \nRob Johnson: I'll start off and then, David, you can chime in, or Gary. But obviously, we're getting more and more sophisticated with our ways we get price. We've talked about it in the past where we've instituted some AI and really pricing tools that allow our salespeople to understand when we lose at what price and when we win. We're expanding those tools as we've talked in the past, throughout Europe and then Asia.\n So this will continue to be a muscle that will flex and grow and get more and more mature and use more data analytics to drive it. So we continue to believe that pricing will be one of those levers that will continue to drive for years to come. But I feel good about where we're at. I feel good about the methodologies that we have and the ability to get that and really stemmed from a couple of years ago when we first started it, and we just continue to drive that. I don't know, David, any thoughts there? \nDavid Fallon: No, 100% agree, Rob. So I think what -- this year, it does not impact our plan to continue to increase adjusted operating margins in that 16% in the long term 20% range. And if anything, what we have seen this year has actually allowed us to develop some muscle from a pricing perspective. So that's always been a part of the equation to improve margins. And I think what we've seen this year gives us even more confidence that we can use that as a lever to -- on our path to 16% and then 20%. \nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess I have 2 questions as well. First up, I just wanted to understand, given the decision to ensure you have supply and product availability versus near-term profits, is that resulting in new customer acquisitions, new wins? Or are you really trying to satisfy your existing customers? And if figures around new customers then, should we think about you structurally beyond '21 being able to exploit the share gains, which I think you talked about 1.5x industry growth historically? \nRob Johnson: Yes. So I would say the -- first of all, thanks, Amit, for the question. This is Rob. I would say, absolutely, it's all customers, right, whether it's new or existing, we prioritize them as the orders come in and take care of them. And we've been very fair in our process. Certainly, with some of the new products that we've talked about the thermal management side and even some of the power management stuff and certainly channel, we feel like we have sustainable gain share there happening and we'll continue to see that momentum.\n And that's how part of our whole story is innovation and driving innovation and using that to take market share from a lot of the, what I call, more local companies. So we've globalized some of these products through our Vertiv Product Development process. And we see this being very sticky for us going into the next years. And it's, again, part of our strategy to grow faster than market. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess, David, when I look at your back half growth guide, you're implying 7% growth, 7.5% growth. Could you maybe contrast that with the full stack that's going to grow 24% and your backlog that's up 20% -- I guess, compares about, but why the decel in back half when your backlog is so strong? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I think there's 2 dynamics that are driving that. And companies often reference challenging comps. And at the end of the day, we target growth regardless of what the comps are. But we do because of the dynamics of what we saw with COVID in the first half of last year, notably in Q2. Some of those sales were pushed in the back half of the year. And notably the fourth quarter of last year, it creates a challenging comp. So that's number one.\n Number two is, as we mentioned, there's probably a little bit of cushion or buffer or conservatism, however you want to describe it, built into what we're seeing as it relates to our expectations of sales that we won't necessarily be able to deliver because of some of the supply chain constraints. And I think if you look at the -- from a quarterly perspective, I think it's 8% organic growth in Q3, 4% in Q4. We believe what we're guiding to is certainly is a very doable number, and we hope there's some upside. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks. \nRob Johnson: Okay. So all of you listening today and for your support, thank you again for the participation, the questions. As you can tell, I'm very excited about the demand for Vertiv products going forward for the rest of this year and well into 2022. So again, I appreciate the support, and this concludes the call for today. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Niederpruem",
            "content": "Yes. Nigel, Gary here. I think Rob hit the nail on the head. The only 2 other parts I'd add to your question are we do think most of the pricing that we're going to get right now is sticky. It's not going to be 100%, but the majority of that pricing should be sticky as we head into 2022. And as Rob mentioned in his opening comments, that should provide some tailwind for us throughout that next year.\n And then secondly, regional breakdown, I think the other part of your question was. There's a good chunk of this pricing, the majority of it that sits in Americas. So we're taking actions in all 3 regions. But just to your regional mix question, there certainly is a majority of the pricing that's going to happen in the Americas as well. Yes. Good question, Jeff. It's Gary again. So I would say that just like you're right on the way up on the inflationary, it takes a couple of quarters. And if there's a deflationary environment, it would certainly take a couple of quarters to lag on the way down. But with that said, most of the actions we have implemented, we do believe are going to be pretty sticky. I mean there's a couple of onetime type things or things that probably aren't going to carry into 2022.\n But for the most part, the actions we are taking are really around list prices and multipliers and discounts. And those things in our environment tend to stick around more often than not. And the other reason we feel pretty good about that is just going back to what we were able to do in '19 and '20 with pricing, both in the $20 million-ish range. That should be sort of the lowest watermark as we think about anything in a normalized state. So overall, feel pretty good about where we sit for pricing as we go into '22. Yes. I think it's a combination of the 2, Jeff, meaning some is related to an acceleration of some of the cost actions that we planned at the beginning of the year. The others, it's hard to call them temporary because they're related to assumption with COVID opening up. So in our beginning of the year guidance, we anticipated that the world was going to open up in 2Q with travel and other discretionary costs, that's probably getting pushed out to the third or fourth quarter.\n So we're certainly going to benefit from lower discretionary costs there. But we've been able to accelerate some of the other fixed cost reductions. It's hard to quantify how much of that $30 million is going to carry over. If I were to pick a proportion, it's probably 50-50. There's probably 50% temporary, and there's probably 50% that is an acceleration of permanent things that we had in the hopper anyhow. Yes. So I think very clearly, the costs are much easier to quantify than hypothetical lost sales. With that said, it certainly is greater than 0. The way I think is the best way to understand it is if you look at the second half of the year, what we have built into our guidance is probably somewhat conservative based on what we're anticipating as continued supply chain constraints. And that could amount to anywhere between 200 to 300 basis points of growth in the back half of the year that we believe could be constrained because of the availability of parts.\n So if you were to dollarize that, that's in the tens of millions of dollars. So it certainly isn't insignificant. I think we've gotten some feedback that there's a belief that our top line guide in the second half is somewhat conservative. And it could be built-in provision for what we think is a realistic scenario as it relates to being able to obtain parts. Yes. I think a fairly rudimentary way to look at this. If you look at Slide 6, you see the pricing bars on the left and the material freight inflation on the right. Effectively, the white space above each of those quarterly bars would be the opportunity -- the upside opportunity from pricing. And the down potential detriment from material and freight inflation, predominantly the white space in that first quarter chart.\n So definitely, there's a tailwind from pricing. Don't necessarily want to quantify it for all the reasons we discussed. We're not 100% sure that it will all stick. The one thing that is clear from that chart is if -- what we're seeing in the Q4 for both price and inflation continues into next year, we certainly should see a net tailwind, part of it because of the overlap of timing, the cost certainly hit us sooner this year than the benefit of pricing. Yes. Scott, Gary. I think your logic flow is very just that logical. I would say that we're being pretty measured still in the M&A philosophy to say we want anything we do to go back to the 4 key tenets that we've talked about of why we'd want to acquire a company. There are some people that have reached out to us and said, this has been a difficult time, we want to partner with you. Yes, there's been a few more probably inbound calls.\n But I think from our standpoint, we really still stick to the 4 key strategic tenants of why we want to acquire a company. If one of those companies have to be struggling, great, certainly an opportunity there, but we're going to stay pretty true to the types of companies we want to buy, not just because they may be struggling in this environment. Yes. No, I think, Mark, I think, Rob nailed it spot on. And we definitely continue to see the [Audio Gap]. I would say that 20% of the first half growth, there's probably a pretty good chance that the market hasn't grown anywhere near that.\n And so I think with the latest updated guide even for the full year, we're at, what, close to 13%, 14% organic. And I think our best estimates right now is the market is probably growing maybe upper single digits, still a little fuzzy to tell exactly, but I think clearly, there's great momentum, not only there's good market -- there's good market demand right now. And there's also a really good penetration happening by our sales and marketing and product development teams.\n And Mark, one other thing to add there that I'm super excited about, David kind of mentioned that our investments are paying off in our VPDs. And an example of that is our -- one of our large cooling units that doesn't use water, innovative technology. In this area, we've been displacing other traditional technologies, maybe water cooled systems in that space.\n So we're seeing the investment in the R&D is ramping that and the products now coming out the door are truly innovative and allow for us to take share from that perspective. So we're very excited. Lot more to come there. I know we talked about it on the last call, some of those products, but I continue to be excited in both the channel for colo, hyperscale, even our enterprise customers and Edge customers, the stuff that we've got in the pipeline and the stuff that's already hit the ground that is really aiding us and getting above-market growth rate."

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results versus last year. Net sales were up $254 million or 25% and 20% when adjusted for a $50 million foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with second quarter orders, as Rob mentioned, which were up 24% after increasing over 20% in the first quarter.\n Adjusted operating profit increased $31 million or 30%, primarily driven by the profit flow-through from higher sales. However, as discussed, our contribution margin in the second quarter was negatively influenced by material and freight inflation, which impacted our second quarter P&L in advance of much of the favorable pricing expected to materially benefit the second half of the year. The negative impact of net inflation on contribution margin in the second quarter was approximately $25 million with another $10 million impacting contribution margin driven by the plant inefficiencies driven by the supply chain environment.\n Fixed costs were up $20 million from last year's second quarter, including $30 million from last year's onetime COVID cost actions and $20 million from incremental growth in ER&D investments, both partially offset by continued fixed cost reduction initiatives and an impairment of capitalized software recognized in last year's second quarter.\n Our adjusted earnings per share increased $0.15 to $0.31, primarily on the strength of higher adjusted operating profit and lower interest and income tax expense. Free cash flow was down $20 million from last year's second quarter. But as we discussed in our first quarter conference call, free cash flow in the first quarter was positively impacted by $25 million due to the delay of the cash disbursement at the end of the first quarter as a result of the systems implementation. And of course, this timing also negatively impacted second quarter free cash flow by the same $25 million. Otherwise, free cash flow would have been in line with last year's second quarter.\n Turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $80 million or 16.5%, driven by strong double-digit growth across all 3 product segments. Net sales in APAC were up $75 million or 23%, with growth across most of the APAC subregions, product segments and market verticals.\n Net sales in EMEA were up $99 million or an impressive 50%, 41% organic, predominantly in the critical infrastructure and solutions products segment driven by several larger colocation projects. From a profitability perspective, adjusted operating margin declined in both the Americas and APAC, with both regions negatively impacted by material and freight inflation with Americas disproportionately impacted due to regional differences in commodity markets and higher electronic spot buys to support a larger channel business.\n Adjusted operating profit improved in EMEA despite inflation challenges due to the leverage benefit of lower fixed costs on a significantly higher net sales base. Once again, this demonstrates the margin benefit of maintaining or reducing fixed costs while growing the top line. You may have heard the philosophy of keeping fixed cost constant. So this is once again, a real applicable example of that.\n Next turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges second quarter free cash flow from last year. The year-over-year benefit from higher adjusted operating profit and lower cash interest payments was more than offset by several unfavorable variances including $20 million in cash taxes driven by lower estimated payments in last year's second quarter, primarily due to COVID uncertainty.\n And we also had an additional $18 million outflow from inventory as we have proactively invested in inventory to satisfy customer demand in this challenging supply chain environment. Despite the unfavorable quarterly year-over-year comparison, year-to-date free cash flow is still $225 million higher than the same period last year. Last on this slide, we ended the second quarter with a record high liquidity of $1.1 billion and a record low net leverage -- net debt leverage ratio of 2.2x.\n Next turning to Slide 10. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial guidance. We expect first half top line momentum to continue into the third quarter, with net sales up 10% at the midpoint, including a double-digit growth in EMEA and upper single-digit growth in Americas and APAC. So we expect the growth momentum to continue to cross all 3 regions.\n This sales guidance assumes $25 million year-over-year benefit from pricing. And that's probably a little bit more proportionately directed at the Americas versus the other 2 regions. We guide towards adjusted operating profit of $160 million at the midpoint, up $92 million from last year. But as a reminder, we recognized an $80 million combined charge in last year's third quarter for restructuring and an asset impairment. This adjusted operating profit guidance assumes that the third quarter benefit from pricing does not quite offset the negative impact from inflation. However, we do anticipate a full offset pricing versus inflation in the fourth quarter.\n Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to increase approximately $0.23 at the midpoint, primarily driven by the $8 million restructuring and asset impairment charge in last year's third quarter as the EPS benefits from incremental volume are offset by headwinds from net price inflation and last year's COVID actions, which were still $10 million in the third quarter of 2020.\n Next turning to Slide 11. We summarize our revised full year 2021 financial guidance, including net sales of $5 billion, up 14% from 2020 and $100 million higher than our prior guidance. We are increasing our adjusted operating profit guidance to $600 million, up $5 million from prior guidance. And we will provide some detail of dollar increase on the next slide. We are taking down our full year estimate for adjusted operating margin by approximately 10 basis points at the midpoint. There are several moving pieces to our updated operating profit guidance, which certainly impact operating margin.\n Some of these are favorable; some are unfavorable as illustrated on the next slide. But in the macro, the reduction is driven by the additional net inflation and related costs, offset by fixed cost actions we have initiated, including controlling discretionary spending.\n For the avoidance of any doubt, we are reaffirming our adjusted operating margin targets of 16% in the intermediate term and 20% in the long term. We believe the net inflation headwind is an unfortunate 2021 dynamic due to constrained supply chains coming out of COVID. And we believe the pricing actions we are implementing today will generate a nice tailwind for 2022. And we are certainly incurring costs today to satisfy customer needs currently, and I'm referring to the spot buys and expedited freight, that we consider a long-term investment in our customer relationships, which can be referenced as winning later.\n Even though it is hypothetical, at least on paper without the $45 million net inflation headwinds, we could be discussing adjusted operating profit in the $645 million range for 2020 as growth remains robust, with net sales now expected to be $225 million at the midpoint higher than our beginning-of-the-year estimates.\n Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.15, $0.04 higher than our prior full year guidance, driven by the $5 million increase in adjusted operating profit, about $0.01, and $11 million lower full year tax expense contributing about $0.03. And that was primarily the result of a discrete tax benefit that we recognized in the second quarter.\n Finally, we are maintaining our full year projected free cash flow guidance of $300 million, which is up almost $140 million from full year 2020. We discussed internally whether we should increase our full year free cash flow guidance, but we are holding flat due to uncertainty in the supply chain, we generally realize a really nice cash inflow in the fourth quarter from the reduction of inventory, but we want to wait another quarter to see how that plays out for this year. With that said, we do like the upper end of the range of our $290 million to $310 million free cash flow full year guidance.\n Next, turning to Slide 12. This chart bridges our full year adjusted operating profit from prior guidance of $5 million increase. On the prior slide, we noted a $100 million net sales increase. The components of this increase include $40 million of pricing mostly in the second half, $15 million of foreign exchange translation almost entirely in the second quarter and $45 million of volume with $35 million of that in the second quarter and $10 million in the second half. The $40 million of pricing is depicted in the first green bar.\n The second green bar reflects the benefits of various fixed cost reduction actions we implemented in the second quarter, including controlling discretionary spending, and this should benefit the remainder of 2021. The third green bar reflects the expected flow-through from the $40 million to $45 million incremental organic volume.\n The 2 largest red bars on this page reflect our updated views on the impact of supply chain challenges in 2021. This represents combined about $65 million of higher cost compared to our previous guidance with an incremental $20 million realized in the second quarter and $45 million added to the second half. Finally, on this slide, the last red bar on the right reflects expected headwinds from our prior guidance related to timing delays in productivity, both in purchasing and in the plant as a result of the current supply chain environment.\n With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Rob? Got it. So Nicole, this is David. The one thing that we certainly have learned through the 2021 environment is that the supply chains are regional. So the impact of one region is certainly different than the impact in other regions. And we certainly can probably have a conversation on the drivers of that dynamic.\n But at the end of the day, what we're seeing is if you look at both the cost impact, inflation and spot buy and also the response for pricing, about 60% of what we're seeing is in the Americas. And the remainder fairly equally split between the other 2 regions. But just to understand the disproportionality there, Americas is about 45% of our company, but it's seen 60% of the impact of inflation. And of course, our pricing response there is stronger as well. That's certainly the case. The Americas -- depends if you look at it versus prior year versus your prior guidance, but the incremental cost that we included in the back half of the year are definitely proportionate to the Americas. If I'm remodeling, I would certainly model the Americas down. But with that said, for avoidance of doubt, the net inflation certainly impacts all 3 regions when you get down to the adjusted operating profit line item.\n The other 2 regions, notably EMEA, probably is relatively flat in part because some of the volume increase that we included in the guidance is probably disproportionate to EMEA as well. So that certainly helps from a fixed cost leverage. But all other things being equal, it certainly is disproportionate to the Americas. No. We have a little bit of a mix dynamic for the full year related to higher growth in the critical infrastructure and solutions segments, and you can see that certainly on a year-to-date basis. We don't think there is anything significantly different that we'll see in the second half that we have not seen in the first half from a mix perspective.\n But certainly, the growth in that CI&S is expected to be a little bit higher than the 2 product segments. From a regional perspective, because the growth -- the sales growth we're seeing is in disproportionate to EMEA and EMEA's contribution margins are fairly close to the Americas, so we're not necessarily seeing a negative regional mix. So what we would see from a mix perspective certainly would be from a product perspective. Yes. It's based on what we're seeing in each of the regions. And as I mentioned, there's definitely regional differences. I would say we feel pretty good with where we're locked in as it relates in the forecast as it relates to APAC and EMEA the price increases from a steel perspective, as an example, certainly, were more pronounced in the Americas than the other 2 regions. \n So I would say if we do have uncertainty, it's related to what we're seeing in the Americas. With that said, I think what we have assumed in our forecast for Q3 and Q4 is actually slightly higher than what we're seeing currently. So even though it's below Q2, it's slightly lower than what we're seeing currently. \n And we've seen some stabilization in some of our input costs over the last 30 to 45 days. At the end of the day, we don't 100% know what's going to happen, but we believe we have enough of conservatism from a cost perspective built in. And the other dynamic to that is related to the spot buys. And as we mentioned, that's primarily related to electronic components, and we're certainly not unique in having that issue. That's a dynamic that we certainly believe can extend into 2022.\n But what we've included in the back half of the year is a combination of what we're seeing in market and also managed. So we certainly have an election whether to do a spot buy or not to do a spot buy, and we're making that decision based on a profitability algorithm, meaning we're not going to execute spot buys for every single order, but we certainly will prioritize those decisions based on what we're seeing on the demand side in the short run. Yes. Thanks for the question. So if you look back at our historical cash flow generation from a quarterly perspective, we certainly have a pronounced uptick in the fourth quarter. Part of that is because of the higher volume that we see. And we generally build inventory during the year and then bleed it down in the fourth quarter.\n So I would say normally that dynamic happens in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned, the reason we did not take our free cash flow full year guidance up in the current guidance is a little bit because of the dynamic of what you're questioning. So it may make strategic sense for us to continue to build inventory, notably with electronic parts as it relates to adding some insurance heading into next year.\n So all other things being equal, the standard answer is generally, we would see that cash flow impact in the fourth quarter. This year, we're going to wait probably till sometime at the end of the third quarter, early fourth quarter to see if it makes sense to continue that inventory investment. Yes. From a cash tax perspective, that's clearly related to timing last year. So our estimated cash tax payments in the second quarter of 2020 were probably artificially low based on our actual profits we were seeing on a year-to-date basis and also our expectations for the full year. So that's just the timing issue. I'll probably take this opportunity to maybe talk a little bit about the tax impact on the P&L.\n So we did take our full year income tax expense down about $10 million, $11 million for the full year. If you look at our tax expense, in Q2, we guided closer to 2021, and our expense was actually about $1 million. So that's a $20 million P&L benefit. That's not necessarily tied to this $20 million cash variance just for -- just for clarity there.\n But half of the $20 million P&L benefit was related to some legal entity restructuring we did in -- outside the U.S. That's a permanent benefit. The other $10 million was related to the ASC 740 accounting. So it's purely timing based. And a lot of that was unfortunately driven by the accounting we have to do for warrants, which pushed a lot of net $10 million expense in Q3 and probably more significantly in Q4. So probably more than what you're asking for from a tax perspective, but I thought there may be a question out there on that. Yes. Thanks, Lance. So you're right. On a gross basis, gross leverage is probably 3.3x, and we had about $700 million of cash on our balance sheet at the [indiscernible] that's what takes you down to the 2.2x, but we don't see that $700 million as burning a hole in our pocket So as we kind of mentioned, if you look at our priorities, we'll continue to pay down debt, but we certainly would like to use our balance sheet to look at some strategic acquisitions.\n And when we started this journey about 18 months ago, our net leverage was net 6 to 6.5x. We were 4x when we SPAC. And sitting at 2.2x feels a lot better. We have always talked about probably a comfortable long-term range is in that 2 to 3x. But with that said, we would certainly be comfortable getting above 3x for the right deal. And we also would feel comfortable getting below 2x if that right deal was not available.\n But from a prioritization perspective, we'll continue to pay down debt with certainly look at accretive strategic acquisitions. And if we're in a position we have to do something from a dividend perspective or a share repurchase perspective, we'll look at that when the time comes. No, 100% agree, Rob. So I think what -- this year, it does not impact our plan to continue to increase adjusted operating margins in that 16% in the long term 20% range. And if anything, what we have seen this year has actually allowed us to develop some muscle from a pricing perspective. So that's always been a part of the equation to improve margins. And I think what we've seen this year gives us even more confidence that we can use that as a lever to -- on our path to 16% and then 20%. Yes. I think there's 2 dynamics that are driving that. And companies often reference challenging comps. And at the end of the day, we target growth regardless of what the comps are. But we do because of the dynamics of what we saw with COVID in the first half of last year, notably in Q2. Some of those sales were pushed in the back half of the year. And notably the fourth quarter of last year, it creates a challenging comp. So that's number one.\n Number two is, as we mentioned, there's probably a little bit of cushion or buffer or conservatism, however you want to describe it, built into what we're seeing as it relates to our expectations of sales that we won't necessarily be able to deliver because of some of the supply chain constraints. And I think if you look at the -- from a quarterly perspective, I think it's 8% organic growth in Q3, 4% in Q4. We believe what we're guiding to is certainly is a very doable number, and we hope there's some upside."

            "name": "Rob Johnson",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and thanks for your guidance that you provide both to me and to my executive team in supporting Vertiv in all the ways that you do. We are better and a stronger company having you as our Executive Chairman. To all of you on today's call, thank you for being here. And I'm eager to share with you our performance for the 2021 second quarter, our outlook on the market and information about a few of our growth initiatives that we're driving at Vertiv.\n There are 5 key messages I want to convey today. And David Fallon, our CFO, will take you into a deeper dive of the financials in just a few minutes. First of all, demand for Vertiv products and services is strong. During our last earnings call, we reported first quarter sales that were up more than 22% and orders that were up 21% compared to the first quarter of last year.\n I am pleased to report that the sales and orders are up again in Q2. Sales were up 25% and orders were up over 24%. Having sales and orders growth in excess of 20% in the back-to-back quarters demonstrates our customer-first approach and that it is paying off. In addition, our Q2 backlog rose to $2.3 billion, the highest it's ever been.\n Second, profitability is up. This quarter, our adjusted operating profit was $134 million, which is up $31 million or 30% from last year's second quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Third, Year-to-date free cash flow is greater today than it was this time last year. Free cash flow for Q2 was $41 million and year-to-date, $84 million. From a year-to-date perspective, this represents an improvement of over $225 million versus the first half of 2020.\n Fourth, we are dealing with supply chain issues and inflation issues. We encountered supply chain challenges in Q2 and experienced commodity and freight inflation. As Dave mentioned, we made spot buys so that we can meet the delivery commitments to serve our customers and we've implemented strategies to recapture cost. Pricing always lags cost by a quarter or 2, and that's exactly what we're seeing now. I have a slide coming up with more details on this.\n And finally, the key message, we're raising our 2021 guidance by $100 million in sales and $5 million in adjusted operating profit. This action demonstrates the confidence we have in our end markets and also reflects the priority we're placing on customer pursuit and capture. In addition, we are balancing the timing of incremental pricing coming into the P&L.\n Turning to Page 4. We've been using this slide each quarter to illustrate what we are seeing in each of our world regions and each of our end markets. As we said before, Red button indicates sluggish performance. The green button indicates strong performance, and the yellow button indicates somewhere in between. For the second quarter in a row, there are no reds.\n Let's take each market. Cloud and hyperscale and our colocation markets remain strong. The demand for digital applications continue to fuel the industry and is driving strong and a growing need for Vertiv products and services. In our enterprise small and medium business market, we continue to see signs of progress as it works to recover from the pandemic. We are experiencing an increase in pipeline and orders. If the current pace of activity continues in this upward trajectory, we will be able to upgrade a few of the markets that are yellow to green on our next call.\n The communication network stayed constant in all regions. 5G deployments and trials are continuing as are the starts and stops of customer deployments. These will provide tailwinds for us over the next few years. In the commercial and industrial market, things remain constant. While this is the smallest slice of our business, the variety of products and services we sell here continues to strengthen. All in all, the end markets we serve have remained steady.\n Moving on to Slide 5. I want to provide a little bit of color around demand as we're seeing it and give you a glimpse of 2 of growth investments. As mentioned earlier, overall market demand is strong, as indicated by our order rates and record backlog. This scenario led us to raise our guidance.\n Each of our regions saw revenue growth in the second quarter, led by continued strength in the cloud and colocation markets. Our cloud and colocation customers continue to build data centers in an aggressive but balanced fashion, and we continue to partner with them to meet the strong and growing demand. We are receiving every opportunity to capture long-term customer commitments and investing in spot buys, as Dave mentioned, to procure essential product components to take care of the delivery for our customers.\n Moving to the column on the right and to our growth investments. I want to talk about 2 specific investments. First, our IT channel business; and second, our Vertiv Product Development initiative. For the channel, our channel is growing and is part of our strategy and our growth strategy for our business. We have spent time in listening to our partners.\n We fine-tuned our strategy. We've built a new partner portal, developed augmented reality sales tools, added configurators, increased sales support and ramped up our digital presence in a quest to make Vertiv easy for our partners to do business with. These efforts are definitely paying dividends. Existing partnerships are being strengthened. New partnerships are being formed, and all partners are promoting Vertiv. By the numbers, we had a 50% increase in the number of resellers that are actively buying our products since this time last year. Customer base is up over 400% from Q2 of last year.\n A second example of how one of our growth initiatives is performing can be illustrated with this customer success story. Green Mountain is a European colocation provider. Green Mountain recently selected Vertiv as a supplier for our, as they call it, our cutting-edge technology. A key executive from Green Mountain has gone on to say the sustainability of the product and the suppliers is a key factor when purchasing new equipment. Vertiv technologies are the most efficient I've seen, and this will further improve our overall sustainability.\n The investments we are making in our Vertiv Product Development growth initiatives are helping us develop more cutting-edge and energy efficiency technologies for innovation, sustainability and expanding our list of customers. These are just 2 examples that demonstrate the progress we are making as we drive focus, resources on growth and investment areas.\n Moving on to Slide 6. Well, pricing is never easy task, but this market has required it. We are estimating having $65 million of pricing actions for the full year versus 2020. As you can see, though, by the time we get to Q4, we will have pricing that fully offset inflationary costs.\n Moving to the second column. Inflation is being felt by us in material, freight cost and spot buys. Approximately $60 million in materials, $15 million in freight and $35 million in spot buys. We expect the cost impacts to ramp down in 2022 driving net tailwinds. David will provide additional commentary.\n The third column depicts how we expect our contribution margin to evolve over the next 2 quarters. The timing of pricing versus inflation causing a dip in Q2. The pricing actions will accelerate in Q3, driving margin recovery. We anticipate full recovery by Q4 as headwinds stabilize and the pricing plan is fully implemented. And as mentioned, we're expecting a net tailwind in 2022 for this activity. So while we've experienced some short-term cost impacts, pricing is coming and customer investments we are making in are in the short term and will, over the long term, continue to drive shareholder value.\n With that, I'll turn it over to David for a closer look at our Q2 numbers, and we'll come back at the end with some final comments. David? Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 13, which is our last slide, recap the key messages for the quarter. As I close, I want you to know how proud I am with the Vertiv team and what we're doing together as a one Vertiv company. We've accomplished a great first half of the year. The results we've shared today reflect the hard work and commitment of the 20,000 employees, some in the factories, some in the field and some in the offices and some still working remotely in over 130 countries around the world.\n As I look at the remaining months of 2021 and as we continue to invest strategically, I'm confident that we'll see above-market top line growth and increase in profitability and a strengthening balance sheet. When I look down the road at 2022 and beyond, my confidence is bolstered by the conversations that I've had personally with partners and key customers about the demand, pricing and pipeline.\n To all employees, I'm grateful for the part you've played in the past 3 months and have allowed me to provide today's earnings report. Thank you for your dedication and your tireless effort to take care of our customers. To our investors, thank you for being on the call today and for your trust and support in Vertiv. It is truly my pleasure to be leading Vertiv.\n I will now turn the call over to the operator who will open up the line for questions. Okay. Nigel, thanks for your question. This is Rob. I'll start off and then let Gary and David weigh in. Pricing actions were actually underway at the beginning of Q2 as we begin to see this inflationary environment. As you know, we feed a lot off of our backlog. And some of those things in our backlog, we can look at price, we can look at freight. But for the most part, as we've indicated on the call, you'll see that really kind of come to life in Q3 and Q4. So we know orders that we got in Q2 that we'll ship in Q3, Q4, Q1, we know we got price on those. So that's why we feel confident that we will get the price and we are getting the price. So that's the first thing.\n The same thing we've done which has been talked about widely with industrials is the ability to get price in the channel and distribution. That's a much faster lever from that perspective. But for us, as a company compared to other industrials, we're a smaller player in that, but that's an area that we're growing fast.\n So we have taken pricing actions in some cases, 3 times within that space that will -- we've seen stick, and we've seen our order growth rates, as you can see in our channels beginning to grow at the pace that we've talked about in the past. We expect to continue to take share in that space while we continue to raise price and drive that. I don't know, any other comments, Gary or David? I think we see that as well as we see continued -- the pricing that we're getting now for stuff that's going to be rolling out in 2022. And my comments earlier, Nigel, as well fairly bullish on 2022 just based on pipeline based on what we're seeing. I spend a lot of time with our customers understanding. And we get a question asked very frequently, is this typically a build and fill, build and fill. And what we're all seeing right now is a continued build and build responsibly. The fill rates are quite high. So it gives us great confidence that we would expect to have a really good 2022. Yes. David, Rob Johnson here. Absolutely. And it's not just our equipment. It's across the board, whether it's steel, plastics for the construction of the building. It's really hit everybody. So I would say, in general, we're seeing lead times, for example, on things like generators and stuff that we don't sell, but go -- moving out. And it's happening pretty much to everybody. We're trying to all get after some of the same parts, whether it's fans or lithium-ion or discrete electrical components, yes, it's pretty much across the board for everyone. It's kind of a combination, certainly electronic components when we can get those. In the past, it's been things like IGBTs, certainly lithium-ion batteries have driven that and kind of a combination of areas around -- really focus there. Fans, I guess I would say, go into that category as well. So yes, that's -- and then there's -- included in some of the spot buys is, for example, the channel. We know that if we don't have the product, we lose the order, it goes to somebody else. So we've had to do some expediting and spot buys in there for certain components for our channel products, our single-phase UPSs, our rack-mount PDUs, those types of things. Thanks, Mark. I'll start off and then David, any comments there. But I would say, in general, we think things have leveled out as it relates to the cost. But again, it's always a supply and demand thing, and we'll continue to watch that. And if they continue to creep up, then we're going to have to crack prices up and continue to do that. So we use that lever to be fair to our customers, though, we're looking to cover our cost in this environment. \n As far as the easing of supply, it's going to be a combination of things that are happening. Certainly, chip fabs, we're in touch with some of the largest ones that we use to understand when they get additional capacity come on. And at the end of this year, there's some capacity and then towards the middle of 2022. \n So once that capacity comes online, we'll feel better about the overall components chip level anyway. We do know that whether it's fans or even lithium-ion, additional capacity is being brought online and gives us comfort in the future that we'll be able to see some of those constraints ease as well. That being said, our supply chain team has been very proactive in negotiating longer-term supply agreements, making commitments for supply longer than we normally would to be able to assure our supply as we get into 2022. Mark, this is Rob again. I'll start, and then Gary will come in over the top. A couple of things that we believe the dynamics are happening here. Our plan is working, and our plan was to gain share in the colo and hyperscale space and traditionally against probably local companies that you wouldn't be aware of in various parts of the region.\n We've been executing quite well there and seeing those orders flip in our direction. So part of our growth is just, hey, we're taking [indiscernible] some share in the smaller, more regional-based companies that you would recognize. I would say that, again, kind of similar thing in the channel. We've posted up some nice growth [indiscernible] channel with our various new innovative products finding that we need to take some share there as well, and we get data on that on a monthly basis on how we're doing. So we feel good about that. \n What we will see, I think, and saw a little bit of going forward is people wanting to get their slotting for 2022 to assure supply because everyone is experiencing the lack of supply customer wise. So I think we'll see an acceleration of people putting just like we have on our supply base, longer-term orders in place fixed and firm in order to be able to ensure that they can get their product when they need it. I don't know, any other thoughts, Gary? Yes. So Andy, I'll start with that. And what I'd say is we began to see kind of in the June time frame that enterprise began to pick up by evidence of some of the channel movements, right, typically, refreshes as people go back to the office and network closets and things like that need to be picked up and refresh since they've been sitting there for a while.\n So that gives us some excitement about where it's going. We want to see that continue through Q3. And if we do, then you'll see that turn to green in terms of the buying, it is back. I would say, as we think about some of the hotter verticals right now in the enterprise area, it's certainly health care spending education spending some areas still kind of [indiscernible] as the travel. \n We certainly see financial institutions spending. So beginning we're post-COVID, but we've got this in-out thing still going on. We had talked about in previous calls that we have seen a lot of quote activity, a lot of engineering activity, and that is now being turned and placed into orders for us in the enterprise space. So I'm confident if it continues at the trajectory we saw in June that we'll be seeing a green there, and we'll be upwards in that enterprise space. Yes, I would say without kind of going -- yes, we continue to see the trajectory and in the right direction for that enterprise business throughout July. Now again, it's early, lots of places are locking down with masks again. Again, we'll see what happens and what that does. But prior to all that, we are optimistic that we would be going green in Q3. I'll start off and then, David, you can chime in, or Gary. But obviously, we're getting more and more sophisticated with our ways we get price. We've talked about it in the past where we've instituted some AI and really pricing tools that allow our salespeople to understand when we lose at what price and when we win. We're expanding those tools as we've talked in the past, throughout Europe and then Asia.\n So this will continue to be a muscle that will flex and grow and get more and more mature and use more data analytics to drive it. So we continue to believe that pricing will be one of those levers that will continue to drive for years to come. But I feel good about where we're at. I feel good about the methodologies that we have and the ability to get that and really stemmed from a couple of years ago when we first started it, and we just continue to drive that. I don't know, David, any thoughts there? Yes. So I would say the -- first of all, thanks, Amit, for the question. This is Rob. I would say, absolutely, it's all customers, right, whether it's new or existing, we prioritize them as the orders come in and take care of them. And we've been very fair in our process. Certainly, with some of the new products that we've talked about the thermal management side and even some of the power management stuff and certainly channel, we feel like we have sustainable gain share there happening and we'll continue to see that momentum.\n And that's how part of our whole story is innovation and driving innovation and using that to take market share from a lot of the, what I call, more local companies. So we've globalized some of these products through our Vertiv Product Development process. And we see this being very sticky for us going into the next years. And it's, again, part of our strategy to grow faster than market. Okay. So all of you listening today and for your support, thank you again for the participation, the questions. As you can tell, I'm very excited about the demand for Vertiv products going forward for the rest of this year and well into 2022. So again, I appreciate the support, and this concludes the call for today."

Vertiv is a great company and is in a really good industry. No company, no industry is ever perfect, of course, but from what I've seen over the last 8 years, I am very pleased with the company, the management team and the industry.\n Vertiv continues to make all of the right investments in product development in the Vertiv User Experience, in the Vertiv Operating System and many more arenas, which are all areas that will pay off more in the future than they even have to date. Truly is personifying the winning now winning later mantra that you all know is so important to me.\n The focus on today and tomorrow at the same time is especially true as Rob and his team focus on taking care of customers. It's an age old concept, but it sure has been proven to be true. And if you do a great job of taking care of customers, that is one of the best long-term strategies you can have.\n So it is costing us something to do, as you can see from the numbers, with those [ flat back eyes ] that Rob and his team have had to do to. But all of us are absolutely convinced it's the right thing to do. Taking care of customers today and tomorrow every way you can is clearly a winning strategy.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thanks, Grant, and good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, David Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem. \n Before we begin, I point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in this earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our registration statement, our proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. \n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings presentation and press release, also the investor slide deck found on our website at investor \n [Audio Gap] \n .com. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, David Cote. \nDavid Cote: Thanks, Lynne. This is now the fifth quarter we've reported as a public company, and I think you can see what I've seen and talked about this entire time. This really is a great company in a really good industry with multiple ways to continue improving the top and bottom line. \n Rob and his team, as you can see, are making great progress with new products, global growth and the process initiatives like the Vertiv operating system, Vertiv product development, customer view and functional transformation. And these process initiatives show that there are lots of barriers to improve upon, and Rob and the team are focused on those. But I think you'll also agree with me that the first quarter results sure are something to be proud of and provide us a great start to the year. \n So with that, I'll turn it over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thanks, Dave. Thank you for your guidance that you provide to me and the executive team and the support for Vertiv that you always have given. We really appreciate it. \n To all of you on today's call, thank you for being here, and I'm eager to share more about our performance for the first quarter, our outlook for the market and give you a glimpse of a few new products Dave just talked about that our talented and innovative teams at Vertiv have developed. \n Turning to Slide 3. There are 5 key messages I want to convey today, and we'll share them at a high level, and David will elaborate more on the financial details in just a few minutes. First, I'm pleased to report sales were up more than 22%, and orders were up 21% versus Q1 of 2020. Growth happened in all regions across all major verticals, and we ended the quarter with a record high backlog of $2.1 billion. \n Second, from a profitability standpoint, our adjusted operating profit was $112 million, which is up $92 million or 450% from last year's first quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of over 790 basis points, driven by higher sales and lower fixed cost on a percentage basis. \n Third, our free cash flow at the end of Q1 was $43 million, an improvement of $246 million, made possible by higher earnings and lower interest expense. \n Fourth, the market is facing supply chain and commodity cost challenges, and Vertiv is not exempt. We are aggressively working to secure supply needed so that we can provide on-time delivery to our customers, first and foremost, while developing and executing strategies to share the cost with our customers where possible. Because supply chain constraints, coupled with inflation, we will see some incremental unexpected costs over the short term. \n And fifth, and the final key message, we are raising our 2021 sales guidance by $125 million, such that the new sales guidance is between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion. And raising our adjusted operating profit guidance by $20 million. So our operating guidance is now $585 million to $605 million. \n This demonstrates our confidence in the end markets and the confidence in our teams all across Vertiv to perform in accordance with our strategy and to meet the growing needs of our customers. Let me elaborate on these 5 key points using the next few slides. \n Turning to Slide 4. We've been using this slide quarter-to-quarter to talk about our end markets and illustrate activity in each of our regions around the world. A red button on the slide indicates sluggish performance. A green bucket -- green button indicates strong performance. And a yellow button indicates something in between. Cloud and hyperscale and colocation markets have been very strong and remain strong across all regions. The demand for digital applications, online education, telemedicine, video and gaming is booming, benefiting our cloud and colocation customers and driving a strong and growing need for Vertiv products and services around the world. \n In our enterprise, small and medium business market, we're seeing signs of improvement as well. Our 2 reds have now turned yellow, but it's still not clear when the entire enterprise segment will open up. We are, however, encouraged to see things moving in the right direction. \n The communication networks market stayed constant in Americas and EMEA. It improved in APAC over the quarter, and we were able to see a shift in the market from yellow to green. Americas and APAC are performing strongly in this segment. Americas activity is driven by several large U.S. telecom carriers and the continued rollout of 5G. \n In the commercial and industrial market this quarter, EMEA has shifted from red to yellow. And because of that, we are now showing solid yellows across all regions, indicating some positive movement in the commercial and industrial space. \n All the end markets we serve are good -- are in very good shape now, as illustrated by the rays of yellows and green across the slide for Q1. \n Digital applications continue to increase their importance in everyday life. There's no -- they're no longer nice to have but a necessity for individuals and for businesses. The increasing need means there's an increasing demand for the processing, storage and transmission of data, which creates significant opportunity for Vertiv, and we are perfectly poised to go after that opportunity. \n Moving to Slide 5. I'd like to make a few comments regarding supply and demand. As I mentioned earlier, the overall market demand is strong, as evidenced by our order rates and backlog, which has resulted in us raising guidance. Each of our regions saw revenue growth in the first quarter, led by continued strength in cloud and colocation markets. Our cloud and colocation customers continue to build data centers in an aggressive but balanced fashion, and we will continue to partner with them to meet the strong and growing demand. \n We continue to stay vigilant around COVID, keeping our employees, our customers and our partners safe wherever they are in the world. That is our main priority. We have made adaptations where necessary and have found solutions to business challenges brought on by COVID. We remain confident in our ability to serve our customers and meet their needs. Yet, similar to other companies, we are facing some supply chain issues due to market conditions. \n There are a couple of things that are going on here. First, we find ourselves dealing with some parts shortages and materials. For the most part, we've identified solutions for those. Second, like many other companies, we are seeing cost increases on both material and the logistics side. This is being tracked and managed and closely monitored, and we are taking actions to offset the increased costs. \n But nonetheless, this is a short-term headwind. We've been planning to implement some footprint optimization programs. We have pivoted and decided to delay some of those programs to take advantage of the strong demand environment. The footprint optimization plan will be executed, but it will happen a little bit later than originally expected. \n Moving to Slide 6. I've talked to you in the past about our Vertiv product development process, VPD, and you all know about the allocations and resources we have made to research and development. So I wanted to show you a few of the new products. I can't tell you how thrilled I am with the progress that's being made in our engineering teams and all those that are responsible for executing our strategy to innovate, design and build products for the future. \n Here are some early results on this slide. The first product, shown in the upper left, will formally be launched tomorrow, and it's another way that we're helping our customers to become more efficient and provide lower carbon offerings. It is a grid interactive UPS, which will allow data center operators to use the UPS to power their data center and during low power times, to inject power back into the grid to drive the efficient use of data center equipment. \n On the upper right is the newest addition to our thermal offerings. We continue to innovate in the thermal space to drive more efficiencies and to provide best solutions for our customers. This product provides liquid cooling for high-density servers and racks, providing customers with an efficient way to cool their high-density applications. \n Finally, on the bottom of the chart, you will see 2 of our new edge offerings. The product on the lower left is a small UPS that's very efficient, very compact and utilizes the latest in lithium battery technology for longer time back -- for longer backup time. The product on the lower right is our newest single rack data center, which includes integrated UPS, power distribution, thermal management and our secure switch. This is a preconfigured solution and is a great example of the type of product we are bringing to the market for distributed IT and new edge applications. \n I really could talk hours about the research and development at Vertiv, but wanted to highlight a few of the new products so you can understand how we're focusing our R&D efforts and allowing us to bring these innovative solutions and offerings to our customers into the market. \n With that, I'll turn it over to David for a closer look at the Q1 numbers and come back at the end with some final comments. David? \nDavid Fallon: Great. Thanks, Rob. First, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter results versus last year. Net sales were up $201 million or 22.4%, 19.5% when adjusted for a $26 million foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders, which were up 21% in the first quarter after increasing 10% in full year 2020. Adjusted operating profit increased $92 million or over 450%, primarily driven by the profit flow-through from the higher sales and the benefit from SPAC transaction costs in last year's first quarter, all translates into a 790 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted EPS at $0.21 is $0.86 higher than last year, driven by the improved operations and a $0.54 benefit from the $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $21 million of SPAC transaction costs in last year's first quarter. Our sales and profitability performance converted into strong free cash flow of $43 million, $246 million higher than last year's first quarter, and we will review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple of slides. \n So turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $35 million or 7.5%, driven by growth -- strong growth with hyperscale customers in our critical infrastructure and solutions product segment. Net sales in APAC increased $133 million or 60%, in part due to an approximate $50 million COVID impact on sales in last year's first quarter, but we otherwise experienced strong growth across most APAC subregions and market verticals, including data centers, telecom and commercial and industrial. Net sales in EMEA were up $33 million or 16%, predominantly in the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, driven by several larger colocation projects. From a profitability perspective, adjusted operating margin improved across all 3 regions, primarily due to the leverage benefit of relatively flat or lower fixed costs on significantly higher net sales in each region, providing a practical example of the potential margin benefit of maintaining fixed cost constant while growing the top line. \n Next, turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges first quarter free cash flow from last year. The $246 million increase is primarily a result of higher adjusted operating profit, lower cash interest payments and improved trade working capital in addition to a $21 million year-over-year benefit from SPAC cash transaction costs last year. The $43 million of free cash flow in the quarter was higher than our internal expectations, primarily driven by the timing of a cash disbursement of approximately $25 million at the end of March due to a system implementation. So we anticipated that cash outflow to occur at the end of March, actually occurred at the beginning of April. Although it does not impact free cash flow, we received $107 million at the beginning of the first quarter, pursuant to the final public warrant redemptions. And this certainly facilitated a record-high liquidity of $1.1 billion and a record-low net debt leverage ratio of 2.3x at the end of the first quarter. \n Next, turning to Slide 10. We wanted to address the change related to the accounting for our warrants. Last week, we issued a press release and filed an 8-K providing more detail on this matter. But pursuant to new guidance released by the SEC on April 12, we changed the historical and prospective accounting for both our public and private warrants to record a liability for the fair value of these warrants. And with any subsequent change in fair value, adjusting the liability and recording a noncash nonoperating gain or loss in the P&L. When our stock price increases, the liability increases and we record a noncash loss. When our stock price declines, the liability declines, and we record a noncash gain. \n As a result of this change, we will file an amended 2020 10-K in the coming days, reflecting these changes, including recognizing additional noncash nonoperating expense of approximately $144 million in fiscal year 2020 as our stock price increased significantly during the year. We also recognized a $14 million noncash loss in the first quarter. This warrant gain or loss is recorded below operating profit, and it will not impact any of our non-GAAP operating metrics, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. \n So next, turning to Slide 11, looking forward. This page summarizes our second quarter financial guidance. We expect first quarter top line momentum to continue in the second quarter, with net sales up 20% at the midpoint, with strong growth across all 3 regions. And our second quarter sales is also expected to be up 10% sequentially from the first quarter. We guide towards adjusted operating profit of $125 million at the midpoint, up 21% from last year despite a $30 million headwind from one-off COVID cost actions in last year's second quarter and a $25 million increase in year-over-year growth in R&D investments. \n Adjusted operating margin is expected to be relatively flat, with contribution margin percentage slightly lower than last year due to commodity and logistics inflation. And despite higher year-over-year dollar fixed costs due to last year's COVID actions and incremental investment spending this year, fixed cost as a percentage of sales should be slightly lower. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to increase approximately $0.07 or 44% at the midpoint, driven by the higher adjusted operating profit and lower interest expense. \n Next, turning to Slide 12. We summarize our revised full year 2021 financial guidance, including higher net sales expectations to $4.9 billion, up 12% from 2020 and $125 million higher than our prior guidance, $60 million of that from the first quarter and -- or $60 million in the first quarter and $65 million over the remainder of the year based on our strong first quarter order performance and backlog. We are increasing our adjusted operating profit guidance to $595 million, up $20 million from prior guidance, and we will provide some detail of this increase on the next slide, including quantifying the expected net financial impact of the commodity and freight headwinds, as Rob discussed. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.11, $0.07 higher than our prior full year guidance, driven by higher projected -- adjusted operating profit, about $0.05 there, and lower interest expense from our first quarter term loan refinancing, about $0.02. Finally, we are increasing our full year projected free cash flow to $300 million, up $15 million from our prior guidance of $285 million. \n Turning to Slide 13. This chart bridges our full year adjusted operating profit from prior to current guidance, a net increase of $20 million, with a favorable $35 million coming from an incremental $125 million of net sales, however, converting at a rate lower than our average contribution margin due to product mix and higher marginal manufacturing costs, including expedited freight in some cases as we manage our capacity to meet the higher customer demand. Partially offsetting these volume benefits is a $15 million net headwind, including $25 million in commodity and freight inflation, approximately $15 million from commodities and $10 million from freight, both disproportionately impacting the Americas. This cost inflation is partially offset by an assumed $10 million of incremental pricing. And we believe there is further opportunity for additional incremental pricing as we progress through the year. \n With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Well, thanks, David. Overall, I'm very proud of the Vertiv team and what we've accomplished since becoming public. We've been executing our strategy, as Dave Cote has alluded, whether it's the VOS or the product development, all the levers we've talked about, and we feel really good about the next 2, 3 years as we continue to execute that strategy. I believe our results for this quarter have demonstrated the hard work and the effort of the 20,000 employees we have around the world. \n As I look into the balance of 2021, we continue to anticipate above market top line growth and increase in profitability and a strengthening balance sheet, all while continuing to invest in the strategic areas, as we've talked about, R&D and sales and marketing. \n To all the employees on the call today, thank you again for your dedication and your tireless effort to take care of our customers. To all the investors, thank you for being on the call today and for your support over the past year. \n I'll now turn it over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Rob, last quarter, you had mentioned that you thought order growth could sustain in the high single-digit range, but obviously, in Q1, you reported low 20% order growth. So maybe give us a little more color into what was the incremental upside versus your expectations. Was it more continued hyperscale and colo outperformance? Or was it an enterprise beginning to come back? And has your order outlook improved for the next few quarters where you can sustain more of this double-digit type order growth? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Great question. And you're absolutely dead on with the colo and hyperscale. Typically, those don't fall into our flow rate business. So those orders come when they come. And we look them in the pipeline, but when they want to release them. And typically, we'll get those orders anywhere from 3, 6, 9 months in advance of deploying those. And what we've seen certainly is a tightening market and longer potential lead times. And I think as we look at the global build-out continue, it's just stronger than we necessarily expected and probably saw people making sure they get in line to get their supply going forward. \n So -- but I'm encouraged going forward, and you've seen -- I know a couple of others have released today, Google and Microsoft. And we're seeing strong and continue to see strong growth there on a global basis. So I'm positive to that. And as I mentioned earlier in the call or in my script I was going through, we are seeing signs of really good life in the enterprise. We'll see when that fully turns back on, and that could be additive as we watch that come back to life. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: And then Dave, can you give us a little more color into the Q2 guide in the sense that you actually forecast Q2 sales to be up $100 million versus Q1, but adjusted operating margin at the midpoint looks relatively similar. So I think you said fixed costs would be lower as a percentage of sales versus a year ago in Q2. But what does that metric look like versus Q1? And what are the headwinds sequentially? Maybe FX not as good? Do you dial in more negative [indiscernible] cost and higher investment spend? Maybe you could go over the pieces for us a little bit, that would be helpful. \nDavid Fallon: Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Andy. So if you look at the components sequentially, so Q1 adjusted operating profit was $112 million. We're guiding $125 million, so $13 million increase. We do anticipate to see a straight pass-through from a profit perspective on the higher sales. I think sales are up $110 million or so sequentially. We do expect to see a 40% drop there -- on those additional sales. So we don't see any negative impact from a contribution margin percentage perspective in Q2 versus Q1. \n Really, a little bit of a drag quarter-over-quarter Q2 from Q1 is on the fixed cost side. So we anticipate probably about $20 million of higher fixed costs in Q2 versus Q1. And a lot of that is driven by the timing of R&D and growth investments. And in fact, we had planned $10 million of R&D and growth investments in the first quarter, and a good portion of that actually slipped into Q2 because of the timing of hiring and the launching of a few projects. \n But the other element that has an impact sequentially is the annoying FX gain and loss dynamic. So we had a $7 million FX transaction gain in the first quarter. Based on the weakening of the euro at the end of the quarter, the euro has since recovered from [ 1 17 ] up to close to [ 1 21 ]. So we probably have about a $10 million headwind from that FX transaction gain/loss dynamic in Q2 versus Q1. \n So all that flushes out relatively flat adjusted operating margin right around 10.2%, 10.3%. But as a result of the timing of some of the fixed costs, the actual dollar increase in adjusted operating profit is probably lighter than what some expectations are. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: The company mentioned that product mix and higher marginal manufacturing costs are impacting margins this year. I was hoping you could be a little bit more specific on what those issues are. And are you expecting those to be more temporal issues? Or is that something that could continue into next year? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Mark. This is David. I'll start, and Rob and Gary can add on. So yes, we called out an additional $15 million, and this is current guidance versus prior guidance as it relates to these additional mix and incremental manufacturing costs. \n From a product perspective, if you look at our product segments, our critical infrastructure and solutions product segment is a relatively lower margin than the other 2. And some of that -- or a good portion of the $125 million incremental sales are in that product segment. And so if you look at incremental, $15 million probably, half of that is related to that product mix. The other half is related to satisfying the demands of our customers. \n So I mentioned in my comments, we have -- in order to meet customer demands, in certain cases, we've had to enlist expedite freight. In addition, we have ramped up our capacity in some of our facilities, including adding shifts and temporary labor. And as a result, some of these marginal incremental sales are coming in at a little bit lower contribution margin than we would otherwise anticipate. \n We would expect -- these additional manufacturing costs certainly will be temporary. We do have a long-term capacity planning project that is ongoing, which will support the higher growth, and we believe we'll be able to transition away from a lot of these higher incremental costs in the second half of the year. So a lot of this incremental cost that we're seeing, we do anticipate in the second quarter. \nMark Delaney: Okay. That's helpful. And a follow-up question, I was hoping to better understand how the company is thinking about deploying free cash flow going forward. I mean, there's been really good progress reducing debt, lowering your interest expense. And the opportunity has been discussed at some point in the future. Perhaps the company could return to doing some tuck-in M&A or perhaps even a larger-scale M&A, which there's been some success with historically. I know there's a few acquisitions the company has been pretty happy with. And I think investors are interested in what potential there may be to do that type of acquisitions going forward. So any updated thoughts you can share about how you're thinking about deploying free cash flow going forward. And is M&A something that you're considering? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Mark, this is Rob. I appreciate the question, and I'll start and then throw it over to David. But as we've talked about before in past calls, we do have an active funnel of potential companies that we think would make sense to be part of our portfolio. As Dave Cote has always said, opportunities and -- present themselves, not necessarily in timing, not when you want them to. And so we continue to work through that list and keep those type relationships and have eyes on things. \n As we've talked about before, it's always been about deleveraging first, and I think we've done a pretty good job doing that and have ourselves in a pretty good position to do some things if the opportunity positions itself. And we are actively -- always actively looking, but nothing that's imminent that we can talk about today. David? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I totally agree, Rob. And I would say this is a very pleasant position to be in as a CFO. So I think pre-SPAC transaction last year, we were over 6x levered. So to get that down closer to 2 really demonstrates the free cash flow DNA of this business, and it absolutely provides us the flexibility to be strategic with our balance sheet. We certainly don't have a strategy to do a deal because we think we need to do a deal, but we will be patient. And we certainly have the flexibility to do something relatively quickly if the right opportunity arises. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. \nAmit Daryanani: I have 2 as well. First off, when I think about this 10% organic growth, we're talking about 2021, can you perhaps provide some dimension on how do you think about the various segments, purely hyperscale, enterprise, communications, doing? And maybe what I'm really trying to get to is I want to understand what happens to your growth vectors if enterprise grows from yellow to green over the next [indiscernible]. \nRob Johnson: Well, listen, Amit, thanks for the question. And Gary and I will work this one together with you. But I would say, in general, the way we've looked at things is conservatively seeing enterprise come back online. Although I've been talking for a couple of quarters, the thing that gives me the comfort that it will is the quoting activity and the level of quotes. \n So I would say that as we see the enterprise turn from yellow to green, certainly, there's potentially some upside from that perspective. But I would say, in general, we continue to see the strength in the colo and the hyperscale. And as I mentioned in my comments, we think they're being very diligent about their build-outs as they go forward based on capacity needs that we see kind of around the globe. I don't know. Gary, any thoughts? \nGary Niederpruem: I think that's right, Rob. I think, Amit, that we were pleased to be able to upgrade that enterprise segment from red to yellow. We know we had a lot of conversation around that in February. So we've definitely seen enough strength throughout pointing the quoting in the pipeline where we felt comfortable upgrading that segment to go from yellow to green. I think we need a little bit more. And maybe towards the end of the year, we'll get there. It's a little bit unclear, but certainly feel squarely comfortable that, that enterprise is coming back in the segment that we would traditionally talk about. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I can just follow up. The fiscal '21 guide from a profit dollar basis, I think there's a $65 million of investments in growth [indiscernible] has called out. I'm curious. Is this -- do you think\n [Technical Difficulty] \nRob Johnson: Operator, we probably want to move to the next and see if Amit gets back in the queue. I think we lost him. \nOperator: Amit, are you there? \nAmit Daryanani: I'm here. Can you hear me? \nRob Johnson: Yes, we can hear you now. Welcome back. \nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. We'll blame it on the mute function. I was going to ask you on the fiscal '21 operating profit guidance, I mean you talked about the $65 million of investments in growth in R&D. I would like to understand, how do you think about payback from these investments? And do we think about this $65 million kind of a 1-year thing? Or could it sustain for a couple of years? \nRob Johnson: Yes, great question. First, I'll answer the last part of that and then get to the first. We have talked about in our strategy that we want to get to about 6% overall of -- for R&D. And so we've seen some ratchets up over the last couple of this year and last year and even next year to get to that 6%. And we plan on kind of holding it at that just based on the need, right? Really, what we're doing is taking a look at the funnel of projects, the collaboration that's needed by our customers, and doing what we need to do to really drive innovative solutions that will help us outpace the market growth and take share as we go forward. Certainly, there's not a lack of activities that we believe we can do to create more value for our customers and ultimately more value for the share owners. But as you think about it going forward, you think about it getting to about a 6% level, and we think that will be sufficient with the growth rate that we're going to have, which would give us additional R&D dollars every year, just holding it at 6%. Now David, any other thoughts? \nDavid Fallon: No, just from a numbers perspective, so that $65 million, it's -- at least for 2021, $35 million of that is R&D and with the remainder $30 million related to sales and marketing. And to Rob's point on R&D, last year, we spent $230 million on R&D, add another $35 million this year, that's $265 million. And based on the most recent top line guidance, that's 4.5% to 5%. So to get to 6%, there's certainly going to be some additional step changes over the next couple of years. And of course, the dollar amount also increases, all other things being equal, just with the top line increasing. \n And the one thing I can tell you is that this is not a capital rationing exercise. There are plenty of projects out there. So there is an efficiency and productivity perspective. You can only do so many. So there, the ability to increase this dollar spend, we're not chasing the last dollar. So there is plenty of opportunity for us to continue to invest. And all of these projects have really, really good returns, and that probably was the first question. And that payback period is anywhere from 12 to 24 months, depending on the specific project. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: So can we start with the outlook for revenue [indiscernible]. When you think about where organic growth is getting better expectations, particularly with respect to like [ 4Q ], can you talk about that segment? And any color you have in the second quarter? \nRob Johnson: Nicole, you were cutting in and out a little bit. Is it possible to restate the question? Just -- we were getting every third word here. \nNicole DeBlase: Yes, sorry about that. Is this any better? \nRob Johnson: A little bit, yes. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. I was just looking for color on full year organic revised and Q2 organic segments. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David, and I can ask Rob and Gary to add some color. We don't provide guidance as it relates to a product segment perspective, and we can give some color on that. But certainly, from a regional perspective, if you look at Q2 this year versus last year and the 17% expected organic growth, give or take, that's going to be pretty strong across all 3 regions. So probably low single digits in the Americas, and in both APAC and EMEA, somewhat over a 20% growth. So this is not a situation -- the reason we mentioned that is this is not a situation where we anticipate another 40% or 50% growth in one region and all the other 2 regions are single digits. So we're expecting strong growth in Q2 across all 3 regional segments. \n Now when you look at first half versus second half, and all the numbers are out there, so everybody can do the math. It certainly does imply lower organic growth in the second half of the year. So organic growth in the first half of between 15% and 20%, that would imply low single digits in the second half of the year. What we can tell you is we did not expect that low single-digit to be uniform in Q3 and Q4. We do anticipate Q3 from a percentage growth perspective to be higher than the year-over-year growth that we see in Q4. So Q4, last year, if you recall, presents a very, very challenging comp, right? We had sales over $1.3 billion, including exceptional sales in EMEA based on the timing of some larger projects and also APAC. So there could be some conservatism built into our guidance in the fourth quarter. We just don't have the visibility at this point to really lean forward too much on Q4. And we do anticipate that to have more information related to orders and pipeline when we update our guidance in Q2. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And just for my follow-up, I know you guys are trying to offset some of these extra costs of pricing. Can you just talk about the general pricing environment and maybe the competitive landscape? \nRob Johnson: That's a great question, Nicole. We have, as we've talked about before, been able to get price the last year, couple of years. I think we're getting pretty good at doing that. When we've had times before where freight costs have gone up like they have been, we've been able to institute surcharges. Sometimes that's lagging, and I mentioned a few -- in some of my comments, some of the lagging to pick that up. And then based on contracts and orders, working with our customers, everyone understands that commodity prices are going up, steel is doubled, that type of thing. \n Our customers are pretty good about working with us and going through that. Certainly, we're able to go forward price things at that higher cost rate. And we're able to get that. So we feel good. We have $10 million, I think Dave showed in his bridge, of incremental additional pricing this year. While that's something we're striving for, we think we could probably do better than that. But based on what we see, based on where we're at, that's kind of what we built into our plan. But no, we've got a pretty good process now in our ability to drive prices through with our customers on a global scale. \nOperator: Next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Appreciate the commentary, as usual. But I'm going to go back to a few questions ago on the enterprise side, small, medium segment. What's your sense of the age of the installed base in that category, meaning when you go from yellow to green, is it going to be kind of green on steroids because not only is everybody back in the building, but they're back in the building with old equipment that's going to age out pretty quickly? Is that a fair way to think about it? \nRob Johnson: Well, I guess, yes, the way to kind of think about it, Scott, would be that during COVID period, people haven't been spending, and that equipment will. I can't give you an exact what the installed base would actually look like and what that ramp would be. What we are seeing early signs of is people upgrading their closets as they drive more to cloud and colo, upgrading their network closets, refurbishing old gear, certainly where there's old batteries and that type of thing. \n So certainly, when it goes to bright green, we would expect to see probably stronger than traditional growth in that enterprise because there's been -- and the reason I say that is we see the quoting activity. We see what's happening at the engineering side of things. And we do believe when that frees up, I don't know if it all happens overnight or it's a slow, kind of like we saw in this last quarter, slowly easing back into it. I mean I think a lot of it's going to be determined around what happens with the back to work with COVID vaccine, which we can't predict. But I think those things can be correlated and tied to people saying, I feel good about spending again. When people are back in the office, they're used to this level of service at home now. With the remote working, they're going to want to make sure that their gear in the office is where it needs to be. \nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And then as a -- just a point of clarification, the -- is there anything in your covenants or kind of structure -- this is my first SPAC coverage, to be fair -- that would preclude buybacks of any magnitude? \nDavid Fallon: This is Dave. Scott, there is not. There is not. \nScott Davis: Okay. Okay. So if your leverage ratio were to get, let's say, under 2 turns or something and you wanted to do a buyback debt, that's in the cards, correct? \nDavid Fallon: That is one of the options on the table for us, absolutely. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: First question may be actually related to Scott's. Services in Americas, at what point do we start to see some traction there? Does it end up being actually tied to kind of new equipment on the enterprise side? I wouldn't think it's directly related, but they kind of seem to be tracking similar? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. Jeff, it's Gary. So I would say, I think there's a couple of things. One is, first quarter in Americas for service was down a little bit primarily because of 2 main issues. One is, if you remember, we had those horrible storms that rolled through most of the U.S., a lot of it in the Southeast and Texas area. So that prevented some site access and pushed some jobs out a little bit. The other portion of it was we have a decently large commercial and industrial service business in the U.S., and that was lagging just because a lot of that is vectored towards utilities, oil and gas, which obviously were depressed from an order standpoint last year. So that business is coming back online. Now we see really pretty strong order rates there, number one. Two, clearly, the weather issue is temporal and that is behind us. So we would expect to see acceleration in that service business, particularly in the Americas as the year goes on. \nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And on the new 3 phase product, one of your competitors has got something similar that they're talking about. And it's part of what they're talking about developing with that is actually a bit of a SaaS model, too, where they can share with the utility on some of the savings or selling back to the grid. Is that sort of thing available with your product? Are you exploring new business models like that? Maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on that particular product and anything else interesting in the pipeline. \nRob Johnson: Great, Jeff, this is Rob. Yes, absolutely. So when we get -- where we are in the belief, the good interaction, we've actually had pilots going for months and even over a year over in Europe, where we'll do that kind of sharing model, revenue-sharing model with the utility where you'll go on battery and inject power back on the grid and/or just free up power for the grid. So there's a couple of different revenue-sharing models there. So as we get more sophisticated and people realize that, hey, it's still reliable infrastructure, even though you're on battery and people get more comfortable with that, we think that, that grid -- and in order to -- the grid interaction is going to play a big part of it. In order for people to drive more carbon friendly, they're going to have to be doing those types of things as well. So we see that and interacting with the grid, whether it's behind-the-meter storage or in front of the meter. And I talked about this before as an area, an adjacency and a growth area as we go forward.\n So as it relates to -- we'll continue to focus, as we've talked about in the past, thermal management requires -- draws most of the utility expense within a data center, and we continue to drive more efficient, effective solutions, utilizing software controls, AI around that. So we expect to see things like that in the future from us that will just drive that and helping that carbon get to that carbon neutral position. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Lance Vitanza with Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: I have 2. The first is, last fall, you announced that you would be collaborating, working with Honeywell to improve sustainability for data center operations. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that effort has rolled out. Have you seen results yet? Or are we still in the planning or preliminary stages? Are you in the market with joint offerings? How, if at all, does this partnership or this collaboration differentiate you? \nRob Johnson: Lance, yes, we're really happy with the progress we're making with Honeywell on the collaboration. And that collaboration, we talked about a few different things. I think the first thing we talked about was kind of a software and controls thing to drive more efficiency, where we're piloting that. So we're more than just the planning phase. We've got some pilots. I think a bigger part of the collaboration is us working together globally and bringing Honeywell into areas that they necessarily haven't been into with their software offering, which is a very, very robust offering, along with our equipment and to drive more efficiency as we go through the data center. So we are -- the teams are working together globally and expect -- this isn't something that happens overnight, but expect over time, you'll see more and more of kind of the Honeywell-Vertiv solution showing up in data centers driving -- and really driving efficiency and then joint collaborating on customers they may have, but we aren't currently doing business with and vice versa. \nLance Vitanza: And then just maybe one last one for me. On Slide 13, where you lay out the bridge and focusing on the cost pressures and sourcing and so forth, you show the $10 million kind of recovery from passing price-throughs and this $25 million hit from commodity and logistics headwinds. And I guess my question is, how are those 2 numbers related? In other words, if it turns out that the commodity and logistics turns out to be maybe a $50 million headwind, should we assume that you can pass on perhaps $20 million of the costs? Are they variable in that way? Or no, is it sort of like a hard stop? You think it's going to be tough to pass on more than $10 million so we just need to hope that the impact from the logistics isn't much greater than that? Could you comment on that? \nDavid Fallon: Yes, Lance, this is David. I'll start, and Gary and Rob can jump in. I would definitely say the 2 are correlated, right? The higher the commodity logistics headwind and inflation is, the more data we have and to reasonably take price up consistently with competitors, right? So there's definitely a high correlation. The one thing that we're seeing here is that there's generally a lag. So we will see the negative impact from commodity and logistics sooner in our costs, then we do have the ability to pass that through for higher pricing.\n Now one thing that we did see, which turns this into somewhat of a positive, the last time we saw significant commodity and logistics headwinds, what we found is that the pricing is actually a little bit sticky upwards. So we actually look at this strategically as a way to get additional price. And then if the commodity and logistics headwinds abate at some point this year or even early next year, generally, the pricing that we see remains where it's at. There's always some give and take. But on the way up, that pricing opportunity is certainly going to be correlated with the headwinds we're seeing.\n And the other thing that I probably want to point out on this slide and remind folks is that this is versus prior guidance. So this is the overlay for additional commodity and logistics headwinds versus our beginning of the year assumptions. If you looked at this for a full year, we had about $20 million of headwinds for commodity and freight inflation in that beginning of the year guidance. So if you add the $20 million and the $25 million, you get about $45 million. We also had assumed about $15 million of pricing in that prior guidance as well. So full year pricing expectations are now right around $25 million. And if there is additional inflation, we do believe there's opportunity to take those pricing assumptions up as well. \nOperator: Next question will come from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Just rounding out the rest of those bridge items, I think you had like positive $45 million for productivity for kind of a -- that would be kind of a net $40 million contribution margin, I think. Now it looks like it's $10 million for contribution margin, but first half is negative 20%. So I guess the second half kind of has to flip. I mean are you guys assuming that things -- I mean like what -- can you maybe round out the other portions of the annual kind of year-over-year bridge for us? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David, Steve. And I think everybody's had some time now to kind of put the Sudoku puzzle together and I'd say you did it correctly. So yes. The implication for margin is that there'd be about $35 million favorable year-over-year variance in the second half, and that offsets about $20 million unfavorable variance in the first half. So the reason you see favorability in the second half is because of the timing of some of these initiatives. We do assume that pricing will ramp up as we go through the year. So the $25 million in total, there's probably a relatively small number in the first quarter, and that will ramp up as we go through the year, in addition to our productivity opportunities. And a lot of those are around the purchasing side, completely independent from price. And though as well ramp up as we go through the year. So -- and almost sequentially. So Q4 is also significantly higher than what we're seeing in Q1. \nC. Stephen Tusa: And are you making any explicit call on kind of like the movement in these inflationary items, like the price of freight or the price of commodities, things like that? \nDavid Fallon: We do assume that what we're seeing today pretty much continues through the remainder of the year, probably with a little bit of a throttle down in the fourth quarter. We think it could obviously get worse. Steel is up 115% in Q1 this year versus last year. If you listen to the experts out there, a lot of that price was based on a ramp-up in demand and a slower response from the supply as they kind of ramp up mills. So I think everybody anticipates that it can't get much worse from a steel pricing perspective, which is our most exposed commodity. But I guess it could. But we feel pretty good with the provision we've included in the forecast as it relates to commodities, and we do assume it pretty much extends through the rest of the year. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Got it. Okay. Any dynamics in the back half on mix, I guess services, if that kind of flips positive that, that could be a positive mix driver on anything on that front? \nDavid Fallon: We -- there's 2 elements of mix we look at. We look at product mix, and we also look at regional mix. So certainly, we had a little bit of a headwind in Q1 from a regional perspective based on the significant growth in APAC year-over-year. That will update as we go through the year. But if you look at individual quarters, it likely is not going to be a significant player from a -- from a product perspective, we do believe that, I think in the first quarter, the critical infrastructure and solutions business was probably 50% of our total business last year. I think that ramped up closer to 60% in Q1. We don't see a similar dynamic through the remainder of the year, but as we're seeing, some of the additional sales we added to our guide are skewed a little bit more to that CI&S. So mix could be different each quarter, but we don't see it as significant as a headwind over the remainder of the year as we saw in the [Audio Gap] \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: So the first question for me on your IT channel. A big growth initiative for you guys. There's been some consolidation. How do you view Eaton's acquisition of Tripp Lite? Does it really change the end market that much, from your perspective? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Andrew, Rob Johnson here. I really don't want to necessarily comment on what the competitors are going to do or not do. We -- consolidation sometimes gives an opportunity for companies like ours to be able to be in that top 2 or 3 bidding perspective. So they usually like to have 3 bidders. And so I see that as a potential positive for us as we go forward. We're really focused on our innovative solutions that we're bringing to market, our thermal management and kind of that total solutions approach in the channel, which we think globally, we've got a really good position and strong there. \n So while not necessarily focused on Tripp Lite and Eaton, what's going on there, we're really focused on bringing those new products to market and driving innovation against our competitors to gain share. And as you can see in our IRS business, we did have decent year-over-year growth. We've seen that for the last several quarters now and expect to continue to see that grow as we introduce more products into that venue. And not all IRS business is in the channel. So it's not necessarily indicative of the channel because we do sell -- the C&I business as well falls within that channel space. \nAndrew Obin: Yes. And then a bigger picture, and bigger-picture question, right? I mean if you think you have technology-focused global business, it does seem if you look at the legislative action, there are pretty big bills cooking up in Congress in regards to China, in regards to incentivizing technology R&D -- technology and R&D investment in the U.S. And it was your philosophy to optimize your existing manufacturing footprint, right, and just drive high and higher volume. Does this sort of change your thinking, the sort of bifurcation of the tech world perhaps into, I guess, President Biden uses the term techno-democracies and techno-autocracies. Have you guys thought about it? Does it change your approach to manufacturing footprint, your sourcing? A pretty open-ended question, but it seems there are sort of big headlines, at least, coming on this topic and you guys in the middle of it, just given what you do for a living. \nRob Johnson: Andrew, thank you for your question. I don't think it really changes. We're a little bit different than maybe some of our competitive -- companies out there have always been kind of more or less an in country-for-country or an in region-for-region. What we did do over the last couple of years from an R&D perspective is really drive to a matrix and put center of excellence all over the world, not necessarily in best cost locations, but in the right place to be developing those products. So I think you'll find both our R&D investments, which are [ pulling full ] in the U.S. and in the Americas and in Europe and in Asia Pac, and I think you'll find that fairly balanced. And so we were already doing that.\n I think COVID has taught us a lesson about second sourcing vendors and making sure that we have more in region, and we've made some moves based on COVID to be even more regional from that perspective, which probably plays in the hands of some of the stuff Biden is doing. But in general, I don't think that's driving our thoughts right now. But I feel really comfortable with the footprint we have from a development perspective. And as we look at how we do things, we're, in some cases, a highly-engineered product, and freight and everything is important in speed to market is important. So being closer to our customers, not just using an Asian source and bringing that in, it has been part of our strategy and will continue to be that. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: So Andrew, strong points, so I'll take that quote up. So obviously, we're pushing well past the hour mark here. I'll keep this pretty quick. I want to go back to the pricing. You covered that very well. So I'm not going to retread any new ground here. But 20 bps of additional price doesn't seem like a shoot-for-the-moon scenario, but how does the backlog play into the pricing equation for the second half of the year? You've got $2.1 billion of backlog, it's about 2 quarters worth of sales, not quite 2 quarters. But are we thinking here that the price increases are mainly in the fourth quarter, given that backlog coverage? Or is there some mechanism in the backlog to push through some digital price? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. Nigel, it's Gary. So I'd say the answer is mixed and varied. I mean obviously, it's a little bit easier to get price on new orders. But by no means are we just taking a look at that $2 billion of backlog and saying, well, there's nothing we can do. It's already in backlog. So we do have some other mechanisms, sometimes in larger contracts that have material clauses in them. Certainly, freight is another lever that we can utilize. That is a real-time mechanism. There's been times when we've instituted surcharges as well. So I would say that, yes, it's easier to get price on new orders coming through the door. But by no means are we going to just discount the $2 billion that we have and say there's nothing we can do there. We're looking at that, taking action on that as well. With all that said, I do think price probably continues to ramp throughout the year, as David mentioned earlier. So I think in general, that pricing will ramp. But those are the different ways we're looking and trying to execute that pricing and freight scenario. \nNigel Coe: That's great. And then my follow-on question is around market share. And we don't really have a lot of good information from your competitors in terms of their growth rates. It's always double-digit growth and strong growth but there's no quantification. So I'm just curious, obviously, you see the bids and quotes in the RT activity. How do you feel your share is tracking relative to the last 2 or 3 or 4 months? And where do you think you're gaining or even losing share? \nRob Johnson: Nigel, this is Rob. I'll start and then let Gary follow in. And one thing I think all of us on the call need to remember is, typically, people talk about a couple of the big 3 or 4, but as you look at the pie charts we've shared in the past, there's a lot of gray area, which is smaller, more regional players that play into this from that perspective. So you got to be careful just watching us versus some of the other competitors that are our size and really look at how we think about things, and part of our strategy was taking share from those more local mom and pop, where we failed to innovate early on or provide a solution and now can provide a solution and provide that globally.\n So I think we feel -- across the board, we feel really good about where we're at from a thermal position and from a power position as well. And again, you'll have some local players that we go up against, and then we'll go up with some of the global players. But overall, we -- with our strong growth that we've actually posted the last couple of years, we think we've been outpacing the industry, which would mean that we either get more of our fair share and taking some share from that perspective. But when you look at kind of a broader question, is there's a whole another 50% of the pie that's made up of a bunch of small mom-and-pops, pieces that are moving around. I don't know. Gary? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. Nigel, I think Rob said it beautifully. Just analytically, you're right, that's sort of the maddening -- one of the maddening things about the market is you can't just peg it to a specific number of is this what the market grew or shrank. To the best of our ability, if you go back to '19, we think the market probably grew low to mid-single digits and 3%, 4%, and we grew at 6%. And then if you take a look at last year, the best sources, we think that the market probably shrank 4%-ish, and we were down 1 point organically. So you take those 2 different data points and you say, okay, it's consecutively back-to-back years now, we think we've pretty squarely outperformed the market by that 1.5x goal that we've established. And certainly, with the strong start to Q1, don't have any signs of letting up at this point by any means. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks. \nRob Johnson: Well, thank you, and I appreciate everyone attending our call today. As you can tell, we're really excited about the Q1 results, but really the go-forward and the execution of the strategy that we set out and shared with all of you, and we'll continue to drive that as we go forward. Again, I appreciate that support. Thank you, and have a great day. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "I think that's right, Rob. I think, Amit, that we were pleased to be able to upgrade that enterprise segment from red to yellow. We know we had a lot of conversation around that in February. So we've definitely seen enough strength throughout pointing the quoting in the pipeline where we felt comfortable upgrading that segment to go from yellow to green. I think we need a little bit more. And maybe towards the end of the year, we'll get there. It's a little bit unclear, but certainly feel squarely comfortable that, that enterprise is coming back in the segment that we would traditionally talk about. Yes. Jeff, it's Gary. So I would say, I think there's a couple of things. One is, first quarter in Americas for service was down a little bit primarily because of 2 main issues. One is, if you remember, we had those horrible storms that rolled through most of the U.S., a lot of it in the Southeast and Texas area. So that prevented some site access and pushed some jobs out a little bit.

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Rob. First, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter results versus last year. Net sales were up $201 million or 22.4%, 19.5% when adjusted for a $26 million foreign exchange tailwind. We continued our strong momentum with orders, which were up 21% in the first quarter after increasing 10% in full year 2020. Adjusted operating profit increased $92 million or over 450%, primarily driven by the profit flow-through from the higher sales and the benefit from SPAC transaction costs in last year's first quarter, all translates into a 790 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. Adjusted EPS at $0.21 is $0.86 higher than last year, driven by the improved operations and a $0.54 benefit from the $174 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $21 million of SPAC transaction costs in last year's first quarter. Our sales and profitability performance converted into strong free cash flow of $43 million, $246 million higher than last year's first quarter, and we will review some of the drivers of this improved free cash flow in a couple of slides. \n So turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. Net sales in the Americas were up $35 million or 7.5%, driven by growth -- strong growth with hyperscale customers in our critical infrastructure and solutions product segment. Net sales in APAC increased $133 million or 60%, in part due to an approximate $50 million COVID impact on sales in last year's first quarter, but we otherwise experienced strong growth across most APAC subregions and market verticals, including data centers, telecom and commercial and industrial. Net sales in EMEA were up $33 million or 16%, predominantly in the critical infrastructure and solutions product segment, driven by several larger colocation projects. From a profitability perspective, adjusted operating margin improved across all 3 regions, primarily due to the leverage benefit of relatively flat or lower fixed costs on significantly higher net sales in each region, providing a practical example of the potential margin benefit of maintaining fixed cost constant while growing the top line. \n Next, turning to Slide 9. This chart bridges first quarter free cash flow from last year. The $246 million increase is primarily a result of higher adjusted operating profit, lower cash interest payments and improved trade working capital in addition to a $21 million year-over-year benefit from SPAC cash transaction costs last year. The $43 million of free cash flow in the quarter was higher than our internal expectations, primarily driven by the timing of a cash disbursement of approximately $25 million at the end of March due to a system implementation. So we anticipated that cash outflow to occur at the end of March, actually occurred at the beginning of April. Although it does not impact free cash flow, we received $107 million at the beginning of the first quarter, pursuant to the final public warrant redemptions. And this certainly facilitated a record-high liquidity of $1.1 billion and a record-low net debt leverage ratio of 2.3x at the end of the first quarter. \n Next, turning to Slide 10. We wanted to address the change related to the accounting for our warrants. Last week, we issued a press release and filed an 8-K providing more detail on this matter. But pursuant to new guidance released by the SEC on April 12, we changed the historical and prospective accounting for both our public and private warrants to record a liability for the fair value of these warrants. And with any subsequent change in fair value, adjusting the liability and recording a noncash nonoperating gain or loss in the P&L. When our stock price increases, the liability increases and we record a noncash loss. When our stock price declines, the liability declines, and we record a noncash gain. \n As a result of this change, we will file an amended 2020 10-K in the coming days, reflecting these changes, including recognizing additional noncash nonoperating expense of approximately $144 million in fiscal year 2020 as our stock price increased significantly during the year. We also recognized a $14 million noncash loss in the first quarter. This warrant gain or loss is recorded below operating profit, and it will not impact any of our non-GAAP operating metrics, including adjusted operating profit, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. \n So next, turning to Slide 11, looking forward. This page summarizes our second quarter financial guidance. We expect first quarter top line momentum to continue in the second quarter, with net sales up 20% at the midpoint, with strong growth across all 3 regions. And our second quarter sales is also expected to be up 10% sequentially from the first quarter. We guide towards adjusted operating profit of $125 million at the midpoint, up 21% from last year despite a $30 million headwind from one-off COVID cost actions in last year's second quarter and a $25 million increase in year-over-year growth in R&D investments. \n Adjusted operating margin is expected to be relatively flat, with contribution margin percentage slightly lower than last year due to commodity and logistics inflation. And despite higher year-over-year dollar fixed costs due to last year's COVID actions and incremental investment spending this year, fixed cost as a percentage of sales should be slightly lower. Finally, adjusted EPS is expected to increase approximately $0.07 or 44% at the midpoint, driven by the higher adjusted operating profit and lower interest expense. \n Next, turning to Slide 12. We summarize our revised full year 2021 financial guidance, including higher net sales expectations to $4.9 billion, up 12% from 2020 and $125 million higher than our prior guidance, $60 million of that from the first quarter and -- or $60 million in the first quarter and $65 million over the remainder of the year based on our strong first quarter order performance and backlog. We are increasing our adjusted operating profit guidance to $595 million, up $20 million from prior guidance, and we will provide some detail of this increase on the next slide, including quantifying the expected net financial impact of the commodity and freight headwinds, as Rob discussed. Full year adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.11, $0.07 higher than our prior full year guidance, driven by higher projected -- adjusted operating profit, about $0.05 there, and lower interest expense from our first quarter term loan refinancing, about $0.02. Finally, we are increasing our full year projected free cash flow to $300 million, up $15 million from our prior guidance of $285 million. \n Turning to Slide 13. This chart bridges our full year adjusted operating profit from prior to current guidance, a net increase of $20 million, with a favorable $35 million coming from an incremental $125 million of net sales, however, converting at a rate lower than our average contribution margin due to product mix and higher marginal manufacturing costs, including expedited freight in some cases as we manage our capacity to meet the higher customer demand. Partially offsetting these volume benefits is a $15 million net headwind, including $25 million in commodity and freight inflation, approximately $15 million from commodities and $10 million from freight, both disproportionately impacting the Americas. This cost inflation is partially offset by an assumed $10 million of incremental pricing. And we believe there is further opportunity for additional incremental pricing as we progress through the year. \n With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Andy. So if you look at the components sequentially, so Q1 adjusted operating profit was $112 million. We're guiding $125 million, so $13 million increase. We do anticipate to see a straight pass-through from a profit perspective on the higher sales. I think sales are up $110 million or so sequentially. We do expect to see a 40% drop there -- on those additional sales. So we don't see any negative impact from a contribution margin percentage perspective in Q2 versus Q1. \n Really, a little bit of a drag quarter-over-quarter Q2 from Q1 is on the fixed cost side. So we anticipate probably about $20 million of higher fixed costs in Q2 versus Q1. And a lot of that is driven by the timing of R&D and growth investments. And in fact, we had planned $10 million of R&D and growth investments in the first quarter, and a good portion of that actually slipped into Q2 because of the timing of hiring and the launching of a few projects. \n But the other element that has an impact sequentially is the annoying FX gain and loss dynamic. So we had a $7 million FX transaction gain in the first quarter. Based on the weakening of the euro at the end of the quarter, the euro has since recovered from [ 1 17 ] up to close to [ 1 21 ]. So we probably have about a $10 million headwind from that FX transaction gain/loss dynamic in Q2 versus Q1. \n So all that flushes out relatively flat adjusted operating margin right around 10.2%, 10.3%. But as a result of the timing of some of the fixed costs, the actual dollar increase in adjusted operating profit is probably lighter than what some expectations are. Yes. Thanks, Mark. This is David. I'll start, and Rob and Gary can add on. So yes, we called out an additional $15 million, and this is current guidance versus prior guidance as it relates to these additional mix and incremental manufacturing costs. \n From a product perspective, if you look at our product segments, our critical infrastructure and solutions product segment is a relatively lower margin than the other 2. And some of that -- or a good portion of the $125 million incremental sales are in that product segment. And so if you look at incremental, $15 million probably, half of that is related to that product mix. The other half is related to satisfying the demands of our customers. \n So I mentioned in my comments, we have -- in order to meet customer demands, in certain cases, we've had to enlist expedite freight. In addition, we have ramped up our capacity in some of our facilities, including adding shifts and temporary labor. And as a result, some of these marginal incremental sales are coming in at a little bit lower contribution margin than we would otherwise anticipate. \n We would expect -- these additional manufacturing costs certainly will be temporary. We do have a long-term capacity planning project that is ongoing, which will support the higher growth, and we believe we'll be able to transition away from a lot of these higher incremental costs in the second half of the year. So a lot of this incremental cost that we're seeing, we do anticipate in the second quarter. Yes. I totally agree, Rob. And I would say this is a very pleasant position to be in as a CFO. So I think pre-SPAC transaction last year, we were over 6x levered. So to get that down closer to 2 really demonstrates the free cash flow DNA of this business, and it absolutely provides us the flexibility to be strategic with our balance sheet. We certainly don't have a strategy to do a deal because we think we need to do a deal, but we will be patient. And we certainly have the flexibility to do something relatively quickly if the right opportunity arises. No, just from a numbers perspective, so that $65 million, it's -- at least for 2021, $35 million of that is R&D and with the remainder $30 million related to sales and marketing. And to Rob's point on R&D, last year, we spent $230 million on R&D, add another $35 million this year, that's $265 million. And based on the most recent top line guidance, that's 4.5% to 5%. So to get to 6%, there's certainly going to be some additional step changes over the next couple of years. And of course, the dollar amount also increases, all other things being equal, just with the top line increasing. \n And the one thing I can tell you is that this is not a capital rationing exercise. There are plenty of projects out there. So there is an efficiency and productivity perspective. You can only do so many. So there, the ability to increase this dollar spend, we're not chasing the last dollar. So there is plenty of opportunity for us to continue to invest. And all of these projects have really, really good returns, and that probably was the first question. And that payback period is anywhere from 12 to 24 months, depending on the specific project. Yes. This is David, and I can ask Rob and Gary to add some color. We don't provide guidance as it relates to a product segment perspective, and we can give some color on that. But certainly, from a regional perspective, if you look at Q2 this year versus last year and the 17% expected organic growth, give or take, that's going to be pretty strong across all 3 regions. So probably low single digits in the Americas, and in both APAC and EMEA, somewhat over a 20% growth. So this is not a situation -- the reason we mentioned that is this is not a situation where we anticipate another 40% or 50% growth in one region and all the other 2 regions are single digits. So we're expecting strong growth in Q2 across all 3 regional segments. \n Now when you look at first half versus second half, and all the numbers are out there, so everybody can do the math. It certainly does imply lower organic growth in the second half of the year. So organic growth in the first half of between 15% and 20%, that would imply low single digits in the second half of the year. What we can tell you is we did not expect that low single-digit to be uniform in Q3 and Q4. We do anticipate Q3 from a percentage growth perspective to be higher than the year-over-year growth that we see in Q4. So Q4, last year, if you recall, presents a very, very challenging comp, right? We had sales over $1.3 billion, including exceptional sales in EMEA based on the timing of some larger projects and also APAC. So there could be some conservatism built into our guidance in the fourth quarter. We just don't have the visibility at this point to really lean forward too much on Q4. And we do anticipate that to have more information related to orders and pipeline when we update our guidance in Q2. This is Dave. Scott, there is not. There is not. That is one of the options on the table for us, absolutely. Yes, Lance, this is David. I'll start, and Gary and Rob can jump in. I would definitely say the 2 are correlated, right? The higher the commodity logistics headwind and inflation is, the more data we have and to reasonably take price up consistently with competitors, right? So there's definitely a high correlation. The one thing that we're seeing here is that there's generally a lag. So we will see the negative impact from commodity and logistics sooner in our costs, then we do have the ability to pass that through for higher pricing.\n Now one thing that we did see, which turns this into somewhat of a positive, the last time we saw significant commodity and logistics headwinds, what we found is that the pricing is actually a little bit sticky upwards. So we actually look at this strategically as a way to get additional price. And then if the commodity and logistics headwinds abate at some point this year or even early next year, generally, the pricing that we see remains where it's at. There's always some give and take. But on the way up, that pricing opportunity is certainly going to be correlated with the headwinds we're seeing.\n And the other thing that I probably want to point out on this slide and remind folks is that this is versus prior guidance. So this is the overlay for additional commodity and logistics headwinds versus our beginning of the year assumptions. If you looked at this for a full year, we had about $20 million of headwinds for commodity and freight inflation in that beginning of the year guidance. So if you add the $20 million and the $25 million, you get about $45 million. We also had assumed about $15 million of pricing in that prior guidance as well. So full year pricing expectations are now right around $25 million. And if there is additional inflation, we do believe there's opportunity to take those pricing assumptions up as well. Yes. This is David, Steve. And I think everybody's had some time now to kind of put the Sudoku puzzle together and I'd say you did it correctly. So yes. The implication for margin is that there'd be about $35 million favorable year-over-year variance in the second half, and that offsets about $20 million unfavorable variance in the first half. So the reason you see favorability in the second half is because of the timing of some of these initiatives. We do assume that pricing will ramp up as we go through the year. So the $25 million in total, there's probably a relatively small number in the first quarter, and that will ramp up as we go through the year, in addition to our productivity opportunities. And a lot of those are around the purchasing side, completely independent from price. And though as well ramp up as we go through the year. So -- and almost sequentially. So Q4 is also significantly higher than what we're seeing in Q1. We do assume that what we're seeing today pretty much continues through the remainder of the year, probably with a little bit of a throttle down in the fourth quarter. We think it could obviously get worse. Steel is up 115% in Q1 this year versus last year. If you listen to the experts out there, a lot of that price was based on a ramp-up in demand and a slower response from the supply as they kind of ramp up mills. So I think everybody anticipates that it can't get much worse from a steel pricing perspective, which is our most exposed commodity. But I guess it could. But we feel pretty good with the provision we've included in the forecast as it relates to commodities, and we do assume it pretty much extends through the rest of the year. We -- there's 2 elements of mix we look at. We look at product mix, and we also look at regional mix. So certainly, we had a little bit of a headwind in Q1 from a regional perspective based on the significant growth in APAC year-over-year. That will update as we go through the year. But if you look at individual quarters, it likely is not going to be a significant player from a -- from a product perspective, we do believe that, I think in the first quarter, the critical infrastructure and solutions business was probably 50% of our total business last year. I think that ramped up closer to 60% in Q1. We don't see a similar dynamic through the remainder of the year, but as we're seeing, some of the additional sales we added to our guide are skewed a little bit more to that CI&S. So mix could be different each quarter, but we don't see it as significant as a headwind over the remainder of the year as we saw in the [Audio Gap]"

            "name": "Rob Johnson",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Thank you for your guidance that you provide to me and the executive team and the support for Vertiv that you always have given. We really appreciate it. \n To all of you on today's call, thank you for being here, and I'm eager to share more about our performance for the first quarter, our outlook for the market and give you a glimpse of a few new products Dave just talked about that our talented and innovative teams at Vertiv have developed. \n Turning to Slide 3. There are 5 key messages I want to convey today, and we'll share them at a high level, and David will elaborate more on the financial details in just a few minutes. First, I'm pleased to report sales were up more than 22%, and orders were up 21% versus Q1 of 2020. Growth happened in all regions across all major verticals, and we ended the quarter with a record high backlog of $2.1 billion. \n Second, from a profitability standpoint, our adjusted operating profit was $112 million, which is up $92 million or 450% from last year's first quarter. This resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of over 790 basis points, driven by higher sales and lower fixed cost on a percentage basis. \n Third, our free cash flow at the end of Q1 was $43 million, an improvement of $246 million, made possible by higher earnings and lower interest expense. \n Fourth, the market is facing supply chain and commodity cost challenges, and Vertiv is not exempt. We are aggressively working to secure supply needed so that we can provide on-time delivery to our customers, first and foremost, while developing and executing strategies to share the cost with our customers where possible. Because supply chain constraints, coupled with inflation, we will see some incremental unexpected costs over the short term. \n And fifth, and the final key message, we are raising our 2021 sales guidance by $125 million, such that the new sales guidance is between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion. And raising our adjusted operating profit guidance by $20 million. So our operating guidance is now $585 million to $605 million. \n This demonstrates our confidence in the end markets and the confidence in our teams all across Vertiv to perform in accordance with our strategy and to meet the growing needs of our customers. Let me elaborate on these 5 key points using the next few slides. \n Turning to Slide 4. We've been using this slide quarter-to-quarter to talk about our end markets and illustrate activity in each of our regions around the world. A red button on the slide indicates sluggish performance. A green bucket -- green button indicates strong performance. And a yellow button indicates something in between. Cloud and hyperscale and colocation markets have been very strong and remain strong across all regions. The demand for digital applications, online education, telemedicine, video and gaming is booming, benefiting our cloud and colocation customers and driving a strong and growing need for Vertiv products and services around the world. \n In our enterprise, small and medium business market, we're seeing signs of improvement as well. Our 2 reds have now turned yellow, but it's still not clear when the entire enterprise segment will open up. We are, however, encouraged to see things moving in the right direction. \n The communication networks market stayed constant in Americas and EMEA. It improved in APAC over the quarter, and we were able to see a shift in the market from yellow to green. Americas and APAC are performing strongly in this segment. Americas activity is driven by several large U.S. telecom carriers and the continued rollout of 5G. \n In the commercial and industrial market this quarter, EMEA has shifted from red to yellow. And because of that, we are now showing solid yellows across all regions, indicating some positive movement in the commercial and industrial space. \n All the end markets we serve are good -- are in very good shape now, as illustrated by the rays of yellows and green across the slide for Q1. \n Digital applications continue to increase their importance in everyday life. There's no -- they're no longer nice to have but a necessity for individuals and for businesses. The increasing need means there's an increasing demand for the processing, storage and transmission of data, which creates significant opportunity for Vertiv, and we are perfectly poised to go after that opportunity. \n Moving to Slide 5. I'd like to make a few comments regarding supply and demand. As I mentioned earlier, the overall market demand is strong, as evidenced by our order rates and backlog, which has resulted in us raising guidance. Each of our regions saw revenue growth in the first quarter, led by continued strength in cloud and colocation markets. Our cloud and colocation customers continue to build data centers in an aggressive but balanced fashion, and we will continue to partner with them to meet the strong and growing demand. \n We continue to stay vigilant around COVID, keeping our employees, our customers and our partners safe wherever they are in the world. That is our main priority. We have made adaptations where necessary and have found solutions to business challenges brought on by COVID. We remain confident in our ability to serve our customers and meet their needs. Yet, similar to other companies, we are facing some supply chain issues due to market conditions. \n There are a couple of things that are going on here. First, we find ourselves dealing with some parts shortages and materials. For the most part, we've identified solutions for those. Second, like many other companies, we are seeing cost increases on both material and the logistics side. This is being tracked and managed and closely monitored, and we are taking actions to offset the increased costs. \n But nonetheless, this is a short-term headwind. We've been planning to implement some footprint optimization programs. We have pivoted and decided to delay some of those programs to take advantage of the strong demand environment. The footprint optimization plan will be executed, but it will happen a little bit later than originally expected. \n Moving to Slide 6. I've talked to you in the past about our Vertiv product development process, VPD, and you all know about the allocations and resources we have made to research and development. So I wanted to show you a few of the new products. I can't tell you how thrilled I am with the progress that's being made in our engineering teams and all those that are responsible for executing our strategy to innovate, design and build products for the future. \n Here are some early results on this slide. The first product, shown in the upper left, will formally be launched tomorrow, and it's another way that we're helping our customers to become more efficient and provide lower carbon offerings. It is a grid interactive UPS, which will allow data center operators to use the UPS to power their data center and during low power times, to inject power back into the grid to drive the efficient use of data center equipment. \n On the upper right is the newest addition to our thermal offerings. We continue to innovate in the thermal space to drive more efficiencies and to provide best solutions for our customers. This product provides liquid cooling for high-density servers and racks, providing customers with an efficient way to cool their high-density applications. \n Finally, on the bottom of the chart, you will see 2 of our new edge offerings. The product on the lower left is a small UPS that's very efficient, very compact and utilizes the latest in lithium battery technology for longer time back -- for longer backup time. The product on the lower right is our newest single rack data center, which includes integrated UPS, power distribution, thermal management and our secure switch. This is a preconfigured solution and is a great example of the type of product we are bringing to the market for distributed IT and new edge applications. \n I really could talk hours about the research and development at Vertiv, but wanted to highlight a few of the new products so you can understand how we're focusing our R&D efforts and allowing us to bring these innovative solutions and offerings to our customers into the market. \n With that, I'll turn it over to David for a closer look at the Q1 numbers and come back at the end with some final comments. David? Well, thanks, David. Overall, I'm very proud of the Vertiv team and what we've accomplished since becoming public. We've been executing our strategy, as Dave Cote has alluded, whether it's the VOS or the product development, all the levers we've talked about, and we feel really good about the next 2, 3 years as we continue to execute that strategy. I believe our results for this quarter have demonstrated the hard work and the effort of the 20,000 employees we have around the world. \n As I look into the balance of 2021, we continue to anticipate above market top line growth and increase in profitability and a strengthening balance sheet, all while continuing to invest in the strategic areas, as we've talked about, R&D and sales and marketing. \n To all the employees on the call today, thank you again for your dedication and your tireless effort to take care of our customers. To all the investors, thank you for being on the call today and for your support over the past year. \n I'll now turn it over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions. Yes. Great question. And you're absolutely dead on with the colo and hyperscale. Typically, those don't fall into our flow rate business. So those orders come when they come. And we look them in the pipeline, but when they want to release them. And typically, we'll get those orders anywhere from 3, 6, 9 months in advance of deploying those. And what we've seen certainly is a tightening market and longer potential lead times. And I think as we look at the global build-out continue, it's just stronger than we necessarily expected and probably saw people making sure they get in line to get their supply going forward. \n So -- but I'm encouraged going forward, and you've seen -- I know a couple of others have released today, Google and Microsoft. And we're seeing strong and continue to see strong growth there on a global basis. So I'm positive to that. And as I mentioned earlier in the call or in my script I was going through, we are seeing signs of really good life in the enterprise. We'll see when that fully turns back on, and that could be additive as we watch that come back to life. Yes. Mark, this is Rob. I appreciate the question, and I'll start and then throw it over to David. But as we've talked about before in past calls, we do have an active funnel of potential companies that we think would make sense to be part of our portfolio. As Dave Cote has always said, opportunities and -- present themselves, not necessarily in timing, not when you want them to. And so we continue to work through that list and keep those type relationships and have eyes on things. \n As we've talked about before, it's always been about deleveraging first, and I think we've done a pretty good job doing that and have ourselves in a pretty good position to do some things if the opportunity positions itself. And we are actively -- always actively looking, but nothing that's imminent that we can talk about today. David? Well, listen, Amit, thanks for the question. And Gary and I will work this one together with you. But I would say, in general, the way we've looked at things is conservatively seeing enterprise come back online. Although I've been talking for a couple of quarters, the thing that gives me the comfort that it will is the quoting activity and the level of quotes. \n So I would say that as we see the enterprise turn from yellow to green, certainly, there's potentially some upside from that perspective. But I would say, in general, we continue to see the strength in the colo and the hyperscale. And as I mentioned in my comments, we think they're being very diligent about their build-outs as they go forward based on capacity needs that we see kind of around the globe. I don't know. Gary, any thoughts? Operator, we probably want to move to the next and see if Amit gets back in the queue. I think we lost him. Yes, we can hear you now. Welcome back. Yes, great question. First, I'll answer the last part of that and then get to the first. We have talked about in our strategy that we want to get to about 6% overall of -- for R&D. And so we've seen some ratchets up over the last couple of this year and last year and even next year to get to that 6%. And we plan on kind of holding it at that just based on the need, right? Really, what we're doing is taking a look at the funnel of projects, the collaboration that's needed by our customers, and doing what we need to do to really drive innovative solutions that will help us outpace the market growth and take share as we go forward. Certainly, there's not a lack of activities that we believe we can do to create more value for our customers and ultimately more value for the share owners. But as you think about it going forward, you think about it getting to about a 6% level, and we think that will be sufficient with the growth rate that we're going to have, which would give us additional R&D dollars every year, just holding it at 6%. Now David, any other thoughts? Nicole, you were cutting in and out a little bit. Is it possible to restate the question? Just -- we were getting every third word here. A little bit, yes. That's a great question, Nicole. We have, as we've talked about before, been able to get price the last year, couple of years. I think we're getting pretty good at doing that. When we've had times before where freight costs have gone up like they have been, we've been able to institute surcharges. Sometimes that's lagging, and I mentioned a few -- in some of my comments, some of the lagging to pick that up. And then based on contracts and orders, working with our customers, everyone understands that commodity prices are going up, steel is doubled, that type of thing. \n Our customers are pretty good about working with us and going through that. Certainly, we're able to go forward price things at that higher cost rate. And we're able to get that. So we feel good. We have $10 million, I think Dave showed in his bridge, of incremental additional pricing this year. While that's something we're striving for, we think we could probably do better than that. But based on what we see, based on where we're at, that's kind of what we built into our plan. But no, we've got a pretty good process now in our ability to drive prices through with our customers on a global scale. Well, I guess, yes, the way to kind of think about it, Scott, would be that during COVID period, people haven't been spending, and that equipment will. I can't give you an exact what the installed base would actually look like and what that ramp would be. What we are seeing early signs of is people upgrading their closets as they drive more to cloud and colo, upgrading their network closets, refurbishing old gear, certainly where there's old batteries and that type of thing. \n So certainly, when it goes to bright green, we would expect to see probably stronger than traditional growth in that enterprise because there's been -- and the reason I say that is we see the quoting activity. We see what's happening at the engineering side of things. And we do believe when that frees up, I don't know if it all happens overnight or it's a slow, kind of like we saw in this last quarter, slowly easing back into it. I mean I think a lot of it's going to be determined around what happens with the back to work with COVID vaccine, which we can't predict. But I think those things can be correlated and tied to people saying, I feel good about spending again. When people are back in the office, they're used to this level of service at home now. With the remote working, they're going to want to make sure that their gear in the office is where it needs to be. Great, Jeff, this is Rob. Yes, absolutely. So when we get -- where we are in the belief, the good interaction, we've actually had pilots going for months and even over a year over in Europe, where we'll do that kind of sharing model, revenue-sharing model with the utility where you'll go on battery and inject power back on the grid and/or just free up power for the grid. So there's a couple of different revenue-sharing models there. So as we get more sophisticated and people realize that, hey, it's still reliable infrastructure, even though you're on battery and people get more comfortable with that, we think that, that grid -- and in order to -- the grid interaction is going to play a big part of it. In order for people to drive more carbon friendly, they're going to have to be doing those types of things as well. So we see that and interacting with the grid, whether it's behind-the-meter storage or in front of the meter. And I talked about this before as an area, an adjacency and a growth area as we go forward.\n So as it relates to -- we'll continue to focus, as we've talked about in the past, thermal management requires -- draws most of the utility expense within a data center, and we continue to drive more efficient, effective solutions, utilizing software controls, AI around that. So we expect to see things like that in the future from us that will just drive that and helping that carbon get to that carbon neutral position. Lance, yes, we're really happy with the progress we're making with Honeywell on the collaboration. And that collaboration, we talked about a few different things. I think the first thing we talked about was kind of a software and controls thing to drive more efficiency, where we're piloting that. So we're more than just the planning phase. We've got some pilots. I think a bigger part of the collaboration is us working together globally and bringing Honeywell into areas that they necessarily haven't been into with their software offering, which is a very, very robust offering, along with our equipment and to drive more efficiency as we go through the data center. So we are -- the teams are working together globally and expect -- this isn't something that happens overnight, but expect over time, you'll see more and more of kind of the Honeywell-Vertiv solution showing up in data centers driving -- and really driving efficiency and then joint collaborating on customers they may have, but we aren't currently doing business with and vice versa. Yes. Andrew, Rob Johnson here. I really don't want to necessarily comment on what the competitors are going to do or not do. We -- consolidation sometimes gives an opportunity for companies like ours to be able to be in that top 2 or 3 bidding perspective. So they usually like to have 3 bidders. And so I see that as a potential positive for us as we go forward. We're really focused on our innovative solutions that we're bringing to market, our thermal management and kind of that total solutions approach in the channel, which we think globally, we've got a really good position and strong there. \n So while not necessarily focused on Tripp Lite and Eaton, what's going on there, we're really focused on bringing those new products to market and driving innovation against our competitors to gain share. And as you can see in our IRS business, we did have decent year-over-year growth. We've seen that for the last several quarters now and expect to continue to see that grow as we introduce more products into that venue. And not all IRS business is in the channel. So it's not necessarily indicative of the channel because we do sell -- the C&I business as well falls within that channel space. Andrew, thank you for your question. I don't think it really changes. We're a little bit different than maybe some of our competitive -- companies out there have always been kind of more or less an in country-for-country or an in region-for-region. What we did do over the last couple of years from an R&D perspective is really drive to a matrix and put center of excellence all over the world, not necessarily in best cost locations, but in the right place to be developing those products. So I think you'll find both our R&D investments, which are [ pulling full ] in the U.S. and in the Americas and in Europe and in Asia Pac, and I think you'll find that fairly balanced. And so we were already doing that.\n I think COVID has taught us a lesson about second sourcing vendors and making sure that we have more in region, and we've made some moves based on COVID to be even more regional from that perspective, which probably plays in the hands of some of the stuff Biden is doing. But in general, I don't think that's driving our thoughts right now. But I feel really comfortable with the footprint we have from a development perspective. And as we look at how we do things, we're, in some cases, a highly-engineered product, and freight and everything is important in speed to market is important. So being closer to our customers, not just using an Asian source and bringing that in, it has been part of our strategy and will continue to be that. Nigel, this is Rob. I'll start and then let Gary follow in. And one thing I think all of us on the call need to remember is, typically, people talk about a couple of the big 3 or 4, but as you look at the pie charts we've shared in the past, there's a lot of gray area, which is smaller, more regional players that play into this from that perspective. So you got to be careful just watching us versus some of the other competitors that are our size and really look at how we think about things, and part of our strategy was taking share from those more local mom and pop, where we failed to innovate early on or provide a solution and now can provide a solution and provide that globally.\n So I think we feel -- across the board, we feel really good about where we're at from a thermal position and from a power position as well. And again, you'll have some local players that we go up against, and then we'll go up with some of the global players. But overall, we -- with our strong growth that we've actually posted the last couple of years, we think we've been outpacing the industry, which would mean that we either get more of our fair share and taking some share from that perspective. But when you look at kind of a broader question, is there's a whole another 50% of the pie that's made up of a bunch of small mom-and-pops, pieces that are moving around. I don't know. Gary? Well, thank you, and I appreciate everyone attending our call today. As you can tell, we're really excited about the Q1 results, but really the go-forward and the execution of the strategy that we set out and shared with all of you, and we'll continue to drive that as we go forward. Again, I appreciate that support. Thank you, and have a great day."

And these process initiatives show that there are lots of barriers to improve upon, and Rob and the team are focused on those.

During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Well, 2022 was quite a year of transformation at Vertiv, a year focused on driving price, Americas improvement and progress on a high-performing culture. After a very disappointing 2021, we developed an ambitious plan to turn around the performance of the business over the next 4 quarters. Fourth quarter results demonstrated marked improvement consistent with the profit profile we shared last February. \n Our adjusted free cash flow performance, however, was not what it should have been largely because of working capital. We have consistently said the fourth quarter '22 performance will position us well for '23, and we believe that it has. We are increasing our view on 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance primarily due to foreign exchange, and that represents an over 75% increase year-over-year. And our adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to improve significantly because of higher income and less working capital usage. \n The demand environment continues to look good, and we're entering 2023 with significant backlog. Gio's focus on improved execution on everything is already apparent, and it certainly demonstrated in the improved performance in the Americas. I'm very excited about where the company is headed with Gio's leadership. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you, Dave. Thank you very much. I can certainly confirm that already in my initial days as CEO there has been a renewed focus on executional rigor and productivity, combined with the intensity that fosters a high-performance culture. And we are on Slide 3. 2022 was certainly a story of two halves, the first half painful when we did a lot of the hard work needed for acceleration and the second half strong with indeed a very strong fourth quarter, the strongest in our history. \n Fourth quarter organic sales were up 22%, driven by very robust growth in Americas and EMEA. Asia and China, in particular, was hindered by the impact of COVID, and we expect this impact to be short in nature. We extend -- we ended the year again with a record backlog of $4.8 billion, which firmly supports our top line growth projections for 2023. Adjusted operating profit of $211 million was a little short of the guidance range. This is mainly due to the approximately $40 million less volume in China. Closed by the COVID wave there. ENI performance was also weaker than expected due to some project cost overruns. These headwinds were partially offset by foreign exchange, although still negative, more favorable than assumed in our previous guidance provided in October. \n We are pleased by our pricing performance. We were on plan as we realized $135 million of price in the fourth quarter, and we delivered $365 million for the full year. We executed on the commitment we made early last year. There may have been some skeptics who discounted our ability to get price. That is understandable. I firmly believe that to deliver on commitments is the best way to respond to skepticism. And this is true in general. We demonstrated good sequential improvement in cash in the fourth quarter, but adjusted free cash flow was below expectations. \n There are reasons for the shortfall such as delayed collections in China, again, due to COVID and higher inventory due to some continued supply chain constraints because adjusted free cash flow is crucial we're instilling more rigor accountability and discipline in the whole process. David Fallon and I are keenly focused on this. Let's look at 2023. Our guidance a significant stat forward -- a significantly improved performance. Organic sales are expected to increase 15% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance, mainly because of foreign exchange, we are raising our AOP guidance from the $730 million to $750 million we announced in October to $750 million, $800 million now, over 75% increase year-over-year. \n We're guiding to $300 million to $400 million in adjusted free cash flow, supported by our plan of increased profit and working capital optimization. We will provide additional details around these plans as we make our way through the slides. Of course, we execute the a quarter at a time. It starts with good execution in the first quarter, and we have details on our first quarter guidance later in the slide presentation. Let's now turn to Slide 4, and let's spend a few minutes on the market. \n Only one change from the October view. We moved cloud hyperscale down from green to yellow in EMEA. This was driven by seeing some market signals that demand may be stabilizing, albeit at pretty high levels. Worth noting in general, cloud and hyperscale providers may swing a bit between building capacity in-house or outsourced to [indiscernible] providers. So after the two categories should be looked at together. Our Asian market views remain consistent with last quarter. We have operated in a quieter market environment in Asia for 2022. \n I've recently visited Asia and I have to say I'm pretty encouraged by what I saw and heard on the ground. For example, India is really just at the beginning of what looks to be a meaningful investment cycle. Americas is also consistent with the last quarter market view. Even though cloud hyperscale may be coming off their height over the last couple of years, they are still growing and investing at a healthy pace and one that supports our trajectory of business. \n We have discussed periods of digestion before. Certain customers are digesting their capacity. But this is a normal part of the cycle, and they typically digest at different times, which smooths the overall impact in the market. Additionally, spending is being directed to higher-density loads, such as artificial intelligence which demands more compute power and the need for additional infrastructure. We also believe that there is a normalization of orders that is happening as supply chains improved and lead times reduce. \n As this continues, customers are likely going to return to more normal order behavior. That is good for the industry overall but they make order comparatives look more negative than what is really happening in the market. We remain cautious on the enterprise. Now that what we're seeing a different dynamic unfolding since last quarter, but more so because we are mindful of the macro around us. We know this segment would typically be the first to reflect a possible recession in the U.S.A. or at least a period of economic slowdown. \n This happened in 2020 with economic slowdowns related to COVID-19. So we are staying vigilant. All in all, we remain cautiously optimistic on the market, driven by the continued need for data globally and favorable technology trends like artificial intelligence, requiring a higher density and more compute power. Now let's move to Slide 5. Customer demand still feels good. This is also confirmed by conversations with our customers around the world. Levels of investment and demand for our products and services continue to be healthy. We had signals -- we have signaled that fourth quarter year-on-year orders growth would be negative given a very strong comparison in the prior year, and that is what happened. \n As an example, 4Q '21, we experienced an order growth rate of more than 100% in Americas. We expect to see the same in 1Q 2023 with a tough comparison with the prior year. When orders were up 34% and now an environment where customers return to a more normalized pattern of ordering. So we expect Q1 orders to be down double digits. It is hard to provide precision on what double digits could look like as normalization of worded partners is still unfolding. We continue to have record high backlog and ended the year at $4.8 billion, which is a 49% increase from the end of 2021. \n This is inclusive of absorbing some order cancellations from a large hyperscale provider. This backlog represents over 70% coverage of the 2023 sales guidance, which is a much higher coverage ratio than we have seen in the past. This is reflective of an industry characterized by a very tight supply chain and still dealing with disruptions. We do think a normalization of the backlog at Vertiv and in the industry in general, is starting. And we expect this to continue as customers are seeing gradual improvement in supply chain and associated reduction in the time. \n We believe this process of normalization of the backlog will really be quite healthy for the overall market. We delivered on our pricing expectation, as previously mentioned. We continue to exercise the pricing muscle I referred to already on the 26th of October to price for the value we provide to our customers. Inflation. We still anticipate it to be a headwind in 2023, but we expect to have a net favorable price versus overall inflation impact of approximately $100 million, thanks to the actions and executional rigor we are fostering. \n Supply chain continues to incrementally improve, but still not without its challenges, especially in the power electronics area. We are moving from a wack-a-mole environment to one where we are in better control also thanks to the increased supply chain resiliency, our alternative component and supply efforts are enabling. And in summary, while we see some mixed signals in the macro, the long-term demand continues to be healthy for our business. We have a bit of wind in our back relative to price cost, supply chain is trending a bit better. And we started the year in a very strong backlog position. \n Visibility is still not great in a dynamic global environment but we are focused on what we can control. I like where we are starting the year. Our fourth quarter performance sets up well for a successful 2023 despite navigating what could be a more challenging macro environment. We are strengthening and I'd like to repeat this, the operating models and executional rigor in general and certainly around everything cash flow. So with that, over to David to walk us through the financials. David? \nDavid Fallon: Perfect. Thanks, Gio. First, turning to Slide 6. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results. Although fourth quarter results were lower than our expectations, looking at this slide holistically, you can appreciate the marked improvement from a year ago. As both Dave and Gio mentioned, there is still work to do, but fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $211 million, was not only a record high, but a record high by about 40%. \n Going forward, it's our aim for every quarter to be a record quarter. And we are certainly better positioned today to deliver those types of results in large part due to what we have gone through over the last 18 months or so. With that said, let's look at the fourth quarter detail. Net sales increased 17% from last year's fourth quarter and were up 22% organically. This organic growth included 12% from volume and 10% from pricing while still comfortably within our guidance range for sales versus expectations, sales were negatively impacted by approximately $40 million from the COVID wave in China which significantly limited our production in the final 2 months of the year. \n Lower sales in China were partially offset by a $30 million foreign exchange tailwind versus beginning of quarter expectations as the Euro, RMB and British pound all strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Adjusted operating profit of $211 million was below our guidance range and this was primarily due to lower-than-anticipated volume in China, which should just be timing and weaker-than-expected results from E&I. Looking at the macro puts and takes, we realized a $135 million pricing benefit in the quarter, which was consistent with our beginning of quarter guidance. And pricing was partially offset by a $55 million headwind from material and freight inflation once again also consistent with our guidance. \n As a result, we were $80 million price cost positive in the fourth quarter and $60 million positive for the full year. $165 million higher sales volume contributed $50 million higher adjusted operating profit, and foreign exchange, although favorable versus expectation was still a $15 million headwind versus prior year. Fourth quarter E&I performance was below our expectations, and this was driven by cost overruns on several large projects and unfavorable mix. \n The project cost overruns were driven by execution challenges and a lack of visibility on costs, largely focused within a single manufacturing plant and both issues are very much fixable and are being addressed as we continue to integrate E&I in the Vertiv processes and systems. While certainly a challenging quarter and quite frankly, a challenging year for E&I, we are still extremely excited about this acquisition. There is likely more tactical work to be done than we originally anticipated. But as we mentioned previously, on the last call, the potential for sales synergies is much higher than we originally modeled as evidenced by the near 150% E&I backlog growth during 2022. \n To support this higher volume, we are actively investing in capacity expansions at existing Vertiv facilities in Mexico and Slovakia as we continue to push E&I products through legacy vert of sales channels. And finally, on this slide, we generated $143 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter, and that was $135 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. Although a strong year-over-year comparison, adjusted free cash flow was significantly below our guidance range driven by several factors, including delayed collections in China from the impact of COVID, higher-than-expected inventory as we continue to manage supply chain constraints, while managing a record high volume and also delayed receipt of advanced payments for several large orders, which were pushed into and likely spread throughout 2023. \n Although fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was short of expectations, we continue to make progress in stemming the tide. We burned $380 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first half of the year while we generated $150 million in the second half, we certainly were not alone in managing the challenges of inventory in 2022. But unsurprisingly, we saw a similar pattern with inventory, which grew $180 million in the first half, but just $30 million in the second half. There is still much work to do. But as Dave and Gio both mentioned, optimizing working capital will be a significant focus for 2023 for Gio, for myself and quite frankly, the entire company. \n We believe we strengthened the P&L in 2022. And now we will work diligently to strengthen the balance sheet. Next, turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment -- fourth quarter segment results with strong organic sales growth in each of the Americas and EMEA. APAC organic sales were relatively flat, primarily due to COVID. Otherwise, organic sales would have been up about 9%. Americas 40% organic growth. You need to say that again, organic growth was supported by 26% volume growth and 14% pricing. \n And each of these is an impressive number in and of its own. The volume growth was supported by launching additional thermal capacity in Monterrey, while also proactively addressing several supply chain issues, including the qualification of new suppliers. From an adjusted operating margin perspective, all regions were up significantly from last year's fourth quarter. And for the first time, all regions were price/cost positive. Americas improvement was the most pronounced as they were the first region last year to be hit by inflation against an underpriced backlog. \n They were approximately $60 million price/cost positive in the quarter which demonstrates the significance of the aggressive pricing program put in place at the start of the year. Both the Americas and EMEA adjusted operating margin were above 20% for the quarter, but APAC was not that far behind. Next, turning to Slide 8. We added this slide to highlight the turnaround specifically in the Americas region in 2022. Under Gio's leadership, we saw significant sequential quarterly improvement as that business focused on getting the fundamentals right, improving processes, while also holding people accountable by emphasizing a high-performance culture. \n It's still early innings and still work to do, but we are pleased yet not satisfied with the progress to date. Gio borrowed best practices from EMEA and institutionalize those in the Americas. And as this slide demonstrates, we are certainly seeing the results. Of course, and as a reminder, the Americas region, adjusted operating margin just a couple of years ago was in the mid-20s. So there is still certainly room for significant upside in the Americas and, quite frankly, in all regions in 2023 and beyond. \n Next, turning to Slide 9. This slide summarizes our full year results. We developed an aggressive framework to transform the business at the beginning of the year, and we made significant progress. And we'll touch upon that in the next slide. But it really was a story of two halves with each financial metric. Sales were up organically 4% in the first half, but over 20% in the second half. Adjusted operating profit was up -- or was $95 million in the first half, but $345 million in the second half. Adjusted operating margin was 3.7% first half 11% second half. Adjusted free cash flow was a burn of $380 million in the first half, but a generation of $120 million in the second half. \n So although full year results are critically important, the underlying dynamics of the cadence of our improvements through the year are likely more pertinent to understand the Vertiv turnaround story which we capture on the next slide, Slide 10. \n And this slide nicely captures the turnaround executed in 2022. While there were puts and takes along the way, we execute it relatively consistent with the profile we presented in February and delivered sequentially improving performance each quarter improving adjusted operating profit by almost $200 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. And of course, our fourth quarter performance is not an end in and of itself, but it serves as a strong foundation for continued improving results in 2023 and well beyond which serves as a good segue, so moving from the rearview mirror to the road ahead, let's turn to Slide 12, which summarizes our full year 2023 guidance. \n We anticipate 2023 sales increasing 15% at the midpoint with approximately 10% from volume and 5% from pricing, of which a significant portion is carryover or based upon enacted price increases. Markets currently remain healthy, and we have a record backlog of $4.8 billion coming into the year. Despite the recent strengthening of the euro, RMB and British pound against the U.S. dollar, we do anticipate a full year foreign exchange headwind of approximately $40 million, and that includes a $70 million headwind in the first half partially offset by a $30 million tailwind in the back half. \n We have raised our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance range to $750 million to $800 million and that's up from the $730 million to $750 million range previously. And this change is primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currency from the end of October when we provided that previous guidance. The midpoint of our revised guidance range represents an over 75% increase year-over-year which is certainly significant. And we include a bridge on Slide 31 in the appendix that summarizes the drivers of this increase. And Gio will touch upon some of the dynamics in a couple of pages. But big picture, it is driven by higher sales, supported by our record backlog and additional pricing, much of which is carryover. \n These tailwinds are offset by an assumed $175 million of inflation. And this includes labor. About $75 million of labor inflation is included in that $175 million. And also a $40 million combined investment in R&D and additional capacity to support higher expected sales in 2023 and beyond. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 represents a 2x increase from 2022, and that's mainly driven by the improved adjusted operating profit. Adjusted free cash flow guidance of $300 million to $400 million is primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and optimized working capital, which, as we mentioned, will be a significant focus going forward. \n Gio will provide some of the additional color on working capital initiatives in a couple of slides. And please refer to Slides 31 and 33 in the appendix for additional detail on core assumptions supporting our '23 guidance. Next, Slide 13. This includes a summary of our first quarter financial guidance. And our first quarter certainly showed significant year-over-year improvement across all financial measures. Although we realize it's against a relatively easy comparison to a weak prior year first quarter. That said, our first quarter guidance continues the trajectory of improvement building off a strong fourth quarter. \n However, as a reminder, seasonality in our business generally results in our first quarter being the lowest quarter and our fourth quarter being the highest. So in general, like 2022, sequentially improving quarterly financial performance across each of these financial measures in 2023 is the expectation. First quarter net sales are expected to be up 21%, 25% organically, driven by higher volume and pricing benefits, partially offset by a foreign exchange headwind. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be $125 million at the midpoint with pricing, volume and productivity offset by inflation and growth investments. \n Adjusted EPS improvement is coming primarily from higher adjusted operating profit. Adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be a use of cash of between $50 million and $100 million. Approximately $75 million better than last year's first quarter despite year-over-year headwinds of $20 million from cash interest due to higher interest rates and simply from the timing of payroll. Like many industrials, our first quarter typically drives the use of cash, and we anticipate generating adjusted free cash flow for each of the remaining quarters in 2023. With that said, I turn it back over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you, David. Thank you very much, and we turn to Slide 14. We know that this guidance may look aggressive to some. It may as well look conservative to others. But I want you to share some points that supports our assumptions about our guidance. I'll start with adjusted operating profit. And let's look at the volume assumptions. We are at the highest backlog coverage point in our history over 30%. Additionally, there is always a lot more book and ship time and materials, services, spare parts, flow business. Parts of the business that transact on a very short cycle and provide additional volume on the year. Our Q4 book-to-bill ratio was 115% and high levels that have characterized the entire 2022. Obviously, some moderation in our book-to-bill ratio is expected going into 2023 as customers return to a more normalized, as I said, order pattern. \n This supply environment has been improving, and this should lead to a decrease in our need to do spot buys. We believe we have conservative estimates for inflation. We have a pricing plan that is largely already in backlog or based on actions that have already been taken and we have demonstrated our ability to get price. Let's look at the cash flow now. You have heard all of us speak directly about adjusted free cash flow. We know we did not execute well in this metric in 2022. Certainly, the improved adjusted operating profit starts off at a very different point for 2023. We have reasonable assumptions for elements that typically do not vary too much like interest back CapEx and we have strong working capital initiatives. \n This is a top priority for the organization, and we are managing this very closely. I would reference how we approached price last year. It was all hands on deck, rigor around the process accountability and focus on execution. And we executed well. The same rigor is around executing the working capital initiatives and the adjusted free cash flow generation. Let's now turn to Slide 15. Our focus areas for 2023 are clear, clear reflection of our priorities. \n We won the entire team pulling in the same direction. We are working on the culture fostering a high-performance culture where we do what we say, where ownership is clear where we hold ourselves accountable for delivering the results and we reward performance. Culture doesn't change overnight. It is a process. But as we strengthen our focus, we have seen signs that the high-performance culture is starting to take hold and we see that through improved financial results. I've been visiting many parts of the organization lately, including China, India, Mexico, Slovakia, Ireland, the Middle East. I have met many people at all levels. And I'm very encouraged by what I see. People who love and care for what they do and care for the company. We have a lot to do, but I feel the energy of the organization. Again, pricing, supply chain resiliency and trade working capital optimization are primary focus areas, and we will continue to build those muscles, continue to institutionalize this in the organization. \n This is what high-performing companies do. We still have great potential to operate in a more efficient and effective way across the company. There is no magic wand. It's constant focus on the things that matter and strong operational execution, rigorous, relentless, pragmatic execution at all levels and starting from the top. I am encouraged by finish to 2022. The year was certainly not profit but are signs of real progress permeating throughout the organization and most importantly, showing up in our financial results. \n Dave started off the call today by indicating 2022 was a year of transformation assertive. I wholeheartedly agree, and it is just the beginning. With that said, we will now turn the call over to the operator, who will open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question we have from the phone line comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. \nScott Davis: I really just have one main question, and it's just related to the order cancellation of the hyperscale customer. Could you give us a little bit more color around that? And is it your experience that these things tend to be one-offs. I mean I would think that if one customer is canceling it could be kind of a start of a trend, if you will, I'm not trying to be paranoid here, just. A little bit color there, I think, would be helpful. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Scott, we know that paranoia is always very healthy. We try to exercise paranoia in everything, and everything we do when it comes to running the business almost religiously. This is Gio. But obviously, we're not able to share customer-specific information. But I would say it is not unusual sometimes that there are some reconfigurations in terms of what customers decide to do with their infrastructure. Having said that, of course, being paranoid, we keep an extremely sharp eye on our orders dynamics. Other now what we have signals -- we signaled, we have noticed -- we have not noticed anything extraordinary, let's say, in the dynamics. So we will continue to be -- to exercise extreme focus there, but nothing extraordinary. \nScott Davis: Okay. And just as a natural follow-up, I mean you've had a quarter now of kind of order normalization. Historically, does that typically last 2 to 3 quarters? Or is it something that is a little quicker than that? \nGiordano Albertazzi: It is -- it's hard to refer to history here because I do not think that I've been in the industry, as you know, for quite some time. I have never seen anything like what has happened in the industry in the last 1.5 years, 2 years. The magnitude of the combination of lengthening lead times and demand growth has driven a let's say, desire to cover longer and longer demand periods of our customers. That is absolutely unprecedented. All in general, not just Vertex customers in the industry in general. So being able to say how that will undo or normalize, it's very, very hard. \n But our expectation is that it will probably take 6 months. But hey, this is a guess. We'll keep our eyes open and try to understand how it exactly unfolds. And I'll probably be able to tell better in it. \nScott Davis: That's very helpful. Okay. Best of luck this year. I'll pass it on. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: Just David, going back to the raise guide for '23. You mentioned FX which makes total sense, of course, with the dollar movements. But then you mentioned E&I as a timing issue, the larger timing issue. Are you assuming that sort of the lost EBIT at E&I comes through into '23. Any help in terms of the path of recovery there would be helpful. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I wouldn't necessarily call the E&I issue from the fourth quarter, a timing issue. We were referring more to the sales timing for China related to COVID. All those sales were based on orders that we have in hand and no guarantee we'll make that up in Q1, but that's certainly just a timing. As it relates to E&I, there, we certainly expect improvement in 2023 versus what we saw in 2022. I think full year adjusted operating profit for E&I was between $50 million and $55 million. We anticipated $80 million at the beginning of this year, and we certainly would anticipate something north of $80 million for full year 2023. \nNigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then I think if you look at your 1Q sales guide, I think 21%, 22% of your midpoint sales coming through in 1Q as a portion of the full year. That's actually the highest proportion we've seen since Vertiv as a public company going back to 2018. So obviously, we like front-end loaded guidances, but does that indicate sort of inherent in it in the way you built up the plan? Or does it indicate some of the expectation of the slowing in the back half of the year relative to norms? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. That's a good question. I would say -- if you look at the risk from a sales perspective in our plan for 2023 and very consistent with what we said at the end of the third quarter. It's not going to necessarily be backlog, but it will be related to the availability of supply. And in particular, we have continuing challenges with power semiconductors and electronic components. \n So there may be a bit of a hedge in the back half of the year because we don't have great visibility in that market, similar to everybody who is trying to get their hands on those power semiconductors. In addition, there is still a healthy amount of book and ship that is out there for the back half of the year, and we'll have better visibility into that at the end of the first quarter and probably much better at the end of the first half. \nNigel Coe: So just to be clear, you still expect there to be supply constraints in the back half of the year? \nDavid Fallon: Specifically as it relates to electronic components and Gio can speak to the supply environment. But one of our objectives on this call is to make it clear that we're not through the supply chain issues, right? And I would say many components we purchase are much better than they were 3 months ago, 6 months ago. But there are certainly still challenges on very critical components that we have to procure across our entire product line, whether that's AC power or thermal. \n One, in particular, is the power semiconductors. And there's long lead times there, and we don't have great visibility. We do anticipate that improving as we go through the year. But our visibility there probably is a matter of quarters, not a matter of -- looking out what a year is going to potentially look like? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes, I can comment further. Thank you, David, Nigel. So we have on the supply side of things to aspects at the same time in parallel. One is us getting, of course, stronger, more robust. As we explained, we have strengthened our SIOP Processes. We have made our supply network and supply base more resilient with multi-sourced components and also supplies. But at the same time, the market, albeit improving is certainly not normalizing that is at the same time on the supply side, especially as Dave was saying, everything that has to do with the power semiconductors. \n But the power semiconductors are present in this lot of things -- a lot of the components we use. They're not just as such, but components in the components we purchase. So we believe we are stronger. We believe we have figured a lot of things out during the course of 2022. But by all means, the message is not that everything is perfect out there. And it's still a complicated market, but we're much better equipped to navigate in that market. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Can you talk about maybe some of the levers on cash into '24 and kind of where normalized free cash would land for you guys in the next couple of years? Or not normalized, but where you think you can get to on that number beyond this year? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. This is David. So if you look at our guide, for '23. And we break down the components, I think, Page 33 in the appendix. So you can see how it kind of built up the most important, certainly, you got to start with adjusted EBITDA. And that certainly there'd be an expectation for that debt to flow through if that's higher or lower than what we're targeting. Putting working capital aside, the other three components, as Gio mentioned, there's some probability of variability there, but I wouldn't say significant. \n Certainly, if we're more profitable, we'll pay more taxes. That's just kind of how it works. But fairly certain that we would -- our CapEx number will come in within a range of what's reasonable with what we guided. And then interest, we're definitely subject to movement in interest rates. But if we have significant upside or slight downside, it more than likely isn't going to be related to those three components. It's going to be the working capital component. And if you look at the $75 million use for full year 2023, we certainly assume success in some of the working capital initiatives that Gio mentioned. \n Working capital in and of itself will be a headwind due to the 15% organic growth, right? That's just how it works. But with that said, it's not hundreds of millions of dollars. It's not a $300 million or $400 million headwind, and we're expecting very significant or including in our guidance, very significant working capital initiative benefits. So that headwind could be $1 million or $200 million, you can do the math. And that's based on what we think sales are going to be in the fourth quarter of '23 versus the fourth quarter of 2022. So we have some provision in these numbers for success with optimizing working capital, but it could end up being a conservative assumption. \n There's still a lot of complications. The supply chain is not back to stable. So there's a lot of challenges in front of us, but we're confident with this guidance we have provided. But if you look at the $350 million versus, if you will, an adjusted net income for the full year, it's probably 75%, 80%. We would target in the long run, being in the 90%-plus range. It's always hard for an industrial company to get to 100% of free cash flow conversion if the expectation is to grow 10% to 15% a year. \n With that said, we believe this is a reasonable guide between the $300 million and $400 million, but is definitely room for upside if we're able to execute some of our working capital initiatives quicker than what's assumed in the guidance. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Right. So the short answer to that is 90%. You view as being normalized, 90% of that income. \nDavid Fallon: That would be the long-term goal. Yes. 90% of adjusted net income. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Can you get there in, do you think '24? \nDavid Fallon: I believe we can. And it -- if you look at our issues, they're all very fixable, right? Inventory increased this year, that was probably up $250 million. It was definitely somewhat of a chaotic environment, but we have a game plan for this year. \n And that also goes for many of the components of working capital. So AR, we had some complex larger orders that we had to process in 2022 with multiple deliverables, very tactical issues that we can address. So I feel fairly confident we can get to that 90% number in '24 and go forward. But let us get through 2023 first, and then we'll provide some insight on what we think the timing would be for that number going forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: Wanted to just pick up where Steve left off, just thinking about the actual process of deleveraging here and if there's any leakage in the equation? I know there's always noise at year-end, but it looks to me like net debt only declined by about 1/3 of what the free cash flow was in the quarter. So there's like other uses somewhere, which I haven't figured out and that time today to try to sort that out. \n But if you do $350 million of free cash flow in 2023, can we expect something in the neighborhood of deleveraging net cash -- net debt improvement kind of in that range? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So the significant use outside of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, Jeff, was related to the tax receivable agreement. There was a $75 million payment in the fourth quarter which takes that off our books completely. If you look at the leverage, if you look at the math at year-end, and you look at a trailing 12-month EBITDA number, I think our net debt leverage is about 5.6%, which certainly is much higher than we would like. \n But if you look at that same ratio looking at a forward-looking EBITDA number, meaning the approximately $865 million of EBITDA anticipated for '23. It's about 3.5x levered. And then if you assume the $350 million of expected free cash flow is used to delever, whether sitting in cash on the balance sheet or to pay down debt. The net leverage gets down to 3x. So if we execute upon our plan in 2023 there's a relatively quick path to that deleveraging. And our long-term goal is to keep leverage between 2x and 3x that we're willing to go either below or above that range for specific reasons. But in general, if we execute what we have on paper here in '23, we should be closer to 3x levered as we exit '23. \nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And then just back to just kind of business conditions. Back on Slide 5, just to comment that the pricing environment remains favorable in many of our product segments sort of implies it's not favorable and others. Could you just maybe talk about the tenor of price on new incoming orders? And where there might be softness if you're implying there is some softness in that statement. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, there are two different dynamics at play. One, what I mentioned as our pricing muscle so an ability to better price for the value that we deliver. We deliver to our customers. So that's something that will always be there. and something that we did not have at least not with the efficacy that we have now in the past. So that stays I think that shouldn't read the phrase on the negative side. The message is despite an environment in which we see on the cost side in general, a moderating inflation, but inflation nonetheless, we still see that in many parts of our business, we still can continue to work the price lever. And that's what we're doing. \n When it comes to 2023, in particular, a big chunk of our price is already in backlog. And that price in our backlog of course is very important for us to deliver on our guidance. But also the price that is not yet in the backlog is a price that we see being realized with the orders that we are in taking. But expect over time a normalization also in terms of price. And when that happens, and it is not necessarily now in the market because, again, the inflationary trends are still there. When that happens, we are better equipped with an ability to price for value. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Lance Vitanza of Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: I had two questions, if I could. The first is actually back on Slide 4, the market environment. And I was hoping you could drill down a little bit more on the EMEA, which -- cloud hyperscale which moved from green to yellow and Gio, could you talk a little bit more about what's driving that change? And is it linked to fears around an economic contraction? Or has that market just become somewhat saturated? And -- and then I guess, is the next move? Do we think is it more likely to be a move from yellow to red, or do we think it's more likely to move back to green? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, as I was saying, it's -- we can have a very sharp eye on all the signals in this moment in which the order dynamics are very dynamic. As we explained during the -- as we were going through the deck, we have no signals in this moment that would tell us in this moment. I would tell us that there is red looming behind the colors that you see here. But again, well, we keep our eyes wide open in case of something changes. When it comes to the EMEA, we see it more of a change of mix between cloud [indiscernible] and colocation, as I mentioned, in one of our -- in my comments earlier. \n And again, simply a change of mix between what the hyperscalers and cloud providers build for their own direct infrastructure vis-a-vis what they leave and the color may flip. I would not read dramatically into that. Just saying, hey, EMEA is going through the same type of order normalization that I've signaled and mentioned already, and we'll see how that plays out. \nLance Vitanza: Okay. And then just lastly for me. You mentioned -- actually, I think it was David who mentioned that with E&I that there might be a need for some more tactical work there. I was wondering if you could flesh that out a bit. And then with respect to the backlog, I think you said the backlog was up like 100-plus percent. And wondering if you could break that out a bit in terms of U.S. versus EMEA versus Asia Pacific. \nGiordano Albertazzi: So we may not have time to go into the details by region here when it comes to the backlog. But I must say that we are very, very happy about the sales leverage that we are obtaining, expanding the -- adding the E&I portfolio to the broader Vertiv go-to-market. And indeed, if you will, we've been also quite surprised by how strong the market reaction has been. So with that, as David was mentioning, we are expanding capacity. \n We are expanding capacity quite vigorously specifically for E&I. The rest is about accelerating the integration, making sure that the same rigorous executional approach that we are instigating for Vertiv as a whole is applicable to E&I and continue to drive price. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Giordano Albertazzi as for any closing remarks. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you. Thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I really appreciate the support and very much looking forward to reporting out on our Q1 2023 progress. So stay tuned. And again, a big thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending this presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Perfect. Thanks, Gio. First, turning to Slide 6. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results. Although fourth quarter results were lower than our expectations, looking at this slide holistically, you can appreciate the marked improvement from a year ago. As both Dave and Gio mentioned, there is still work to do, but fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $211 million, was not only a record high, but a record high by about 40%. \n Going forward, it's our aim for every quarter to be a record quarter. And we are certainly better positioned today to deliver those types of results in large part due to what we have gone through over the last 18 months or so. With that said, let's look at the fourth quarter detail. Net sales increased 17% from last year's fourth quarter and were up 22% organically. This organic growth included 12% from volume and 10% from pricing while still comfortably within our guidance range for sales versus expectations, sales were negatively impacted by approximately $40 million from the COVID wave in China which significantly limited our production in the final 2 months of the year. \n Lower sales in China were partially offset by a $30 million foreign exchange tailwind versus beginning of quarter expectations as the Euro, RMB and British pound all strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Adjusted operating profit of $211 million was below our guidance range and this was primarily due to lower-than-anticipated volume in China, which should just be timing and weaker-than-expected results from E&I. Looking at the macro puts and takes, we realized a $135 million pricing benefit in the quarter, which was consistent with our beginning of quarter guidance. And pricing was partially offset by a $55 million headwind from material and freight inflation once again also consistent with our guidance. \n As a result, we were $80 million price cost positive in the fourth quarter and $60 million positive for the full year. $165 million higher sales volume contributed $50 million higher adjusted operating profit, and foreign exchange, although favorable versus expectation was still a $15 million headwind versus prior year. Fourth quarter E&I performance was below our expectations, and this was driven by cost overruns on several large projects and unfavorable mix. \n The project cost overruns were driven by execution challenges and a lack of visibility on costs, largely focused within a single manufacturing plant and both issues are very much fixable and are being addressed as we continue to integrate E&I in the Vertiv processes and systems. While certainly a challenging quarter and quite frankly, a challenging year for E&I, we are still extremely excited about this acquisition. There is likely more tactical work to be done than we originally anticipated. But as we mentioned previously, on the last call, the potential for sales synergies is much higher than we originally modeled as evidenced by the near 150% E&I backlog growth during 2022. \n To support this higher volume, we are actively investing in capacity expansions at existing Vertiv facilities in Mexico and Slovakia as we continue to push E&I products through legacy vert of sales channels. And finally, on this slide, we generated $143 million of adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter, and that was $135 million higher than last year's fourth quarter. Although a strong year-over-year comparison, adjusted free cash flow was significantly below our guidance range driven by several factors, including delayed collections in China from the impact of COVID, higher-than-expected inventory as we continue to manage supply chain constraints, while managing a record high volume and also delayed receipt of advanced payments for several large orders, which were pushed into and likely spread throughout 2023. \n Although fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was short of expectations, we continue to make progress in stemming the tide. We burned $380 million of adjusted free cash flow in the first half of the year while we generated $150 million in the second half, we certainly were not alone in managing the challenges of inventory in 2022. But unsurprisingly, we saw a similar pattern with inventory, which grew $180 million in the first half, but just $30 million in the second half. There is still much work to do. But as Dave and Gio both mentioned, optimizing working capital will be a significant focus for 2023 for Gio, for myself and quite frankly, the entire company. \n We believe we strengthened the P&L in 2022. And now we will work diligently to strengthen the balance sheet. Next, turning to Slide 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment -- fourth quarter segment results with strong organic sales growth in each of the Americas and EMEA. APAC organic sales were relatively flat, primarily due to COVID. Otherwise, organic sales would have been up about 9%. Americas 40% organic growth. You need to say that again, organic growth was supported by 26% volume growth and 14% pricing. \n And each of these is an impressive number in and of its own. The volume growth was supported by launching additional thermal capacity in Monterrey, while also proactively addressing several supply chain issues, including the qualification of new suppliers. From an adjusted operating margin perspective, all regions were up significantly from last year's fourth quarter. And for the first time, all regions were price/cost positive. Americas improvement was the most pronounced as they were the first region last year to be hit by inflation against an underpriced backlog. \n They were approximately $60 million price/cost positive in the quarter which demonstrates the significance of the aggressive pricing program put in place at the start of the year. Both the Americas and EMEA adjusted operating margin were above 20% for the quarter, but APAC was not that far behind. Next, turning to Slide 8. We added this slide to highlight the turnaround specifically in the Americas region in 2022. Under Gio's leadership, we saw significant sequential quarterly improvement as that business focused on getting the fundamentals right, improving processes, while also holding people accountable by emphasizing a high-performance culture. \n It's still early innings and still work to do, but we are pleased yet not satisfied with the progress to date. Gio borrowed best practices from EMEA and institutionalize those in the Americas. And as this slide demonstrates, we are certainly seeing the results. Of course, and as a reminder, the Americas region, adjusted operating margin just a couple of years ago was in the mid-20s. So there is still certainly room for significant upside in the Americas and, quite frankly, in all regions in 2023 and beyond. \n Next, turning to Slide 9. This slide summarizes our full year results. We developed an aggressive framework to transform the business at the beginning of the year, and we made significant progress. And we'll touch upon that in the next slide. But it really was a story of two halves with each financial metric. Sales were up organically 4% in the first half, but over 20% in the second half. Adjusted operating profit was up -- or was $95 million in the first half, but $345 million in the second half. Adjusted operating margin was 3.7% first half 11% second half. Adjusted free cash flow was a burn of $380 million in the first half, but a generation of $120 million in the second half. \n So although full year results are critically important, the underlying dynamics of the cadence of our improvements through the year are likely more pertinent to understand the Vertiv turnaround story which we capture on the next slide, Slide 10. \n And this slide nicely captures the turnaround executed in 2022. While there were puts and takes along the way, we execute it relatively consistent with the profile we presented in February and delivered sequentially improving performance each quarter improving adjusted operating profit by almost $200 million from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. And of course, our fourth quarter performance is not an end in and of itself, but it serves as a strong foundation for continued improving results in 2023 and well beyond which serves as a good segue, so moving from the rearview mirror to the road ahead, let's turn to Slide 12, which summarizes our full year 2023 guidance. \n We anticipate 2023 sales increasing 15% at the midpoint with approximately 10% from volume and 5% from pricing, of which a significant portion is carryover or based upon enacted price increases. Markets currently remain healthy, and we have a record backlog of $4.8 billion coming into the year. Despite the recent strengthening of the euro, RMB and British pound against the U.S. dollar, we do anticipate a full year foreign exchange headwind of approximately $40 million, and that includes a $70 million headwind in the first half partially offset by a $30 million tailwind in the back half. \n We have raised our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance range to $750 million to $800 million and that's up from the $730 million to $750 million range previously. And this change is primarily due to the strengthening of foreign currency from the end of October when we provided that previous guidance. The midpoint of our revised guidance range represents an over 75% increase year-over-year which is certainly significant. And we include a bridge on Slide 31 in the appendix that summarizes the drivers of this increase. And Gio will touch upon some of the dynamics in a couple of pages. But big picture, it is driven by higher sales, supported by our record backlog and additional pricing, much of which is carryover. \n These tailwinds are offset by an assumed $175 million of inflation. And this includes labor. About $75 million of labor inflation is included in that $175 million. And also a $40 million combined investment in R&D and additional capacity to support higher expected sales in 2023 and beyond. Adjusted EPS of $1.22 represents a 2x increase from 2022, and that's mainly driven by the improved adjusted operating profit. Adjusted free cash flow guidance of $300 million to $400 million is primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and optimized working capital, which, as we mentioned, will be a significant focus going forward. \n Gio will provide some of the additional color on working capital initiatives in a couple of slides. And please refer to Slides 31 and 33 in the appendix for additional detail on core assumptions supporting our '23 guidance. Next, Slide 13. This includes a summary of our first quarter financial guidance. And our first quarter certainly showed significant year-over-year improvement across all financial measures. Although we realize it's against a relatively easy comparison to a weak prior year first quarter. That said, our first quarter guidance continues the trajectory of improvement building off a strong fourth quarter. \n However, as a reminder, seasonality in our business generally results in our first quarter being the lowest quarter and our fourth quarter being the highest. So in general, like 2022, sequentially improving quarterly financial performance across each of these financial measures in 2023 is the expectation. First quarter net sales are expected to be up 21%, 25% organically, driven by higher volume and pricing benefits, partially offset by a foreign exchange headwind. Adjusted operating profit is expected to be $125 million at the midpoint with pricing, volume and productivity offset by inflation and growth investments. \n Adjusted EPS improvement is coming primarily from higher adjusted operating profit. Adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to be a use of cash of between $50 million and $100 million. Approximately $75 million better than last year's first quarter despite year-over-year headwinds of $20 million from cash interest due to higher interest rates and simply from the timing of payroll. Like many industrials, our first quarter typically drives the use of cash, and we anticipate generating adjusted free cash flow for each of the remaining quarters in 2023. With that said, I turn it back over to Gio. Yes. I wouldn't necessarily call the E&I issue from the fourth quarter, a timing issue. We were referring more to the sales timing for China related to COVID. All those sales were based on orders that we have in hand and no guarantee we'll make that up in Q1, but that's certainly just a timing. As it relates to E&I, there, we certainly expect improvement in 2023 versus what we saw in 2022. I think full year adjusted operating profit for E&I was between $50 million and $55 million. We anticipated $80 million at the beginning of this year, and we certainly would anticipate something north of $80 million for full year 2023. Yes. That's a good question. I would say -- if you look at the risk from a sales perspective in our plan for 2023 and very consistent with what we said at the end of the third quarter. It's not going to necessarily be backlog, but it will be related to the availability of supply. And in particular, we have continuing challenges with power semiconductors and electronic components. \n So there may be a bit of a hedge in the back half of the year because we don't have great visibility in that market, similar to everybody who is trying to get their hands on those power semiconductors. In addition, there is still a healthy amount of book and ship that is out there for the back half of the year, and we'll have better visibility into that at the end of the first quarter and probably much better at the end of the first half. Specifically as it relates to electronic components and Gio can speak to the supply environment. But one of our objectives on this call is to make it clear that we're not through the supply chain issues, right? And I would say many components we purchase are much better than they were 3 months ago, 6 months ago. But there are certainly still challenges on very critical components that we have to procure across our entire product line, whether that's AC power or thermal. \n One, in particular, is the power semiconductors. And there's long lead times there, and we don't have great visibility. We do anticipate that improving as we go through the year. But our visibility there probably is a matter of quarters, not a matter of -- looking out what a year is going to potentially look like? Yes. This is David. So if you look at our guide, for '23. And we break down the components, I think, Page 33 in the appendix. So you can see how it kind of built up the most important, certainly, you got to start with adjusted EBITDA. And that certainly there'd be an expectation for that debt to flow through if that's higher or lower than what we're targeting. Putting working capital aside, the other three components, as Gio mentioned, there's some probability of variability there, but I wouldn't say significant. \n Certainly, if we're more profitable, we'll pay more taxes. That's just kind of how it works. But fairly certain that we would -- our CapEx number will come in within a range of what's reasonable with what we guided. And then interest, we're definitely subject to movement in interest rates. But if we have significant upside or slight downside, it more than likely isn't going to be related to those three components. It's going to be the working capital component. And if you look at the $75 million use for full year 2023, we certainly assume success in some of the working capital initiatives that Gio mentioned. \n Working capital in and of itself will be a headwind due to the 15% organic growth, right? That's just how it works. But with that said, it's not hundreds of millions of dollars. It's not a $300 million or $400 million headwind, and we're expecting very significant or including in our guidance, very significant working capital initiative benefits. So that headwind could be $1 million or $200 million, you can do the math. And that's based on what we think sales are going to be in the fourth quarter of '23 versus the fourth quarter of 2022. So we have some provision in these numbers for success with optimizing working capital, but it could end up being a conservative assumption. \n There's still a lot of complications. The supply chain is not back to stable. So there's a lot of challenges in front of us, but we're confident with this guidance we have provided. But if you look at the $350 million versus, if you will, an adjusted net income for the full year, it's probably 75%, 80%. We would target in the long run, being in the 90%-plus range. It's always hard for an industrial company to get to 100% of free cash flow conversion if the expectation is to grow 10% to 15% a year. \n With that said, we believe this is a reasonable guide between the $300 million and $400 million, but is definitely room for upside if we're able to execute some of our working capital initiatives quicker than what's assumed in the guidance. That would be the long-term goal. Yes. 90% of adjusted net income. I believe we can. And it -- if you look at our issues, they're all very fixable, right? Inventory increased this year, that was probably up $250 million. It was definitely somewhat of a chaotic environment, but we have a game plan for this year. \n And that also goes for many of the components of working capital. So AR, we had some complex larger orders that we had to process in 2022 with multiple deliverables, very tactical issues that we can address. So I feel fairly confident we can get to that 90% number in '24 and go forward. But let us get through 2023 first, and then we'll provide some insight on what we think the timing would be for that number going forward. Yes. So the significant use outside of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, Jeff, was related to the tax receivable agreement. There was a $75 million payment in the fourth quarter which takes that off our books completely. If you look at the leverage, if you look at the math at year-end, and you look at a trailing 12-month EBITDA number, I think our net debt leverage is about 5.6%, which certainly is much higher than we would like. \n But if you look at that same ratio looking at a forward-looking EBITDA number, meaning the approximately $865 million of EBITDA anticipated for '23. It's about 3.5x levered. And then if you assume the $350 million of expected free cash flow is used to delever, whether sitting in cash on the balance sheet or to pay down debt. The net leverage gets down to 3x. So if we execute upon our plan in 2023 there's a relatively quick path to that deleveraging. And our long-term goal is to keep leverage between 2x and 3x that we're willing to go either below or above that range for specific reasons. But in general, if we execute what we have on paper here in '23, we should be closer to 3x levered as we exit '23."

            "name": "Giordano Albertazzi",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Thank you very much. I can certainly confirm that already in my initial days as CEO there has been a renewed focus on executional rigor and productivity, combined with the intensity that fosters a high-performance culture. And we are on Slide 3. 2022 was certainly a story of two halves, the first half painful when we did a lot of the hard work needed for acceleration and the second half strong with indeed a very strong fourth quarter, the strongest in our history. \n Fourth quarter organic sales were up 22%, driven by very robust growth in Americas and EMEA. Asia and China, in particular, was hindered by the impact of COVID, and we expect this impact to be short in nature. We extend -- we ended the year again with a record backlog of $4.8 billion, which firmly supports our top line growth projections for 2023. Adjusted operating profit of $211 million was a little short of the guidance range. This is mainly due to the approximately $40 million less volume in China. Closed by the COVID wave there. ENI performance was also weaker than expected due to some project cost overruns. These headwinds were partially offset by foreign exchange, although still negative, more favorable than assumed in our previous guidance provided in October. \n We are pleased by our pricing performance. We were on plan as we realized $135 million of price in the fourth quarter, and we delivered $365 million for the full year. We executed on the commitment we made early last year. There may have been some skeptics who discounted our ability to get price. That is understandable. I firmly believe that to deliver on commitments is the best way to respond to skepticism. And this is true in general. We demonstrated good sequential improvement in cash in the fourth quarter, but adjusted free cash flow was below expectations. \n There are reasons for the shortfall such as delayed collections in China, again, due to COVID and higher inventory due to some continued supply chain constraints because adjusted free cash flow is crucial we're instilling more rigor accountability and discipline in the whole process. David Fallon and I are keenly focused on this. Let's look at 2023. Our guidance a significant stat forward -- a significantly improved performance. Organic sales are expected to increase 15% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance, mainly because of foreign exchange, we are raising our AOP guidance from the $730 million to $750 million we announced in October to $750 million, $800 million now, over 75% increase year-over-year. \n We're guiding to $300 million to $400 million in adjusted free cash flow, supported by our plan of increased profit and working capital optimization. We will provide additional details around these plans as we make our way through the slides. Of course, we execute the a quarter at a time. It starts with good execution in the first quarter, and we have details on our first quarter guidance later in the slide presentation. Let's now turn to Slide 4, and let's spend a few minutes on the market. \n Only one change from the October view. We moved cloud hyperscale down from green to yellow in EMEA. This was driven by seeing some market signals that demand may be stabilizing, albeit at pretty high levels. Worth noting in general, cloud and hyperscale providers may swing a bit between building capacity in-house or outsourced to [indiscernible] providers. So after the two categories should be looked at together. Our Asian market views remain consistent with last quarter. We have operated in a quieter market environment in Asia for 2022. \n I've recently visited Asia and I have to say I'm pretty encouraged by what I saw and heard on the ground. For example, India is really just at the beginning of what looks to be a meaningful investment cycle. Americas is also consistent with the last quarter market view. Even though cloud hyperscale may be coming off their height over the last couple of years, they are still growing and investing at a healthy pace and one that supports our trajectory of business. \n We have discussed periods of digestion before. Certain customers are digesting their capacity. But this is a normal part of the cycle, and they typically digest at different times, which smooths the overall impact in the market. Additionally, spending is being directed to higher-density loads, such as artificial intelligence which demands more compute power and the need for additional infrastructure. We also believe that there is a normalization of orders that is happening as supply chains improved and lead times reduce. \n As this continues, customers are likely going to return to more normal order behavior. That is good for the industry overall but they make order comparatives look more negative than what is really happening in the market. We remain cautious on the enterprise. Now that what we're seeing a different dynamic unfolding since last quarter, but more so because we are mindful of the macro around us. We know this segment would typically be the first to reflect a possible recession in the U.S.A. or at least a period of economic slowdown. \n This happened in 2020 with economic slowdowns related to COVID-19. So we are staying vigilant. All in all, we remain cautiously optimistic on the market, driven by the continued need for data globally and favorable technology trends like artificial intelligence, requiring a higher density and more compute power. Now let's move to Slide 5. Customer demand still feels good. This is also confirmed by conversations with our customers around the world. Levels of investment and demand for our products and services continue to be healthy. We had signals -- we have signaled that fourth quarter year-on-year orders growth would be negative given a very strong comparison in the prior year, and that is what happened. \n As an example, 4Q '21, we experienced an order growth rate of more than 100% in Americas. We expect to see the same in 1Q 2023 with a tough comparison with the prior year. When orders were up 34% and now an environment where customers return to a more normalized pattern of ordering. So we expect Q1 orders to be down double digits. It is hard to provide precision on what double digits could look like as normalization of worded partners is still unfolding. We continue to have record high backlog and ended the year at $4.8 billion, which is a 49% increase from the end of 2021. \n This is inclusive of absorbing some order cancellations from a large hyperscale provider. This backlog represents over 70% coverage of the 2023 sales guidance, which is a much higher coverage ratio than we have seen in the past. This is reflective of an industry characterized by a very tight supply chain and still dealing with disruptions. We do think a normalization of the backlog at Vertiv and in the industry in general, is starting. And we expect this to continue as customers are seeing gradual improvement in supply chain and associated reduction in the time. \n We believe this process of normalization of the backlog will really be quite healthy for the overall market. We delivered on our pricing expectation, as previously mentioned. We continue to exercise the pricing muscle I referred to already on the 26th of October to price for the value we provide to our customers. Inflation. We still anticipate it to be a headwind in 2023, but we expect to have a net favorable price versus overall inflation impact of approximately $100 million, thanks to the actions and executional rigor we are fostering. \n Supply chain continues to incrementally improve, but still not without its challenges, especially in the power electronics area. We are moving from a wack-a-mole environment to one where we are in better control also thanks to the increased supply chain resiliency, our alternative component and supply efforts are enabling. And in summary, while we see some mixed signals in the macro, the long-term demand continues to be healthy for our business. We have a bit of wind in our back relative to price cost, supply chain is trending a bit better. And we started the year in a very strong backlog position. \n Visibility is still not great in a dynamic global environment but we are focused on what we can control. I like where we are starting the year. Our fourth quarter performance sets up well for a successful 2023 despite navigating what could be a more challenging macro environment. We are strengthening and I'd like to repeat this, the operating models and executional rigor in general and certainly around everything cash flow. So with that, over to David to walk us through the financials. David? Well, thank you, David. Thank you very much, and we turn to Slide 14. We know that this guidance may look aggressive to some. It may as well look conservative to others. But I want you to share some points that supports our assumptions about our guidance. I'll start with adjusted operating profit. And let's look at the volume assumptions. We are at the highest backlog coverage point in our history over 30%. Additionally, there is always a lot more book and ship time and materials, services, spare parts, flow business. Parts of the business that transact on a very short cycle and provide additional volume on the year. Our Q4 book-to-bill ratio was 115% and high levels that have characterized the entire 2022. Obviously, some moderation in our book-to-bill ratio is expected going into 2023 as customers return to a more normalized, as I said, order pattern. \n This supply environment has been improving, and this should lead to a decrease in our need to do spot buys. We believe we have conservative estimates for inflation. We have a pricing plan that is largely already in backlog or based on actions that have already been taken and we have demonstrated our ability to get price. Let's look at the cash flow now. You have heard all of us speak directly about adjusted free cash flow. We know we did not execute well in this metric in 2022. Certainly, the improved adjusted operating profit starts off at a very different point for 2023. We have reasonable assumptions for elements that typically do not vary too much like interest back CapEx and we have strong working capital initiatives. \n This is a top priority for the organization, and we are managing this very closely. I would reference how we approached price last year. It was all hands on deck, rigor around the process accountability and focus on execution. And we executed well. The same rigor is around executing the working capital initiatives and the adjusted free cash flow generation. Let's now turn to Slide 15. Our focus areas for 2023 are clear, clear reflection of our priorities. \n We won the entire team pulling in the same direction. We are working on the culture fostering a high-performance culture where we do what we say, where ownership is clear where we hold ourselves accountable for delivering the results and we reward performance. Culture doesn't change overnight. It is a process. But as we strengthen our focus, we have seen signs that the high-performance culture is starting to take hold and we see that through improved financial results. I've been visiting many parts of the organization lately, including China, India, Mexico, Slovakia, Ireland, the Middle East. I have met many people at all levels. And I'm very encouraged by what I see. People who love and care for what they do and care for the company. We have a lot to do, but I feel the energy of the organization. Again, pricing, supply chain resiliency and trade working capital optimization are primary focus areas, and we will continue to build those muscles, continue to institutionalize this in the organization. \n This is what high-performing companies do. We still have great potential to operate in a more efficient and effective way across the company. There is no magic wand. It's constant focus on the things that matter and strong operational execution, rigorous, relentless, pragmatic execution at all levels and starting from the top. I am encouraged by finish to 2022. The year was certainly not profit but are signs of real progress permeating throughout the organization and most importantly, showing up in our financial results. \n Dave started off the call today by indicating 2022 was a year of transformation assertive. I wholeheartedly agree, and it is just the beginning. With that said, we will now turn the call over to the operator, who will open the line for questions. Scott, we know that paranoia is always very healthy. We try to exercise paranoia in everything, and everything we do when it comes to running the business almost religiously. This is Gio. But obviously, we're not able to share customer-specific information. But I would say it is not unusual sometimes that there are some reconfigurations in terms of what customers decide to do with their infrastructure. Having said that, of course, being paranoid, we keep an extremely sharp eye on our orders dynamics. Other now what we have signals -- we signaled, we have noticed -- we have not noticed anything extraordinary, let's say, in the dynamics. So we will continue to be -- to exercise extreme focus there, but nothing extraordinary. It is -- it's hard to refer to history here because I do not think that I've been in the industry, as you know, for quite some time. I have never seen anything like what has happened in the industry in the last 1.5 years, 2 years. The magnitude of the combination of lengthening lead times and demand growth has driven a let's say, desire to cover longer and longer demand periods of our customers. That is absolutely unprecedented. All in general, not just Vertex customers in the industry in general. So being able to say how that will undo or normalize, it's very, very hard. \n But our expectation is that it will probably take 6 months. But hey, this is a guess. We'll keep our eyes open and try to understand how it exactly unfolds. And I'll probably be able to tell better in it. Yes, I can comment further. Thank you, David, Nigel. So we have on the supply side of things to aspects at the same time in parallel. One is us getting, of course, stronger, more robust. As we explained, we have strengthened our SIOP Processes. We have made our supply network and supply base more resilient with multi-sourced components and also supplies. But at the same time, the market, albeit improving is certainly not normalizing that is at the same time on the supply side, especially as Dave was saying, everything that has to do with the power semiconductors. \n But the power semiconductors are present in this lot of things -- a lot of the components we use. They're not just as such, but components in the components we purchase. So we believe we are stronger. We believe we have figured a lot of things out during the course of 2022. But by all means, the message is not that everything is perfect out there. And it's still a complicated market, but we're much better equipped to navigate in that market. Well, there are two different dynamics at play. One, what I mentioned as our pricing muscle so an ability to better price for the value that we deliver. We deliver to our customers. So that's something that will always be there. and something that we did not have at least not with the efficacy that we have now in the past. So that stays I think that shouldn't read the phrase on the negative side. The message is despite an environment in which we see on the cost side in general, a moderating inflation, but inflation nonetheless, we still see that in many parts of our business, we still can continue to work the price lever. And that's what we're doing. \n When it comes to 2023, in particular, a big chunk of our price is already in backlog. And that price in our backlog of course is very important for us to deliver on our guidance. But also the price that is not yet in the backlog is a price that we see being realized with the orders that we are in taking. But expect over time a normalization also in terms of price. And when that happens, and it is not necessarily now in the market because, again, the inflationary trends are still there. When that happens, we are better equipped with an ability to price for value. Well, as I was saying, it's -- we can have a very sharp eye on all the signals in this moment in which the order dynamics are very dynamic. As we explained during the -- as we were going through the deck, we have no signals in this moment that would tell us in this moment. I would tell us that there is red looming behind the colors that you see here. But again, well, we keep our eyes wide open in case of something changes. When it comes to the EMEA, we see it more of a change of mix between cloud [indiscernible] and colocation, as I mentioned, in one of our -- in my comments earlier. \n And again, simply a change of mix between what the hyperscalers and cloud providers build for their own direct infrastructure vis-a-vis what they leave and the color may flip. I would not read dramatically into that. Just saying, hey, EMEA is going through the same type of order normalization that I've signaled and mentioned already, and we'll see how that plays out. So we may not have time to go into the details by region here when it comes to the backlog. But I must say that we are very, very happy about the sales leverage that we are obtaining, expanding the -- adding the E&I portfolio to the broader Vertiv go-to-market. And indeed, if you will, we've been also quite surprised by how strong the market reaction has been. So with that, as David was mentioning, we are expanding capacity. \n We are expanding capacity quite vigorously specifically for E&I. The rest is about accelerating the integration, making sure that the same rigorous executional approach that we are instigating for Vertiv as a whole is applicable to E&I and continue to drive price. Well, thank you. Thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I really appreciate the support and very much looking forward to reporting out on our Q1 2023 progress. So stay tuned. And again, a big thank you."

            "content": "Well, 2022 was quite a year of transformation at Vertiv, a year focused on driving price, Americas improvement and progress on a high-performing culture. After a very disappointing 2021, we developed an ambitious plan to turn around the performance of the business over the next 4 quarters. Fourth quarter results demonstrated marked improvement consistent with the profit profile we shared last February. \n Our adjusted free cash flow performance, however, was not what it should have been largely because of working capital. We have consistently said the fourth quarter '22 performance will position us well for '23, and we believe that it has. We are increasing our view on 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance primarily due to foreign exchange, and that represents an over 75% increase year-over-year. And our adjusted free cash flow is anticipated to improve significantly because of higher income and less working capital usage. \n The demand environment continues to look good, and we're entering 2023 with significant backlog. Gio's focus on improved execution on everything is already apparent, and it certainly demonstrated in the improved performance in the Americas. I'm very excited about where the company is headed with Gio's leadership. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to   Vertiv's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this call is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nLynne Maxeiner: Thank you, Bailey. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call.\n Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Operating Officer and President, Americas, Giordano Albertazzi.\n Before we begin, I point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv.\n These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings with the SEC.\n Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Our third quarter performance continues to support the profile of improvement that we presented in February of this year. Our financial performance escalated in the third quarter, as we anticipated, helped by a record level of price that was realized this quarter.\n We are doing things differently, especially in the Americas, and we are seeing that translate to an improved financial performance. I know demand is becoming a bigger question for all companies given the macroeconomic environment. Demand win was strong for Vertiv, the data center end market as a true secular demand story, data is just going to continue to grow.\n We continue to execute on operational improvements and I'm pleased to report good progress in Americas reflected in the adjusted operating margins improvement.\n The work in the Americas is far from done, but there are very encouraging signs. Our operational focus is paying off, and we anticipate this will be visible in our Q4 results in the Americas.\n We have another significant step-up in operational performance planned for this quarter. Similar to our last earnings call, David will walk you through in detail why we believe this will happen, and it will sound very consistent with our previous discussion.\n We made an announcement earlier this month on our CEO Succession Plan. Giordano Albertazzi is the name COO in addition to his duties as America's President till, we find a replacement, and will succeed Rob Johnson as the CEO on January 1 next year.\n I work closely with Gio and feel confident, he brings the right leadership and experience to drive Vertiv's performance. Anand, again, thank Rob for all he has done as CEO over the past 6 years in building Vertiv's strong competitive position and foundation for sustained growth.\n As we are in the final quarter of this year, I know attention is focused squarely on the setup for 2023. We've provided adjusted operating profit guidance earlier than usual for 2023 that represents a 60% increase over our current guidance for 2022.\n People have asked about our visibility given the world is a complicated place right now. While visibility isn't perfect, the management team feels confident in their ability to execute and deliver Q4 and what it portends for 2023, which should be a very good year for Vertiv and for our shareholders.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thank you, Dave. Starting with some key messages on Slide 3. We anticipated the volume ramp up in the back half of 2022 and we're certainly seeing it, with organic net sales up 20% in the third quarter, orders, excluding FX, were up 15%, which is even better than our preliminary orders number we provided earlier this month. We continue to see strong long-term market demand signals from our customers.\n Adjusted operating profit of $134 million was within the guidance range. Our improvement actions are taking hold, and we've seen the improvement building sequentially throughout the year. We delivered again on our price plan, realizing $110 million of price this quarter, and we raised our full year pricing expectations to $365 million.\n We saw price cost split $35 million year-over-year tailwind for this quarter. This tailwind will further strengthen into the fourth quarter and into 2023. Supply chain has improved over the last 90 days, even in some areas that have been hampering this, areas like circuit breakers, fans, and other certain electronic categories.\n Our work qualifying alternative suppliers is paying off, and these additional sources of supply support our fourth quarter volume projections. That being said, there are certain categories of power electronics that are still in short supply, and we expect them to remain so throughout at least mid-2023.\n Free cash flow is trending in the right direction, although we continue to carry high levels of inventory to support our increasing volume as fourth quarter is expected to be a record sales quarter for Vertiv. Orders have remained high, which is a great thing, but it has us carrying more inventory than expected.\n Fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to be an all-time record between $250 million and $300 million positive. And this should set us up, we think, for a great '23. We know our working capital is not optimized, and we are taking the full year projection down from our prior guidance, but we believe there is a significant additional cash benefit in 2023 and we have been working on plans and programs to make sure this happens.\n We are affirming the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance of $230 million at the midpoint, which continues to support our view of a very strong fourth quarter and we believe a very good position and very well for 2023.\n Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in our markets by region. A few changes in Americas market view. Enterprise has moved to yellow, indicating a bit of caution, but is consistent with what we've been seeing in other global regions. The Enterprise market is exhibiting more caution given to the macro uncertainty, including the possibility of a recession, but still remains positive.\n The Communication market in Americas has been very strong for a number of quarters, and there's been a lot of investment associated with 5G technology cycle. While it's coming off those high marks, telecom carriers still invest, both in new technology and their existing network infrastructure. EMEA and Asia markets views remain relatively healthy as well. All in all, strong market backdrop continued for what we do.\n To note, we have been aggressive with our pricing actions for several quarters now, and we continue to see strong demand. We can get price and the ability has been demonstrated each quarter as we make our way through the year.\n Moving to Slide 5. We still feel good about customer demand with orders up 15% in the quarter, excluding FX, and that is compared to last year's third quarter, where orders were up 17% from the prior year. We have highlighted that we anticipate year-over-year orders declining in Q4. That is more a product of a challenging comparison to the prior year. If you recall, orders were up 51% in the same period last year.\n Fourth quarter orders, adjusted FX, are expected to be relatively flat in line with third quarter orders. We posted another record-breaking backlog at the end of September of $4.7 billion, which provides great support as we think about our 2023 top line. We continue to execute on our pricing plan and have delivered pricing consistent with our framework each quarter in 2022.\n Our pricing plan of $135 million for fourth quarter includes, 80% already in the backlog and 20% to be realized on book and ship, but those actions have already taken place. We are clearly demonstrating we can get price in our markets.\n Supply chain has been improving, clearly not without disruption, but seeing things improve. Improving external market conditions, coupled with the extensive work the team has been doing to qualify new suppliers is helping our situation. The one area that is still tight in some of the semiconductor categories we specifically use.\n We use specialized high-end semiconductors different from some of the categories where you've seen in the market, a nice improvement on those. While availability is slightly improving for us in the specialized categories, we expect this tightness in the markets to continue through at least mid-'23.\n Some good news as it relates to our fan supplier. They are fully qualified and shipping production parts to us. There is favorability in the commodity and freight markets. We typically have 1 quarter lag before that reads through our P&L, but we anticipate seeing more favorability in fourth quarter and going on into 2023.\n Even with some good news at our back, we did raise the inflation estimate for the year by $15 million, with $5 million being realized in Q3, and $10 million anticipated in Q4. This is related to 2 primary factors: one, our regional sales mix is more heavily weighted to higher inflation zones. And we're also seeing some additional inflation in EMEA, mainly related to energy costs.\n In summary, our markets remain healthy. While recession proof is a strong term, there is an argument to be made, as Dave said, data will continue to grow through these economic cycles. That data has to be networked, has to be stored, and has to be processed in data centers where our equipment is. We are the market and technology leaders, and we are getting paid for what we do.\n Supply chain pressures, as I mentioned earlier, are easing, and we're seeing that benefit and expect that to continue to improve. Coupled with the work we have done to onboard new suppliers, we are proving operationally each quarter, and you're seeing it in our financial performance.\n Now I'll turn the call over to David to walk us through the financials. David? \nDavid Fallon: Perfect. Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results.\n Our net sales increased 21% from last year's third quarter and were up 20% organically, including 11% from volume and 9% from pricing. The E&I acquisition contributed $115 million, partially offset by $25 million from the sale of the Industrial UPS business at the end of last year.\n Foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales by approximately $85 million, with about 2/3 of that in EMEA due to the weakening of both the euro and the British pound.\n Adjusted operating profit of $134 million was within our guidance range, but at the lower end, primarily due to an incremental $10 million foreign exchange headwind compared to what we assumed this past August.\n This foreign exchange headwind includes both translation and transactional impacts within the regions where we buy and sell in currencies other than functional. Compared to prior year, we generated an additional $3 million of adjusted operating profit with the primary drivers summarized at the bottom of this page.\n Of note, as promised, we flipped the price/cost equation from negative to positive, generating a $35 million tailwind in the third quarter. We expect this tailwind to strengthen to about $80 million in the fourth quarter as we continue to deliver on our pricing commitments.\n Adjusted operating margin sequentially improved to 9.1% in the third quarter from 5.9% in the second quarter as we continue our margin expansion actions, expecting approximately 14% in the fourth quarter, which would be a record quarterly high.\n Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.23 for the quarter, which was in line with August guidance, and $0.03 higher than last year, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, partially offset by higher year-over-year interest expense, primarily due to debt pursuant to the E&I acquisition.\n Third quarter free cash flow was a use of $20 million. This use moderated sequentially in the third quarter from the second quarter. We anticipate free cash flow to be significantly positive, in fact, a record high in the fourth quarter.\n We spoke about an inventory reduction opportunity in 2023 on our last call, and we still believe this will happen. Supply chains are improving as our internal SIOP processes, both of which should contribute to lower inventory balances going forward.\n Next, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. All regions saw strong double-digit organic sales growth. The Americas region grew organically approximately 25%, equally balanced between volume and price. Americas adjusted operating profit of $115 million and margin of 16.2% were positively impacted from improved price/cost, but offset by higher investment in fixed costs, including to support the launch of our new Monterrey facility.\n We are encouraged with the margin improvement in the Americas from 11% in the first quarter to an expected 20% in the fourth quarter, an in-year increase of 900 basis points. Still significant work to do, still significant opportunity, but the operational improvements Giordano and his team have introduced are certainly gaining traction.\n Organic sales in APAC increased 17% from last year's third quarter, 70% from volume, 30% from price. Operating margins increased 150 basis points, primarily due to favorable price cost and volume leverage.\n Finally, on this slide, EMEA sales were up 14% organically, 2/3 of that from price and 1/3 from volume. As a reminder, EMEA had the most challenging year-over-year comparison as organic sales were up almost 18% in last year's third quarter.\n Inflation has been more pervasive in EMEA recently, at least compared to the other regions, especially related to energy and our price realization in that region did not fully offset these inflationary headwinds in the third quarter.\n As a result, EMEA experienced a small price cost headwind in Q3. We continue to evaluate this inflation and our pricing response, but we do anticipate price cost to be positive in EMEA for the fourth quarter, and we do anticipate a fairly significant step-up in operating margin in the fourth quarter as well.\n Turning to Slide 8. We summarize our updated fourth quarter financial guidance, reaffirming adjusted operating profit of $220 million to $240 million provided earlier this month. All metrics on this slide would be record quarterly highs and by significant margins, including free cash flow, which is projected to be between $250 million and $300 million. \n Of course, we still have to execute, and there is much work to be done to capture significant opportunity going forward, but as we have consistently communicated since the beginning of the year, this strong fourth quarter should provide a solid foundation for a very good 2023. This slide provides a lot of detail compared to last year's fourth quarter, and it captures the progress we have made in 12 months, notably the $135 million of incremental pricing.\n Despite this year-over-year improvement, probably more important for investors to understand the doability of the strong fourth quarter, is the incremental bridge from this year's third quarter, which we will cover in a couple of slides.\n Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our revised full year financial guidance, reconfirming adjusted operating profit of $450 million to $470 million provided earlier this month. As Rob mentioned in his key messages earlier, we are reducing full year free cash flow guidance by $125 million at the midpoint with approximately $60 million of that from changed expectations for year-end inventory, $30 million from lower expected EBITDA, and $30 million from lower expected cash collections.\n We had previously projected a more significant inventory reduction by year-end, but as we enter the fourth quarter with record projected sales volumes, and we anticipate continued strong volumes at the beginning of next year, we have reassessed those targets and will not press actions simply to hit a target.\n As mentioned, we have made good progress with SIOP, notably in the Americas. We have seen benefits from improved processes, and we still anticipate an inventory reduction at some point in 2023.\n Another driver of reduced full year free cash flow estimate is related to the delay of cash collection enhancements, including driving more significant advanced payments for large orders. This delay is temporal as we expect to see benefits from these actions in 2023.\n Nevertheless, fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to be a record quarterly high. $175 million was the previous high, and free cash flow will be an absolute focus for us in 2023. Certainly understanding that margin improvement will not translate into value creation unless we convert that into cash.\n Next, moving to Page 10. This is a format of a slide we shared back in August to provide transparency with our plan to achieve fourth quarter projections. The main drivers are similar to last time, with the most significant difference being the addition of some very volatile foreign exchange.\n The macro story is relatively straightforward outside of FX, our fourth quarter lift from third quarter should be driven by volume and price. We discussed the drivers of the volume increase last quarter, including the launch of our Monterrey facility, improving supply chain dynamics and normal favorable fourth quarter seasonality. The volume lift is more pronounced in the Americas and EMEA in the fourth quarter, but APAC is expecting a nice increase as well.\n Pricing is expected to provide an additional $40 million of operating profit in the fourth quarter with 80% of fourth quarter pricing already in backlog. Now of course, we still have to execute to achieve these strong results, but we certainly have clear line of sight to the fourth quarter performance, which we hope this slide demonstrates.\n Next, turning to Slide 11. We have very often discussed internally and externally, holding ourselves accountable to the quarterly sales and earnings profile we presented back in February. This slide visually captures what we said in February and how our results line up with that profile.\n February guidance is depicted with the bars, the blue being adjusted for foreign exchange. Our results, both actual and what we expect for the fourth quarter are depicted with the black line. As you can see, both sales and profitability trajectory profiles are very much consistent with our February guidance with our expected fourth quarter adjusted operating profit, when adjusted for foreign exchange, very consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year.\n So with that said, I now turn it back over to Dave Cote. Dave? \nDavid Cote: Hang on. 2.5 years of working remotely, and I still can't remember to hit the unmute button.\n I said a few things about Gio in my opening remarks, but I'd like to expand on that a bit. Gio is an industry veteran. He's an operator at [indiscernible] and he's been with Vertiv for over 24 years, serving in a variety of operational capacities and really given the terrific background to run a company. He drove significant operational and financial improvements while leading EMEA, tripling the adjusted operating profit in that region to over 18% in a 3-year period ending in '21.\n And we're seeing the early stages of a turnaround story shaping the Americas, where margin has sequentially been increasing. The SIOP process has been greatly improved. And a focus on creating a high-performing culture is apparent within the organization. He knows a lot about the industry and has a track record of performance in both Europe and the Americas, which together represent about 70% of Vertiv sales.\n His broad operational background and that success uniquely positioned him to turn Vertiv into a high-performing business. He is the right person to lead this company and at the right time. So I ask Gio to talk a bit about his work on the Americas, the key initiatives underway, and to provide some early thoughts on 2023 that provide an introduction -- a better introduction to all of you of our incoming CEO. So, Gio? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you, Dave. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the kind introduction.\n I want to assure everyone the transition is well underway, and we expect it to be quite similar actually. That is correct, I'm an operator at [indiscernible]. It is my passion. I'd say it's my natural in many respects. And I think I can add considerable value. I'd like to share some things we've been working on in the Americas.\n Since March, we have done quite a lot, the full assessment, the transformation plan focused on getting price, ensuring leadership accountability, strengthening communication processes, operational excellence, systems and certainly fostering a strong sense of urgency. We have improved the SIOP process, have simplified the organization to focus on accountability and speed. We're driving the Americas regions towards a high-performance culture.\n Still in the early stages, but I'm encouraged by the sequential improvements we are experiencing.\n Let's turn to Slide 13. As I think about 2023, focus areas are clear and consistent with what we have been working on, margin improvement, price and cost, free cash flow generation, working capital improvements and profitable growth. We know the levers to achieve these objectives. We will have operational teams focused and accountable to meeting that. We will do so with a keen sense of urgency and rigor.\n Slide 14, please. And this slide shows some of our early thoughts on 2023. As you can see, visually, you should have more tailwinds than headwinds. Our backlog and order pace support healthy top line for 2023. End market demand is strong. We know how to get price. Additionally, we have some moderation of commodity and trade costs, and this year fixed cost will be held constant.\n Cash will be helped by overall improved profitability, but also from unlocking significant working capital opportunities. These objectives are well within reach. There will also be some headwinds, certain categories of electronics as Rob say, remain tight, and there will be inflationary pressure as it relates to energy costs in EMEA, as an example. That will not only impact us, but also impact our suppliers.\n FX remains volatile. There has been much discussion on potential recession. We don't expect it should have a big impact on our sales, but we are taking steps right now, for example, to restrict external hiring in anticipation. We believe that at the same time, sorry. But I like the view from here we can navigate these uncertainties, because we participate in a very -- in very good end markets. We are market and technology leaders. We have global scale. We have tremendous installed base, and we are very relevant with the key customers in our markets.\n We have a sharp focus on operational execution and excellence. We believe 2023 can be a very good year for Vertiv and Vertiv's shareholders. And candidly, as you may have picked up on this already in the last few minutes, I truly love this business and I indeed, I love the company profoundly. I'm very excited about Vertiv's future. And you can tell I have a lot of passion, sometimes my passion takes over, and I tend to overelaborate on things. Hey, my Italian heritage must mean something indeed. So please bear with me. Work item and the upcoming Q&A, certainly an opportunity to prove myself.\n But before that, I want to wholeheartedly thank Rob for all he has done for Vertiv in the last 6 years. It was a lot of heavy lifting to do as we became a Vertiv, a stand-alone company 6 years ago. Rob took what was almost a $4 billion start-up and transformed it into a growth company. We are the partner of choice of our customers, and we are very relevant across the entire market space. This happened thanks to Rob's leadership. We are grateful. So big thank you. Big thank you, Rob.\n With that, we will now turn the call over to the operator, who will open the line for questions. Thank you very much. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Congratulations, Gio. Good luck to you, Rob. Maybe this one is for you, Gio. I know it's early in your tenure in the Americas, but maybe you could give us a little more color into what has been the low-hanging fruit that you've been able to consume in the Americas to help boost margin over the last couple of quarters?\n And what do you think is going to be more difficult to change and/or could take longer to change within the Americas organization versus your original expectations? \nGiordano Albertazzi: I would point to 3 things here, Andy. Certainly, a lot of focus on the pricing muscle that we reinforced dramatically. And I think we start to see the results. A lot of focus, as I said, on making sure that there is accountability and accountability happens also through very strong governance and a very consistent way of running the region operationally.\n One thing that we have done, and we've been vocal about is, a return to office by which we make sure that everyone cooperate and stays focused on delivering on our objectives. And it's a part of a cultural transformation towards making this truly a high-performance culture, not just the Americas, because entire plan is that has started to deliver the dividends, I believe.\n But then we can elaborate on other elements that are the improvements of capacity, opening the Monterrey factory being probably the most visible example, but think about a broader capacity enhancement effort that has gone through across the entire business.\n The job we have done on reinforcing processes. And I always like to mention and also Dave did talk about the SIOP, the sales inventory operations planning that is really the end-to-end glue that connects our ability to deliver to the ability of telling the customer -- sorry, the suppliers, what we will need in the future, all the more reasons crucial in times in which supply chain is complicated.\n I would add to the equation, the strong effort that we've been doing is, as we benefiting still doing to multisource critical components, all elements that have contributed is an orchestration. There's no one kind of a -- 1 super bullet here. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Very helpful, Gio. And then maybe just stepping back, can you give us more color into the market environment you guys are seeing? There obviously are a couple more yellows in the Americas now in terms of the markets you highlighted. Have you seen any deferrals in orders within your core Enterprise end markets?\n And could you elaborate on the stability of CapEx from Enterprise and Communications customers, particularly in the Americas? And what gives you confidence that cloud and colocation customers will stay green moving forward? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. I would say that order cancellation is absolutely within the norm, what we -- within the norm or normal business cycle. So there, I'd say de minimis. What we have -- what we continue to see and have evidence, not just from our order intake, but also from the multiple conversations that we're having with all the relevant and large hyperscale and colo players, that Rob and I are doing also as part of the handover process, is that demand is there, and demand continues to be robust.\n On the Enterprise side, we just want to be a little bit more signal with some caution, but it's not for kind of an evidence of weakening of the signal. It's just that probably the macroeconomic environment might signal was a bit more prudent. But I remain quite positive about the strength of the market in the Americas going forward. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: So Gio for Enterprise, it's not so much what you're seeing, but just prudent caution moving forward. Is that fair? \nGiordano Albertazzi: That's fair. That's absolutely fair. That's fair, Andy. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Congratulations. Can you just give us a little bit of color as kind of snapping the line today and looking at what price you have in backlog and where commodities stand? What -- how much of that bridge to next year is -- reflects kind of what's prevailing today from that perspective, price cost-wise? Just math. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Yes. Good question, Steve. This is David. I used to had to say this is David, because they would confuse Gary and my voice. I don't think they'll do that with Giordano.\n But -- so when you look at the progression of price through 2022, we consistently said we had to burn through the backlog that was included in pricing or the pricing that was in backlog at the end of '21. So I think 80% of our sales in the first quarter of this year, was in backlog at the end of '21. In the fourth quarter, only 20% of our sales will be in backlog from 2021.\n And as a result, you can see the significant increase in ramp-up of pricing during the year. So I think we had $40 million in Q1, and we'll have $135 million of year-over-year pricing in Q4.\n I don't want to say we've reached a level of stability with pricing, but certainly, as it translates into profitability in the P&L, the fourth quarter will really be that first quarter where we can demonstrate what we can do as it relates to pricing at the level that arguably, we probably should have been pricing at.\n So if you look at the wraparound impact for 2023 from pricing, and this just assumes that we keep the same pricing levels exiting Q4 into 2023, it's about $150 million to $200 million. We would expect to do better than that, because we continue with our pricing efforts.\n As it relates to inflation for next year, it's probably too soon. We certainly think there will be a year-over-year gross headwind from inflation. But from just about any perspective, we certainly would expect to be price cost positive next year, but probably too early to quantify what we think the impact will be for inflation. \nC. Stephen Tusa: So then I guess that's kind of like if we assume no inflation, that's part of the way there. I think there's a bit more of a gap you have to bridge. I mean, what are you assuming volume growth? Or are you like -- are there one-timers that reverse out of this year? Like, maybe just a bit more color on the bridge or any other items? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Probably too early to add a whole lot of detail to 2023. I know we put that $730 million to $750 million number out there at -- in August, and we reconfirm that. But as it relates to kind of filling in the details, it's probably too soon. And we'll provide a more robust bridge from '22 to '23 in February. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Sprague: Maybe back to Gio. Gio, with the long history at Emerson and then through Platinum ownership and the like, obviously, you've seen a lot of ups and downs and kind of some turmoil in this business. I think you partially answered my question to your response to Andy, but just kind of stepping back, big picture.\n What holistically do you want to drive going forward? And do you have a comfort level with this kind of a longer-range forecast of this being upwards of a 20% margin business on an annualized basis going forward? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, clearly, I have confidence in what we have shared, and thank you for the question.\n The -- as -- and all time -- a long time, let me say, because I've seen the company evolve over time. And I would say this company that has still a big potential to -- a big potential to operate in a more effective way.\n Again, the focus areas as I was mentioning, really around operational execution, continued margin expansion. We have work to do as we're saying on working capital and very, very central is our cultural evolution towards the high-performance culture.\n Again, I've worked in many parts of the organization. So not only under a different brand, if you will, but also in multiple roles. So I believe I have an ability to lead the organization that is pretty advantages, let me say.\n And again, no magic wands, no silver bullet, it's a lot of focus on operational execution, on -- focusing on the things that matter to drive cash and to drive profitability. But again, it's enabling that with a cultural enhancement that we have started to drive. \nJeffrey Sprague: And then on execution as David Fallon so appropriately said, you still actually have to deliver the guide. But can you give us a little bit more perspective on how much of the guide is in your hands as opposed just kind of executing on backlog versus real question marks about supply availability, maybe question mark still about Monterrey being able to fully wrap up -- ramp up, I don't know if you feel it, that's 100% where you need it to be. But if you were to come up short here in Q4, where would it likely be in your opinion? \nDavid Fallon: Yes, Jeff, this is David. And there's still a ton of variables, and it's not only variables from a macro perspective, but within region. I think what we have said consistently over the last 2 or 3 quarters is that our issue is not a demand issue. The backlog is there. We have the orders. Probably the biggest risk is related to supply.\n And even though a lot of that supply has cleared up, notably with electronic components based on things we have done proactively, including qualifying new suppliers. And we talked a lot about the fan suppliers, but there still is a lot of volatility out there.\n And for a lot of these components, it's day-to-day, week-to-week. So we have better visibility than we had 60, 90 days ago. But I would still say there's risk as it relates to production and shipment. It's not necessarily a demand issue, I think we talked about fairly consistently. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Correct. And your question specifically on Monterrey, we are happy about the way the plan is unfolding. We have a great team, and the team are delivering on our plan. But again, as Dave was saying, it's the challenges around components, just exactly as said by him. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. \nScott Davis: When you guys talk about adding new suppliers and like specking out new suppliers, it sounds inherently inflationary. I mean, you lose some scale, I suppose, with that supplier. How material is that when you think about your kind of bill of goods? \nGiordano Albertazzi: I would say that there is a counterargument to that. When you add supplier, you add bargaining power at the same time. So it is more than we see the 2 things that are pretty much offset. \nScott Davis: Okay. That's surprising and good, positive. The follow-on question is just on the stickiness of price increases. Are there situations where if raw material costs go down, et cetera, you are mandated to give back some of that price when we get into '23? \nDavid Fallon: Yes, Scott, this is David. In some cases, yes. So we've included material cost escalation clauses in some of our master sales agreements. And -- but there are bands included in those. So it's not dollar for dollar, penny for penny, they have to expand either upwards or downwards outside of that band. And to some extent, there will be some pricing impact, but we don't consider that a significant risk heading into 2023. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I have 2 as well. Maybe to start with on free cash flow. Is the way to think about how much excess working capital inventory you think you're carrying right now? And do you expect all of that to sort of convert into free cash flow in '23, or would be a much more elongated time frame for higher free cash flow and more working capital optimization? So let's just understand, how much extra inventory do you have? And how does that normalization looks like through '23? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I'll start, Amit. So maybe I'd start with some facts. So our inventory level at the end of 2020 was about $450 million. We expect, at least on a GAAP basis, our inventory level at the end of this year will be around $765 million. So that's a $300 million increase in inventory, and that includes some foreign exchange benefit.\n So very clearly, inventory has increased each of the past 2 years. And very clearly at a level that is, as you say, in excess of what we need to run the business, we believe, on a go-forward basis.\n Now there are some contributory factors. Certainly, volume is significantly higher than it was when we exit 2020. And the supply chain has created many issues, not only for us, but many, many industrial companies out there.\n So it's hard at this point and probably premature to quantify what we think that benefit is, but it's something certainly we've been working on during the year. We could have probably taken that inventory level down a little bit lower at an exit point in 2022, but based on the significant volumes that we have to deliver this year and we anticipate heading into next year, we thought it prudent to not be overly aggressive.\n But with that said, because of the SIOP improvements, because some of the things we're doing with supply chain, we do believe there would be an inventory reduction at some point in 2023. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I could just follow-up. If I look at the midpoint that you guided for December sort of the 2022 numbers, I think there's about $300 million of material and freight inflation that helped kind of a headwind, right? If you want to think about how much is material versus freight explicitly? And is it fair to assume that the freight cost has given what's happening in the world should start to trend lower and that at least would be nice tailwind in '23? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So I think for the full year, our material and freight inflation number's $305 million. I think that's what you're referring to. About 80% of that is material and 20% is freight. And we include both spot buys and the material inflation and premium freight in the freight number.\n And we, too, are seeing some of the favorable benefits of freight rates. I would say 90% of what we do is on contract as opposed to spot. So we won't see the benefit immediately, but we also have adjustment clauses in those contracts, which should favorably benefit us over time. And we would say certainly at the beginning of 2023. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: I could just -- I'd like to just ask a modeling question, since you've been through a lot of the higher-level stuff. So I think it was -- Rob went through the -- sorry, I think it was Dave that went through the Americas margin outlook for 4Q.\n But -- what about Asia Pac and EMEA, like how much improvement are you guys expecting to see in the fourth quarter? And also any color on how organic growth stacks up by region, would be helpful as well. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So I think in the last presentation, we spelled out full year expectations by quarter for adjusted operating margin by region. We did not include that in this quarter, and we knew somebody would ask about it.\n So we have the numbers ready. Yes. So Americas, we're targeting about 20%. That's about 400 basis point lift from Q3. EMEA, and this is based on the expectation of being price cost positive in Q4, and also the benefit of volume leverage, we anticipate adjusted operating profit in EMEA to be in the mid-20s. So call it, 24%, 25%.\n So down from what we had previously disclosed because of the additional inflation that we talked about, but still, a significant increase from what we saw in Q3 and a very significant increase from what we saw in Q4 of last year. And APAC, we would anticipate being relatively flat in Q4 versus Q3. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. And just anything on organic growth by the 3 regions as well, like, if there's a big divergence? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So I think organic growth for total Vertiv in Q4 would be 25%. And you got to take a step back and realize you're saying 25%. That's a big number. There is some divergence across the regions. I would say, certainly highest in the Americas, and that could be 30% to 40% increase driven by both volume and price. EMEA year-over-year is probably in the mid-20s. And I would say, APAC is probably up about 10%. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. That's helpful. And just on the order backlog, how far out are you guys booking now? Are you like a long way into filling up 2023? Are you accepting orders for 2024? Just curious on lead times at this point. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. Nicole, this is Gio. The majority of our orders now are 2023 and in particular, on the first -- on the first half of 2023. We have some second half 2023. And the -- beyond 2023 is just a minor -- it's just a minor part of our backlog today. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Rob, I appreciate all your help. Best wishes and Gio, congrats on the new responsibilities.\n First question is on the 2023 outlook. If there is a mild to moderate recession in at least parts of the world, do you think that kind of EBIT level you're guiding for is achievable? \nDavid Fallon: Our goal would be to maintain profitability regardless of what happened to the top line. Our industry is certainly different than others. No one's recession-proof, but based on the size of our backlog heading into next year. And we certainly don't think the recession impact on use of data and building data centers is certainly going to be perfectly correlated for next year.\n So even in a recession, we feel pretty good about our top line. But if there are headwinds with the top line that roll through variable contribution margins, we'll take the necessary steps from a fixed cost basis to offset it. And our goal would be to maintain that $730 million to $750 million adjusted operating profit outlook regardless of any impact from the recession. \nMark Delaney: My follow-up question is on E&I. If memory serves me correctly, originally, that was tracking to something like $0.10 at the time of acquisition. I believe the slides, it ended up as a $0.02 contributor to EPS for this year. That's the latest assumption for full year EPS contribution from E&I.\n The question has something fundamentally changed around E&I compared to when you did the transaction? Or is this the same type of supply chain and some of these price cost issues that broader Vertiv investment you are dealing with, and over time, we should still be thinking of the same sort of longer-term benefits from the E&I acquisition? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Mark. I would say from a strategic perspective, we're more excited about E&I and the positive contributions to Vertiv today than we were at the time of the acquisition. And part of the value equation there was based on revenue synergies. And I would say, our expectation for revenue synergies are probably 3x, if not more, what we had initially anticipated.\n Now unfortunately, that's not showing up in the numbers this year. So my depiction of E&I, probably rather crudely is a bad year, great acquisition. A lot of the issues that E&I is seeing from a profitability perspective this year are identical with what we have seen with Vertiv.\n So if you look at the operating profit margin profile quarter-over-quarter this year, I think it started at low teens in Q1, maybe 14%, and it should exit the year closer to 20%. And the story is similar. Inflation hit with a pretty good-sized backlog at the end of last year, and we were just a little bit slow in getting price. And if you look at the price we get in the fourth quarter, that's what really increases the margin from that low teens to 20%.\n So I would say, we are more excited today than we were at the time of the acquisition, and sometimes we get asked with if you had to do it all over again, would you still do the deal. And the answer is a very profound robust, absolutely. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes, 100% for this deal, 100%. I think it's strategically made sense and all the more reasons it makes a ton of sense, ton of sense now. So we're very, very happy about the decision made back then. \nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Lance Vitanza from Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: The first is just to confirm regarding the new fan supplier, it sounds like that's really no longer perspective. You are receiving fans in volume; you're assembling them into products. Is that right? And have you shipped product with the new fans inside yet? Or does that begin later in the quarter or perhaps early in 2023? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We have -- Vitanza, this is Gio. We have absolutely started -- and that and other actions we've taken on the fan supply side of the equation are greatly improving our ability to deliver on the numbers. But the answer is yes, it has happened. Not only it is happening. It has happened. \nLance Vitanza: Okay. And then definitely, you called out that some supply chain easing, which is, of course, good news. On the other hand, the semiconductors still remain tight through the first half of 2023. So my question is, do you see that tightness in semiconductors? Do you see that putting pressure on 2023 revenue? Or is that just putting pressure on the margins in AOP and so forth?\n And then if there's any sort of sense for what you think that AOP number could have been if it weren't for the tightness in the semiconductors? I would appreciate hearing your thoughts there, too. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, let me answer operationally here. So we have been dealing with a tight supply market when it comes to everything, IGBT, that type of semiconductor. And as I've said, we expect that to continue. So we will -- and we have been taking precautionary measures as well in terms of qualifying new suppliers. So we factor the challenges in our plans. And I don't know, David, if you want to add anything. \nDavid Fallon: No. It would be really tough to quantify what the impact is. I mean, certainly greater than 0. And we're not talking tens of millions, right? So you see the size of our backlog, it continues to grow. And we think, we see the benefit of some of the very proactive actions we've taken during the year to address the issue. We see that in the fourth quarter. But you can't go back in time and fix the situation in Q2 and Q3.\n So it's in the hundreds of millions, if you look at lost revenue earlier in the year. That's kind of a ballpark. There's a lot of -- that's a multivariable equation, but suffice it to say, it has been very significant. \nOperator: Our final question today comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: Congratulations and Gio, great meeting you. Just a question, there were headlines about an activist. If you could just sort of talk to us about what kind of conversations you've had with the activist? Any update or color you can provide to us? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. It took the last question, Andrew. So good question. And we don't want to necessarily elaborate too much. The folks at this call, certainly on third quarter earnings. But I would say, we're actually very excited to welcome a new shareholder, a very large shareholder.\n A shareholder, who certainly, as they communicated their investment thesis, very consistent with our management thesis. And that is as a company operating in a great industry like we do, with the continued operational improvements and some of the things that Gio mentioned with a focus on developing a high-performance culture.\n There's considerable, considerable value here to unlock and it's all the things we've been saying over the last year or so. Their investment doesn't change our strategy or our priorities. Our interests are aligned, just like with any other shareholder. And as we execute and perform going forward, our interests certainly will continue to be aligned. \nAndrew Obin: Terrific answer. And just a follow-up question. Just going forward, how do you think about the trade-off between increasing R&D investment and keeping your commitment to keeping fixed cost constant? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, that's clearly a constant trade-off that we are addressing day in, day out. And running every business is an exercise of allocation of scarce resource. And we are no exception. And we see a lot of value and innovation as we've been kept saying during the course of at least the last 2 years.\n So it is really a matter of allocation of priorities towards innovation. But also go back to what I was saying at the beginning around operational execution, operational execution for us means a lot of opportunity for efficiency. And the efficiency is assured, you can look at our efficiency as a source of funding for innovation, loosely. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks. \nRob Johnson: Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for your time today. As this is my last earnings call, as CEO of Vertiv, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge and thank a few people.\n And I'd like to start with Platinum Equity for creating this opportunity and believing in me and supporting us through the turnaround of this great company. I certainly want to thank our customers. I know we've cost pain over the last year, but we're working through that and thank you for sticking with us and sticking loyal to our brand.\n The employees for all the work you've done and all the work you're going to have to do going forward. We've got a great '23 to look forward to. So I want to thank the employees, the Board of Directors with a special thanks to Dave Cote for the support and the mentoring and coaching. And of course, I want to thank all the shareowners for their support in Vertiv now and going forward.\n It's been an honor serving as CEO, and I'm more confident now than ever. The future of Vertiv and its ability to create long-term value for the stakeholders is the brightest days are ahead, and you're in great hands with Giordano as we go forward.\n So again, thank you for the opportunity to serve you. \nOperator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Giordano Albertazzi",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the kind introduction.\n I want to assure everyone the transition is well underway, and we expect it to be quite similar actually. That is correct, I'm an operator at [indiscernible]. It is my passion. I'd say it's my natural in many respects. And I think I can add considerable value. I'd like to share some things we've been working on in the Americas.\n Since March, we have done quite a lot, the full assessment, the transformation plan focused on getting price, ensuring leadership accountability, strengthening communication processes, operational excellence, systems and certainly fostering a strong sense of urgency. We have improved the SIOP process, have simplified the organization to focus on accountability and speed. We're driving the Americas regions towards a high-performance culture.\n Still in the early stages, but I'm encouraged by the sequential improvements we are experiencing.\n Let's turn to Slide 13. As I think about 2023, focus areas are clear and consistent with what we have been working on, margin improvement, price and cost, free cash flow generation, working capital improvements and profitable growth. We know the levers to achieve these objectives. We will have operational teams focused and accountable to meeting that. We will do so with a keen sense of urgency and rigor.\n Slide 14, please. And this slide shows some of our early thoughts on 2023. As you can see, visually, you should have more tailwinds than headwinds. Our backlog and order pace support healthy top line for 2023. End market demand is strong. We know how to get price. Additionally, we have some moderation of commodity and trade costs, and this year fixed cost will be held constant.\n Cash will be helped by overall improved profitability, but also from unlocking significant working capital opportunities. These objectives are well within reach. There will also be some headwinds, certain categories of electronics as Rob say, remain tight, and there will be inflationary pressure as it relates to energy costs in EMEA, as an example. That will not only impact us, but also impact our suppliers.\n FX remains volatile. There has been much discussion on potential recession. We don't expect it should have a big impact on our sales, but we are taking steps right now, for example, to restrict external hiring in anticipation. We believe that at the same time, sorry. But I like the view from here we can navigate these uncertainties, because we participate in a very -- in very good end markets. We are market and technology leaders. We have global scale. We have tremendous installed base, and we are very relevant with the key customers in our markets.\n We have a sharp focus on operational execution and excellence. We believe 2023 can be a very good year for Vertiv and Vertiv's shareholders. And candidly, as you may have picked up on this already in the last few minutes, I truly love this business and I indeed, I love the company profoundly. I'm very excited about Vertiv's future. And you can tell I have a lot of passion, sometimes my passion takes over, and I tend to overelaborate on things. Hey, my Italian heritage must mean something indeed. So please bear with me. Work item and the upcoming Q&A, certainly an opportunity to prove myself.\n But before that, I want to wholeheartedly thank Rob for all he has done for Vertiv in the last 6 years. It was a lot of heavy lifting to do as we became a Vertiv, a stand-alone company 6 years ago. Rob took what was almost a $4 billion start-up and transformed it into a growth company. We are the partner of choice of our customers, and we are very relevant across the entire market space. This happened thanks to Rob's leadership. We are grateful. So big thank you. Big thank you, Rob.\n With that, we will now turn the call over to the operator, who will open the line for questions. Thank you very much. I would point to 3 things here, Andy. Certainly, a lot of focus on the pricing muscle that we reinforced dramatically. And I think we start to see the results. A lot of focus, as I said, on making sure that there is accountability and accountability happens also through very strong governance and a very consistent way of running the region operationally.\n One thing that we have done, and we've been vocal about is, a return to office by which we make sure that everyone cooperate and stays focused on delivering on our objectives. And it's a part of a cultural transformation towards making this truly a high-performance culture, not just the Americas, because entire plan is that has started to deliver the dividends, I believe.\n But then we can elaborate on other elements that are the improvements of capacity, opening the Monterrey factory being probably the most visible example, but think about a broader capacity enhancement effort that has gone through across the entire business.\n The job we have done on reinforcing processes. And I always like to mention and also Dave did talk about the SIOP, the sales inventory operations planning that is really the end-to-end glue that connects our ability to deliver to the ability of telling the customer -- sorry, the suppliers, what we will need in the future, all the more reasons crucial in times in which supply chain is complicated.\n I would add to the equation, the strong effort that we've been doing is, as we benefiting still doing to multisource critical components, all elements that have contributed is an orchestration. There's no one kind of a -- 1 super bullet here. Yes. I would say that order cancellation is absolutely within the norm, what we -- within the norm or normal business cycle. So there, I'd say de minimis. What we have -- what we continue to see and have evidence, not just from our order intake, but also from the multiple conversations that we're having with all the relevant and large hyperscale and colo players, that Rob and I are doing also as part of the handover process, is that demand is there, and demand continues to be robust.\n On the Enterprise side, we just want to be a little bit more signal with some caution, but it's not for kind of an evidence of weakening of the signal. It's just that probably the macroeconomic environment might signal was a bit more prudent. But I remain quite positive about the strength of the market in the Americas going forward. That's fair. That's absolutely fair. That's fair, Andy. Well, clearly, I have confidence in what we have shared, and thank you for the question.\n The -- as -- and all time -- a long time, let me say, because I've seen the company evolve over time. And I would say this company that has still a big potential to -- a big potential to operate in a more effective way.\n Again, the focus areas as I was mentioning, really around operational execution, continued margin expansion. We have work to do as we're saying on working capital and very, very central is our cultural evolution towards the high-performance culture.\n Again, I've worked in many parts of the organization. So not only under a different brand, if you will, but also in multiple roles. So I believe I have an ability to lead the organization that is pretty advantages, let me say.\n And again, no magic wands, no silver bullet, it's a lot of focus on operational execution, on -- focusing on the things that matter to drive cash and to drive profitability. But again, it's enabling that with a cultural enhancement that we have started to drive. Correct. And your question specifically on Monterrey, we are happy about the way the plan is unfolding. We have a great team, and the team are delivering on our plan. But again, as Dave was saying, it's the challenges around components, just exactly as said by him. I would say that there is a counterargument to that. When you add supplier, you add bargaining power at the same time. So it is more than we see the 2 things that are pretty much offset. Yes. Nicole, this is Gio. The majority of our orders now are 2023 and in particular, on the first -- on the first half of 2023. We have some second half 2023. And the -- beyond 2023 is just a minor -- it's just a minor part of our backlog today. Yes, 100% for this deal, 100%. I think it's strategically made sense and all the more reasons it makes a ton of sense, ton of sense now. So we're very, very happy about the decision made back then. We have -- Vitanza, this is Gio. We have absolutely started -- and that and other actions we've taken on the fan supply side of the equation are greatly improving our ability to deliver on the numbers. But the answer is yes, it has happened. Not only it is happening. It has happened. Well, let me answer operationally here. So we have been dealing with a tight supply market when it comes to everything, IGBT, that type of semiconductor. And as I've said, we expect that to continue. So we will -- and we have been taking precautionary measures as well in terms of qualifying new suppliers. So we factor the challenges in our plans. And I don't know, David, if you want to add anything. Well, that's clearly a constant trade-off that we are addressing day in, day out. And running every business is an exercise of allocation of scarce resource. And we are no exception. And we see a lot of value and innovation as we've been kept saying during the course of at least the last 2 years.\n So it is really a matter of allocation of priorities towards innovation. But also go back to what I was saying at the beginning around operational execution, operational execution for us means a lot of opportunity for efficiency. And the efficiency is assured, you can look at our efficiency as a source of funding for innovation, loosely."

            "content": "Perfect. Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results.\n Our net sales increased 21% from last year's third quarter and were up 20% organically, including 11% from volume and 9% from pricing. The E&I acquisition contributed $115 million, partially offset by $25 million from the sale of the Industrial UPS business at the end of last year.\n Foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales by approximately $85 million, with about 2/3 of that in EMEA due to the weakening of both the euro and the British pound.\n Adjusted operating profit of $134 million was within our guidance range, but at the lower end, primarily due to an incremental $10 million foreign exchange headwind compared to what we assumed this past August.\n This foreign exchange headwind includes both translation and transactional impacts within the regions where we buy and sell in currencies other than functional. Compared to prior year, we generated an additional $3 million of adjusted operating profit with the primary drivers summarized at the bottom of this page.\n Of note, as promised, we flipped the price/cost equation from negative to positive, generating a $35 million tailwind in the third quarter. We expect this tailwind to strengthen to about $80 million in the fourth quarter as we continue to deliver on our pricing commitments.\n Adjusted operating margin sequentially improved to 9.1% in the third quarter from 5.9% in the second quarter as we continue our margin expansion actions, expecting approximately 14% in the fourth quarter, which would be a record quarterly high.\n Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.23 for the quarter, which was in line with August guidance, and $0.03 higher than last year, primarily due to the timing of income tax expense, partially offset by higher year-over-year interest expense, primarily due to debt pursuant to the E&I acquisition.\n Third quarter free cash flow was a use of $20 million. This use moderated sequentially in the third quarter from the second quarter. We anticipate free cash flow to be significantly positive, in fact, a record high in the fourth quarter.\n We spoke about an inventory reduction opportunity in 2023 on our last call, and we still believe this will happen. Supply chains are improving as our internal SIOP processes, both of which should contribute to lower inventory balances going forward.\n Next, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. All regions saw strong double-digit organic sales growth. The Americas region grew organically approximately 25%, equally balanced between volume and price. Americas adjusted operating profit of $115 million and margin of 16.2% were positively impacted from improved price/cost, but offset by higher investment in fixed costs, including to support the launch of our new Monterrey facility.\n We are encouraged with the margin improvement in the Americas from 11% in the first quarter to an expected 20% in the fourth quarter, an in-year increase of 900 basis points. Still significant work to do, still significant opportunity, but the operational improvements Giordano and his team have introduced are certainly gaining traction.\n Organic sales in APAC increased 17% from last year's third quarter, 70% from volume, 30% from price. Operating margins increased 150 basis points, primarily due to favorable price cost and volume leverage.\n Finally, on this slide, EMEA sales were up 14% organically, 2/3 of that from price and 1/3 from volume. As a reminder, EMEA had the most challenging year-over-year comparison as organic sales were up almost 18% in last year's third quarter.\n Inflation has been more pervasive in EMEA recently, at least compared to the other regions, especially related to energy and our price realization in that region did not fully offset these inflationary headwinds in the third quarter.\n As a result, EMEA experienced a small price cost headwind in Q3. We continue to evaluate this inflation and our pricing response, but we do anticipate price cost to be positive in EMEA for the fourth quarter, and we do anticipate a fairly significant step-up in operating margin in the fourth quarter as well.\n Turning to Slide 8. We summarize our updated fourth quarter financial guidance, reaffirming adjusted operating profit of $220 million to $240 million provided earlier this month. All metrics on this slide would be record quarterly highs and by significant margins, including free cash flow, which is projected to be between $250 million and $300 million. \n Of course, we still have to execute, and there is much work to be done to capture significant opportunity going forward, but as we have consistently communicated since the beginning of the year, this strong fourth quarter should provide a solid foundation for a very good 2023. This slide provides a lot of detail compared to last year's fourth quarter, and it captures the progress we have made in 12 months, notably the $135 million of incremental pricing.\n Despite this year-over-year improvement, probably more important for investors to understand the doability of the strong fourth quarter, is the incremental bridge from this year's third quarter, which we will cover in a couple of slides.\n Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our revised full year financial guidance, reconfirming adjusted operating profit of $450 million to $470 million provided earlier this month. As Rob mentioned in his key messages earlier, we are reducing full year free cash flow guidance by $125 million at the midpoint with approximately $60 million of that from changed expectations for year-end inventory, $30 million from lower expected EBITDA, and $30 million from lower expected cash collections.\n We had previously projected a more significant inventory reduction by year-end, but as we enter the fourth quarter with record projected sales volumes, and we anticipate continued strong volumes at the beginning of next year, we have reassessed those targets and will not press actions simply to hit a target.\n As mentioned, we have made good progress with SIOP, notably in the Americas. We have seen benefits from improved processes, and we still anticipate an inventory reduction at some point in 2023.\n Another driver of reduced full year free cash flow estimate is related to the delay of cash collection enhancements, including driving more significant advanced payments for large orders. This delay is temporal as we expect to see benefits from these actions in 2023.\n Nevertheless, fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to be a record quarterly high. $175 million was the previous high, and free cash flow will be an absolute focus for us in 2023. Certainly understanding that margin improvement will not translate into value creation unless we convert that into cash.\n Next, moving to Page 10. This is a format of a slide we shared back in August to provide transparency with our plan to achieve fourth quarter projections. The main drivers are similar to last time, with the most significant difference being the addition of some very volatile foreign exchange.\n The macro story is relatively straightforward outside of FX, our fourth quarter lift from third quarter should be driven by volume and price. We discussed the drivers of the volume increase last quarter, including the launch of our Monterrey facility, improving supply chain dynamics and normal favorable fourth quarter seasonality. The volume lift is more pronounced in the Americas and EMEA in the fourth quarter, but APAC is expecting a nice increase as well.\n Pricing is expected to provide an additional $40 million of operating profit in the fourth quarter with 80% of fourth quarter pricing already in backlog. Now of course, we still have to execute to achieve these strong results, but we certainly have clear line of sight to the fourth quarter performance, which we hope this slide demonstrates.\n Next, turning to Slide 11. We have very often discussed internally and externally, holding ourselves accountable to the quarterly sales and earnings profile we presented back in February. This slide visually captures what we said in February and how our results line up with that profile.\n February guidance is depicted with the bars, the blue being adjusted for foreign exchange. Our results, both actual and what we expect for the fourth quarter are depicted with the black line. As you can see, both sales and profitability trajectory profiles are very much consistent with our February guidance with our expected fourth quarter adjusted operating profit, when adjusted for foreign exchange, very consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year.\n So with that said, I now turn it back over to Dave Cote. Dave? Yes. Yes. Good question, Steve. This is David. I used to had to say this is David, because they would confuse Gary and my voice. I don't think they'll do that with Giordano.\n But -- so when you look at the progression of price through 2022, we consistently said we had to burn through the backlog that was included in pricing or the pricing that was in backlog at the end of '21. So I think 80% of our sales in the first quarter of this year, was in backlog at the end of '21. In the fourth quarter, only 20% of our sales will be in backlog from 2021.\n And as a result, you can see the significant increase in ramp-up of pricing during the year. So I think we had $40 million in Q1, and we'll have $135 million of year-over-year pricing in Q4.\n I don't want to say we've reached a level of stability with pricing, but certainly, as it translates into profitability in the P&L, the fourth quarter will really be that first quarter where we can demonstrate what we can do as it relates to pricing at the level that arguably, we probably should have been pricing at.\n So if you look at the wraparound impact for 2023 from pricing, and this just assumes that we keep the same pricing levels exiting Q4 into 2023, it's about $150 million to $200 million. We would expect to do better than that, because we continue with our pricing efforts.\n As it relates to inflation for next year, it's probably too soon. We certainly think there will be a year-over-year gross headwind from inflation. But from just about any perspective, we certainly would expect to be price cost positive next year, but probably too early to quantify what we think the impact will be for inflation. Yes. Probably too early to add a whole lot of detail to 2023. I know we put that $730 million to $750 million number out there at -- in August, and we reconfirm that. But as it relates to kind of filling in the details, it's probably too soon. And we'll provide a more robust bridge from '22 to '23 in February. Yes, Jeff, this is David. And there's still a ton of variables, and it's not only variables from a macro perspective, but within region. I think what we have said consistently over the last 2 or 3 quarters is that our issue is not a demand issue. The backlog is there. We have the orders. Probably the biggest risk is related to supply.\n And even though a lot of that supply has cleared up, notably with electronic components based on things we have done proactively, including qualifying new suppliers. And we talked a lot about the fan suppliers, but there still is a lot of volatility out there.\n And for a lot of these components, it's day-to-day, week-to-week. So we have better visibility than we had 60, 90 days ago. But I would still say there's risk as it relates to production and shipment. It's not necessarily a demand issue, I think we talked about fairly consistently. Yes, Scott, this is David. In some cases, yes. So we've included material cost escalation clauses in some of our master sales agreements. And -- but there are bands included in those. So it's not dollar for dollar, penny for penny, they have to expand either upwards or downwards outside of that band. And to some extent, there will be some pricing impact, but we don't consider that a significant risk heading into 2023. Yes. I'll start, Amit. So maybe I'd start with some facts. So our inventory level at the end of 2020 was about $450 million. We expect, at least on a GAAP basis, our inventory level at the end of this year will be around $765 million. So that's a $300 million increase in inventory, and that includes some foreign exchange benefit.\n So very clearly, inventory has increased each of the past 2 years. And very clearly at a level that is, as you say, in excess of what we need to run the business, we believe, on a go-forward basis.\n Now there are some contributory factors. Certainly, volume is significantly higher than it was when we exit 2020. And the supply chain has created many issues, not only for us, but many, many industrial companies out there.\n So it's hard at this point and probably premature to quantify what we think that benefit is, but it's something certainly we've been working on during the year. We could have probably taken that inventory level down a little bit lower at an exit point in 2022, but based on the significant volumes that we have to deliver this year and we anticipate heading into next year, we thought it prudent to not be overly aggressive.\n But with that said, because of the SIOP improvements, because some of the things we're doing with supply chain, we do believe there would be an inventory reduction at some point in 2023. Yes. So I think for the full year, our material and freight inflation number's $305 million. I think that's what you're referring to. About 80% of that is material and 20% is freight. And we include both spot buys and the material inflation and premium freight in the freight number.\n And we, too, are seeing some of the favorable benefits of freight rates. I would say 90% of what we do is on contract as opposed to spot. So we won't see the benefit immediately, but we also have adjustment clauses in those contracts, which should favorably benefit us over time. And we would say certainly at the beginning of 2023. Yes. So I think in the last presentation, we spelled out full year expectations by quarter for adjusted operating margin by region. We did not include that in this quarter, and we knew somebody would ask about it.\n So we have the numbers ready. Yes. So Americas, we're targeting about 20%. That's about 400 basis point lift from Q3. EMEA, and this is based on the expectation of being price cost positive in Q4, and also the benefit of volume leverage, we anticipate adjusted operating profit in EMEA to be in the mid-20s. So call it, 24%, 25%.\n So down from what we had previously disclosed because of the additional inflation that we talked about, but still, a significant increase from what we saw in Q3 and a very significant increase from what we saw in Q4 of last year. And APAC, we would anticipate being relatively flat in Q4 versus Q3. Yes. So I think organic growth for total Vertiv in Q4 would be 25%. And you got to take a step back and realize you're saying 25%. That's a big number. There is some divergence across the regions. I would say, certainly highest in the Americas, and that could be 30% to 40% increase driven by both volume and price. EMEA year-over-year is probably in the mid-20s. And I would say, APAC is probably up about 10%. Our goal would be to maintain profitability regardless of what happened to the top line. Our industry is certainly different than others. No one's recession-proof, but based on the size of our backlog heading into next year. And we certainly don't think the recession impact on use of data and building data centers is certainly going to be perfectly correlated for next year.\n So even in a recession, we feel pretty good about our top line. But if there are headwinds with the top line that roll through variable contribution margins, we'll take the necessary steps from a fixed cost basis to offset it. And our goal would be to maintain that $730 million to $750 million adjusted operating profit outlook regardless of any impact from the recession. Yes. Thanks, Mark. I would say from a strategic perspective, we're more excited about E&I and the positive contributions to Vertiv today than we were at the time of the acquisition. And part of the value equation there was based on revenue synergies. And I would say, our expectation for revenue synergies are probably 3x, if not more, what we had initially anticipated.\n Now unfortunately, that's not showing up in the numbers this year. So my depiction of E&I, probably rather crudely is a bad year, great acquisition. A lot of the issues that E&I is seeing from a profitability perspective this year are identical with what we have seen with Vertiv.\n So if you look at the operating profit margin profile quarter-over-quarter this year, I think it started at low teens in Q1, maybe 14%, and it should exit the year closer to 20%. And the story is similar. Inflation hit with a pretty good-sized backlog at the end of last year, and we were just a little bit slow in getting price. And if you look at the price we get in the fourth quarter, that's what really increases the margin from that low teens to 20%.\n So I would say, we are more excited today than we were at the time of the acquisition, and sometimes we get asked with if you had to do it all over again, would you still do the deal. And the answer is a very profound robust, absolutely. No. It would be really tough to quantify what the impact is. I mean, certainly greater than 0. And we're not talking tens of millions, right? So you see the size of our backlog, it continues to grow. And we think, we see the benefit of some of the very proactive actions we've taken during the year to address the issue. We see that in the fourth quarter. But you can't go back in time and fix the situation in Q2 and Q3.\n So it's in the hundreds of millions, if you look at lost revenue earlier in the year. That's kind of a ballpark. There's a lot of -- that's a multivariable equation, but suffice it to say, it has been very significant. Yes. It took the last question, Andrew. So good question. And we don't want to necessarily elaborate too much. The folks at this call, certainly on third quarter earnings. But I would say, we're actually very excited to welcome a new shareholder, a very large shareholder.\n A shareholder, who certainly, as they communicated their investment thesis, very consistent with our management thesis. And that is as a company operating in a great industry like we do, with the continued operational improvements and some of the things that Gio mentioned with a focus on developing a high-performance culture.\n There's considerable, considerable value here to unlock and it's all the things we've been saying over the last year or so. Their investment doesn't change our strategy or our priorities. Our interests are aligned, just like with any other shareholder. And as we execute and perform going forward, our interests certainly will continue to be aligned."

            "name": "Rob Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Starting with some key messages on Slide 3. We anticipated the volume ramp up in the back half of 2022 and we're certainly seeing it, with organic net sales up 20% in the third quarter, orders, excluding FX, were up 15%, which is even better than our preliminary orders number we provided earlier this month. We continue to see strong long-term market demand signals from our customers.\n Adjusted operating profit of $134 million was within the guidance range. Our improvement actions are taking hold, and we've seen the improvement building sequentially throughout the year. We delivered again on our price plan, realizing $110 million of price this quarter, and we raised our full year pricing expectations to $365 million.\n We saw price cost split $35 million year-over-year tailwind for this quarter. This tailwind will further strengthen into the fourth quarter and into 2023. Supply chain has improved over the last 90 days, even in some areas that have been hampering this, areas like circuit breakers, fans, and other certain electronic categories.\n Our work qualifying alternative suppliers is paying off, and these additional sources of supply support our fourth quarter volume projections. That being said, there are certain categories of power electronics that are still in short supply, and we expect them to remain so throughout at least mid-2023.\n Free cash flow is trending in the right direction, although we continue to carry high levels of inventory to support our increasing volume as fourth quarter is expected to be a record sales quarter for Vertiv. Orders have remained high, which is a great thing, but it has us carrying more inventory than expected.\n Fourth quarter free cash flow is expected to be an all-time record between $250 million and $300 million positive. And this should set us up, we think, for a great '23. We know our working capital is not optimized, and we are taking the full year projection down from our prior guidance, but we believe there is a significant additional cash benefit in 2023 and we have been working on plans and programs to make sure this happens.\n We are affirming the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance of $230 million at the midpoint, which continues to support our view of a very strong fourth quarter and we believe a very good position and very well for 2023.\n Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in our markets by region. A few changes in Americas market view. Enterprise has moved to yellow, indicating a bit of caution, but is consistent with what we've been seeing in other global regions. The Enterprise market is exhibiting more caution given to the macro uncertainty, including the possibility of a recession, but still remains positive.\n The Communication market in Americas has been very strong for a number of quarters, and there's been a lot of investment associated with 5G technology cycle. While it's coming off those high marks, telecom carriers still invest, both in new technology and their existing network infrastructure. EMEA and Asia markets views remain relatively healthy as well. All in all, strong market backdrop continued for what we do.\n To note, we have been aggressive with our pricing actions for several quarters now, and we continue to see strong demand. We can get price and the ability has been demonstrated each quarter as we make our way through the year.\n Moving to Slide 5. We still feel good about customer demand with orders up 15% in the quarter, excluding FX, and that is compared to last year's third quarter, where orders were up 17% from the prior year. We have highlighted that we anticipate year-over-year orders declining in Q4. That is more a product of a challenging comparison to the prior year. If you recall, orders were up 51% in the same period last year.\n Fourth quarter orders, adjusted FX, are expected to be relatively flat in line with third quarter orders. We posted another record-breaking backlog at the end of September of $4.7 billion, which provides great support as we think about our 2023 top line. We continue to execute on our pricing plan and have delivered pricing consistent with our framework each quarter in 2022.\n Our pricing plan of $135 million for fourth quarter includes, 80% already in the backlog and 20% to be realized on book and ship, but those actions have already taken place. We are clearly demonstrating we can get price in our markets.\n Supply chain has been improving, clearly not without disruption, but seeing things improve. Improving external market conditions, coupled with the extensive work the team has been doing to qualify new suppliers is helping our situation. The one area that is still tight in some of the semiconductor categories we specifically use.\n We use specialized high-end semiconductors different from some of the categories where you've seen in the market, a nice improvement on those. While availability is slightly improving for us in the specialized categories, we expect this tightness in the markets to continue through at least mid-'23.\n Some good news as it relates to our fan supplier. They are fully qualified and shipping production parts to us. There is favorability in the commodity and freight markets. We typically have 1 quarter lag before that reads through our P&L, but we anticipate seeing more favorability in fourth quarter and going on into 2023.\n Even with some good news at our back, we did raise the inflation estimate for the year by $15 million, with $5 million being realized in Q3, and $10 million anticipated in Q4. This is related to 2 primary factors: one, our regional sales mix is more heavily weighted to higher inflation zones. And we're also seeing some additional inflation in EMEA, mainly related to energy costs.\n In summary, our markets remain healthy. While recession proof is a strong term, there is an argument to be made, as Dave said, data will continue to grow through these economic cycles. That data has to be networked, has to be stored, and has to be processed in data centers where our equipment is. We are the market and technology leaders, and we are getting paid for what we do.\n Supply chain pressures, as I mentioned earlier, are easing, and we're seeing that benefit and expect that to continue to improve. Coupled with the work we have done to onboard new suppliers, we are proving operationally each quarter, and you're seeing it in our financial performance.\n Now I'll turn the call over to David to walk us through the financials. David? Thank you very much, and thank you, everyone, for your time today. As this is my last earnings call, as CEO of Vertiv, I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge and thank a few people.\n And I'd like to start with Platinum Equity for creating this opportunity and believing in me and supporting us through the turnaround of this great company. I certainly want to thank our customers. I know we've cost pain over the last year, but we're working through that and thank you for sticking with us and sticking loyal to our brand.\n The employees for all the work you've done and all the work you're going to have to do going forward. We've got a great '23 to look forward to. So I want to thank the employees, the Board of Directors with a special thanks to Dave Cote for the support and the mentoring and coaching. And of course, I want to thank all the shareowners for their support in Vertiv now and going forward.\n It's been an honor serving as CEO, and I'm more confident now than ever. The future of Vertiv and its ability to create long-term value for the stakeholders is the brightest days are ahead, and you're in great hands with Giordano as we go forward.\n So again, thank you for the opportunity to serve you."

            "content": "Our third quarter performance continues to support the profile of improvement that we presented in February of this year. Our financial performance escalated in the third quarter, as we anticipated, helped by a record level of price that was realized this quarter.\n We are doing things differently, especially in the Americas, and we are seeing that translate to an improved financial performance. I know demand is becoming a bigger question for all companies given the macroeconomic environment. Demand win was strong for Vertiv, the data center end market as a true secular demand story, data is just going to continue to grow.\n We continue to execute on operational improvements and I'm pleased to report good progress in Americas reflected in the adjusted operating margins improvement.\n The work in the Americas is far from done, but there are very encouraging signs. Our operational focus is paying off, and we anticipate this will be visible in our Q4 results in the Americas.\n We have another significant step-up in operational performance planned for this quarter. Similar to our last earnings call, David will walk you through in detail why we believe this will happen, and it will sound very consistent with our previous discussion.\n We made an announcement earlier this month on our CEO Succession Plan. Giordano Albertazzi is the name COO in addition to his duties as America's President till, we find a replacement, and will succeed Rob Johnson as the CEO on January 1 next year.\n I work closely with Gio and feel confident, he brings the right leadership and experience to drive Vertiv's performance. Anand, again, thank Rob for all he has done as CEO over the past 6 years in building Vertiv's strong competitive position and foundation for sustained growth.\n As we are in the final quarter of this year, I know attention is focused squarely on the setup for 2023. We've provided adjusted operating profit guidance earlier than usual for 2023 that represents a 60% increase over our current guidance for 2022.\n People have asked about our visibility given the world is a complicated place right now. While visibility isn't perfect, the management team feels confident in their ability to execute and deliver Q4 and what it portends for 2023, which should be a very good year for Vertiv and for our shareholders.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. Hang on. 2.5 years of working remotely, and I still can't remember to hit the unmute button.\n I said a few things about Gio in my opening remarks, but I'd like to expand on that a bit. Gio is an industry veteran. He's an operator at [indiscernible] and he's been with Vertiv for over 24 years, serving in a variety of operational capacities and really given the terrific background to run a company. He drove significant operational and financial improvements while leading EMEA, tripling the adjusted operating profit in that region to over 18% in a 3-year period ending in '21.\n And we're seeing the early stages of a turnaround story shaping the Americas, where margin has sequentially been increasing. The SIOP process has been greatly improved. And a focus on creating a high-performing culture is apparent within the organization. He knows a lot about the industry and has a track record of performance in both Europe and the Americas, which together represent about 70% of Vertiv sales.\n His broad operational background and that success uniquely positioned him to turn Vertiv into a high-performing business. He is the right person to lead this company and at the right time. So I ask Gio to talk a bit about his work on the Americas, the key initiatives underway, and to provide some early thoughts on 2023 that provide an introduction -- a better introduction to all of you of our incoming CEO. So, Gio?"

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Nadia. Good morning and welcome to Vertiv's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem.\n Before we begin, I point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings with the SEC.\n Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: As I mentioned on our previous calls, we're taking 2022 a quarter at a time with an escalating performance profile as price increases realized. It has taken time to work our way through the backlog, but as we do, performance escalates. The profile will look exactly the same as we outlined in February, but in substance, the story and performance are in line with that profile.\n End-market demand remains robust. Our order rates reflect this strength. And as market leaders in these spaces, we are furthering the gap by accelerating our new product introductions. We also continue addressing the operational areas, particularly in the Americas, that have caused shortfalls historically. While there are still some improvements to work through, the SIOP process in Americas under the leadership of Giordano Albertazzi is better aligned than ever. There is still work to do, but certainly, it is in a much better place and continuing to improve.\n There are other process improvements also being addressed by the new management team in the Americas. They are getting after challenging areas that have really become apparent during these recent periods of high volatility. The new management team is doing exactly what we need them to do: cleaning these up and resetting the base for a great runway ahead in the fourth quarter and 2023 in a very profitable part of the business, the Americas.\n Third quarter is expected to be a sequential step-up in performance followed by another expected large step up for Q4. I know some of you may question our ability to deliver the second half as presented in our guidance, especially a significant fourth quarter. But the team will walk you through why and how we believe that will happen as price realization improves and supply improves with newly qualified suppliers.\n We remain on pace to achieve a significant step-up in financial performance that supports the earnings profile we presented at in February. End markets remain strong, inflation is starting to moderate. We are navigating supply chain challenges and bringing additional suppliers online, and price is sticking. With the anticipated performance profile, we expect that 2023 can be a very good year for Vertiv and our shareholders.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thank you, Dave. Q2 was another step forward in delivering on our commitments for 2022. Starting with some of the key messages on Slide 3. Demand continues at a pace I've not seen in the 30 years of my career in this market. Orders were up 17% in second quarter, 11% from volume and 10% from higher prices with a 4% deduct for foreign exchange. Our customers are focused on securing supply in a tight market, and we see that both in our orders and backlog, which firms up the demand outlook well into 2023.\n Our adjusted operating profit exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to work through a number of key actions for improvement. But where we have fully implemented change, we are seeing the benefits take hold. Key among them is our pricing performance. We have proved to ourselves and now, hopefully, to you, our investors, that we are a business that can get price. Our pricing plan remains at $360 million for the full year.\n Supply chain continues to be challenging, but we've made very good progress in securing qualified second and third sources of supply for key components, and we'll start seeing the benefit from that activity in Q3 and more fully in Q4. Our new thermal facility in Monterrey, Mexico has started production, and we have a new fan supplier coming online that has committed to help us meet the significant demand we are seeing across the thermal management market.\n Our work qualifying new suppliers is not only limited to fans. We have also qualified new breaker manufacturers, semiconductor suppliers and other suppliers. While there's still more work to do, we have been very aggressive in our actions to manage the challenging supply chain environment, most notably in the electronic components.\n In light of the supply change conditions and in conjunction with the expected significant sales increase in the second half of the year, we have not been able to reduce inventory as quickly or as significantly as we anticipated and communicated to you earlier in this year. While we're expected to use cash in the second quarter, it was larger than we anticipated. Although there should be an improvement in the next 6 months, we are reducing our full year expectations for free cash flow to a range of $25 million of use to $25 million of cash generation.\n As Dave mentioned, we made significant progress in our SIOP process globally, but we are especially happy with the progress that we've made in Americas and believe, based on these improved processes, inventory reduction should be a significant source of cash flow in 2023. While there are many moving pieces, we provided updated guidance for our adjusted operating profit, reducing the midpoint by $25 million. We have provided a detailed bridge on the changes on these slides on Slide 12 that David Fallon will cover shortly. There is some rebalancing between third and fourth quarter. But in aggregate, we are still on pace to deliver a very strong second half with a noticeable step-up across key financial metrics.\n Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in the market by region. No change in our view across our end markets versus what we saw in April. They are still quite healthy and very strong. Cloud and colocation remain robust. You've seen this in the cloud growth rates reported by all major cloud providers. AWS reported last week that their cloud business increased 33% in the second quarter and believes that we are still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector cloud adoption. Certainly, the growth in cloud market supports this view. Data growth is not slowing down.\n Our view on the enterprise and small to medium business remained consistent from Q1, and we believe edge applications will continue to provide growth and lift for these markets. The communication market continues to see 5G investment, and we're aligned with all the relevant players in this space.\n In the commercial and industrial market, vital applications continue to drive growth and opportunities for Vertiv. The market outlook remains very healthy. It is likely our year-over-year order growth rate will moderate in the second half as the comparisons to prior year will be difficult. But I want to reiterate the end markets we play in continue to be very, very good shape.\n Moving on to Slide 5. Customer demand remains strong. Our order rate and backlog are a clear demonstration of this strength. We are delivering on our price plan and have implemented price actions needed to deliver the second half pricing plans, including that on our book-and-ship business.\n As I said earlier, supply chain continues to be challenging, especially in electronics. We do not expect this to abate in 2022, and we anticipate that we will see pressure at least through the first half of 2023. We have incurred higher costs for electronic components since we had to go to the spot market to secure some of that supply.\n In addition, material and freight inflation was higher as absolute dollars for the second quarter, but generally in line with the -- adjusted for the higher volume. We have started to see some relief in commodity and freight markets. We typically see a benefit on this on a quarter lag, but expected to provide a nice tailwind for us as we go into 2023. We've made good progress in qualifying additional suppliers on key components and should start seeing additional supply hit our factories in late Q3 and further into Q4. This provides support to our volume assumptions for the ramp in Q3 and Q4.\n We have to add some fixed costs sooner than anticipated to support the volume lift in areas such as our new thermal plant in Monterrey, Mexico. In summary, the market remains strong. Supply chain is still complex, but we are getting to the implementation phase for the new suppliers that should help alleviate sourcing pressures on the most critical components.\n With that, I'll now turn it over to David to walk us through the financials. David? \nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results. As you can see, net sales increased 11% from last year's second quarter, and we're up 8% organically, including 2% from volume and 6% from price. The E&I acquisition added $114 million in net sales and was partially offset by a $60 million FX headwind, more than 70% of that headwind in EMEA. And we also had a headwind related to the divestiture of our industrial UPS business in EMEA, and that was a $17 million headwind.\n Pricing added $80 million in the quarter, which was in line with guidance and double what we saw in the first quarter as we continue to burn through the lower-priced backlog and recognize more sales booked after we implemented substantial price increases late last year and earlier this year. Adjusted operating profit of $82 million exceeded the midpoint of guidance, but was $52 million lower than last year's second quarter.\n We list some of the components of this reduction at the bottom of the page. But in summary, there was $11 million -- or $10 million unfavorable price/cost; and $45 million headwind from FX and other, including a $10 million foreign exchange headwind; $10 million from direct labor, inflation and inefficiency, in part driven by the supply chain challenges; and approximately $20 million from cost headwinds in the Americas, primarily related to customer support costs, our sales incentive compensation program and several other drivers.\n We expect to see continued year-over-year cost headwinds in the Americas in the third quarter, but we believe we have identified and addressed most of these issues as we will enter the fourth quarter and transition into 2023. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.10 for the quarter, which was in line with guidance. Second quarter free cash flow was negative $232 million. While we expected a net use of cash, it was certainly higher than we anticipated.\n As Rob mentioned, we have not reduced inventory consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year, in part due to continued supply chain challenges, but also in preparation for the significant volume ramp in the second half of the year. We are improving our SIOP processes globally. And as Dave mentioned, notably in the Americas, and we expect to receive an inventory free cash flow dividend at some point in 2023.\n Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. We saw a sequential quarterly improvement in organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin across all 3 regions. The Americas region grew organically 6.6% or $37 million with most of that growth coming from price. We do anticipate more balance between price and volume in Americas in the second half of 2022, including mid-teen year-over-year volume growth as we continue to qualify new suppliers and launch the Monterrey facility.\n Americas adjusted operating profit of $82 million was negatively impacted year-over-year by price/cost, higher fixed costs, including to support the volume ramp-up in the second half and additional cost headwinds we referenced on the previous slide. In APAC, organic sales increased 5.9% despite the China COVID lockdowns, which we estimate lowered second quarter sales by approximately $30 million. Notwithstanding the impact of the lockdowns, adjusted operating profit for APAC was actually higher than our expectations as we were able to drive higher sales in other APAC subregions while managing fixed costs.\n Finally, we continue to see strong growth in EMEA with organic sales up 13.3% with a good balance between volume and price. While inflation accelerated in the second quarter from the first quarter, so did our pricing. Our second quarter net price/cost in EMEA, while still a headwind, was less of a headwind than what we saw in Q1, and we expect price/cost to be a significant tailwind in the second half of the year.\n Moving to Slide 8, we summarize our updated third quarter guidance, which is about $50 million lower at the midpoint than our previous guidance. This slide summarizes third quarter versus last year, but likely more pertinent is an analysis of the changes from our previous guidance, which we provide in a couple of slides. Despite the reduction, third quarter guidance still reflects a material sequential step-up from the second quarter across all of our key financial metrics with organic sales expected to be up approximately $100 million, 70% of that volume, and adjusted operating profit expected to be up almost $60 million at the midpoint. Despite the reduction from our prior guidance, our third quarter expectations return us to an adjusted operating profit level from last year's third quarter and will serve as a strong bridge to a substantial improvement in the fourth quarter and transition us into a very strong 2023.\n Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our revised full year financial guidance, which reflects the $37.5 million lower adjusted operating profit at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. Once again, we provide detail of this reduction on Slide 10, the next page. But from a macro perspective, it is driven by a $25 million foreign exchange headwind and an additional $12.5 million net from additional cost wins in various categories, partially offset by the benefit from incremental sales volume. And more on this on the next slide. But as Rob mentioned at the outset, as it relates to free cash flow, we are reducing our full year guidance to a range of positive $25 to negative $25 million in part due to lower expected adjusted operating profit, but probably more significantly from changed expectations with our expected inventory reduction.\n We continue to improve our SIOP processes in what is a very challenging supply chain environment. And we're encouraged that these improved processes will result in much improved inventory management, but the timing of the inventory reduction benefits will likely be pushed into 2023. Nonetheless, we are still anticipating significant improvements in free cash flow in the second half of the year and -- notably in the fourth quarter.\n Now turning to Slide 10. We provide additional detail underlying changes from our previous guidance. As you can see on the slide, foreign currency translation, certainly driven by the strengthening U.S. dollar, negatively impacted net sales by approximately $160 million for the full year and adjusted operating profit by approximately $25 million. We include some additional information on our foreign currency exposure on Page 27 in the appendix in this package. But just as a broad overview, over 50% of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the euro and British pound have been more acute than other currencies. And as a result, over 70% of our negative FX impact is in EMEA.\n Moving on. Incremental volume is expected to generate an additional $230 million of sales, $100 million of that was in the second quarter, and these sales translate into $82 million of adjusted operating profit for the full year. And there is a pronounced increase in volume in the fourth quarter as we've increased sales expectations, primarily in the Americas based upon our success in qualifying new suppliers and, of course, the launch of the Monterrey facility.\n Material inflation is up $20 million from our previous guidance, $10 million in each Q2 and Q3, primarily driven by continued higher costs for electronic components and spot buys. We anticipate this pressure to ease somewhat heading into the fourth quarter as we continue to bring additional suppliers into our supply chain. We have reduced profit expectations for E&I for the full year by about $12 million. This is mostly driven by timing as shipments have shifted to the right and into 2023. But that business continues to improve, and the demand environment continues to be strong with backlog at E&I up over 60% from year-end 2021, which portends significant sales and profitability improvement heading into 2023.\n We have increased our fixed cost estimates for the year by approximately $30 million. Most of this driven by timing as we anticipate adding some of these fixed costs in early 2023, but we accelerated the timing to support the higher volume in the second half and for early 2023. Some of these higher fixed costs are also related to IT spending as we continue to optimize our ERP system in the Americas.\n And last on this chart are other cost headwinds, primarily in the Americas, and as we mentioned, associated with any number of underlying factors, most of which we believe are transitory and addressable and should be mitigated as we enter the fourth quarter and pivot into 2023.\n So in summary, on this slide, current full year guidance is about $37 million lower than prior guidance at the midpoint, $25 million of that related to FX with $50 million of $37 million reduction in the third quarter, offset by an $11 million increase in the fourth quarter and, of course, the $2 million beat in the second quarter.\n Next, turning to Slide 11. We provide a sequential bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter for both net sales and adjusted operating profit, a $220 million increase in net sales and a $113 million increase in adjusted operating profit. We understand that based upon our fourth quarter last year, there may be some concerns with our ability to deliver a robust fourth quarter this year. To help allay these potential concerns, we provide this bridge, which quantifies the sources of the uplift.\n First, the higher volume is certainly supported by improved visibility in the sourcing. And as we've mentioned, the launch of the Monterrey facility. In addition, it's very important to understand, we normally have a seasonal volume ramp from third quarter to fourth quarter. The $35 million sequential pricing benefit is driven by the continued burn of lower-priced backlog in previous quarters with a vast majority of our fourth quarter shipments from higher-priced orders from late 2021 and early 2022. We anticipate approximately $10 million additional adjusted operating profit from E&I in the fourth quarter, primarily from incremental volume, which should flow through at higher margins, pursuant to improve pricing, similar dynamic for the base Vertiv business. And finally, as we discussed on the prior slide, other is driven by the ramp down in the Americas cost headwinds partially offset by additional fixed costs.\n So in summary, the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance of $253 million at the midpoint certainly represents a substantial quarter for us, especially considering the $13 million adjusted operating profit in the first quarter and the $82 million in the second quarter. However, we believe we are addressing 2 of the most pressing issues that drove lower firsthand -- first half performance: pricing and supply chain constraints. And we have visibility and confidence in our ability to deliver these fourth quarter projections.\n On the following slide, so Slides 12 through 14, we will continue to be transparent with our communications around our plan and provide additional details for the second half. In February, we laid out an aggressive but achievable plan through the first 6 months. Our high-level scorecard reflects $91 million higher sales, $25 million higher adjusted operating profit, $10 million higher pricing and $5 million lower inflation. And likely more important, our expectations for the fourth quarter have not significantly changed from the beginning of the year.\n On Page 12, this illustrates our current quarterly sales guidance at the top of the slide and our prior April guidance at the bottom. There's certainly a lot of numbers on this slide. I won't go through each and every one of them. But of note, on the right, is the increased volume growth from our previous guidance, higher across all 3 regions, but most certainly, most significant in the Americas as we have referenced.\n Turning to Page 13. This slide summarizes our updated quarterly adjusted operating profit and margin guidance, a similar construct to the previous slide with current guidance at the top and the April guidance at the bottom. We've already discussed changes in guidance and the step-up from the third quarter to a fourth quarter that would be a record high and by a wide margin for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%.\n Finally for me, for prepared remarks on Slide 14, we show the expected quarterly 2022 progression of our regional adjusted operating margins. We have primarily focused externally on the recovery plan for the Americas. But as reflected on this slide, there is expected sequential quarterly adjusted operating margin improvement across all 3 regions. And even though not depicted on this slide, the same is true for E&I. The scale of the improvement is more significant in the Americas than EMEA as they were more impacted by inflation than APAC. But these charts illustrate that the entire Vertiv global team is driving improved execution. Clearly, we are focused on unlocking value on a global basis, and we know you are watching closely, and we'll continue to be very transparent with the status of our progress.\n With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. \nRob Johnson: Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 15, where we provide our expectations for market conditions over the next 18 months or so. And we share many of the drivers of optimism for 2023 that portends to be a very strong year. First, you've heard us comment on several times on the strength of the market we serve. All major cloud companies are growing strongly and continue to invest. Colocation utilization rates continue to be high. Edge demand and 5G rollouts will continue, and we are very well positioned to win on both of those fronts.\n While we are certainly mindful of the possibilities of a recession, we don't think that blunts the growth of data, certainly not in the near term or intermediate term. In fact, business could likely utilize more data in ways to enrich their business models and gain productivity across their operations in the face of recessionary conditions.\n In summary, our demand remains strong. We are currently filling our backlog for the second half of the -- for next year, and we expect these favorable conditions to continue. On the right-hand side of this slide, we provide a quick list of reasons to be optimistic about 2023. Our fourth quarter is shaping up consistent with our beginning-of-the-year expectations with pricing actions not only returning profitability to where we were prior to the challenging supply chain and inflationary environment but to a higher level.\n In fact, we believe we are in a -- we are a much stronger company today and we'll be a much stronger company tomorrow because of these events over the last 12 months and the results we are very encouraged with that we see for 2023. Although we are not prepared to provide a lot of detail into 2023 expectations, we still need to execute and deliver Q3 and Q4, and there's plenty of uncertainty with supply chain and inflation.\n To give everyone something to work with for next year, we directionally expect that our adjusted operating profit to be 50% higher in 2023 than in 2022. Of course, there are still a lot of moving pieces, and we will know more and we'll update this expectation after our third and fourth quarters. So please view this as a preliminary guidepost as we look forward to a strong 2023.\n Finally, on Slide 16 and again, the summary of our key messages for today. Sitting here 1 quarter further into 2022, I feel more strongly than ever that the process improvements we've made and implementing throughout the year give us the ability and the consistency to get price, coupled with the corrective actions we've taken in the Americas, are going to result in a very, very successful future for Vertiv. Without a doubt, the proof will be in the back half of 2022. I pledge to you that we are committed to executing well and transparently communicating our progress.\n With that said, I want to thank our employees, our Board members for your continued support in our organization as we continue to make significant strides forward.\n I will now turn the call over to the operator who will open up the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: There's a lot to chew through here, for sure. So just wanted to run through -- you mentioned some of the cost headwinds in Q2 leaking through to Q3 and then improving into Q4. I thought maybe you could just dive a little bit deeper on that. You mentioned some of the cost headwinds in the Americas at the Monterrey facility, et cetera. So maybe if you can just run through that quickly, that would be awesome. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Nigel. This is David. So there's really 2 categories, and we try to break those out on Slide 10. But the first category is related to fixed costs. And these are certainly tied, although not completely tied, to additional cost to support the second half ramp up in volume. And some of these costs we anticipated to add at the beginning of 2023, but we brought them forward. Most of these are plant-related costs, but also includes some engineering costs related to the qualifying of new vendors and parts.\n But I think there's probably a question if these would create a tail or a headwind for 2023. I think that $15 million we're expecting in Q4, you annualize that to $60 million versus the $30 million for this year would imply a $30 million headwind. Some of these costs certainly are one-time-related to support either a hard ramp in a plant like Monterrey or a soft ramp in many of the other plants that are seeing high volumes. So I would not anticipate to see a significant year-over-year headwind related to fixed costs in 2023.\n The other cost headwinds bucket, which we estimate at about $18 million in Q2, $15 million in Q3, we truly believe these are transitory. These are very specific issues. We mentioned a couple of them in the slide deck: customer support costs, also higher costs related to the sales incentive plan. These are -- and there's a host of other issues that Gio and his team have been identifying and addressing over the last 2 quarters or so. And we believe we have them identified. They'll continue to present a headwind in Q3, but we believe these should be fully resolved in Q4 and from a year-over-year basis actually provide a nice year-over-year tailwind for 2023. \nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. And I just wanted to -- just curious on the material inflation. You've got a $10 million clip to both Q2, Q3, and then that's neutral in Q4. Is that just kind of a more normalized purchasing pattern combined with some of these new suppliers on chips? I mean, any color there? \nDavid Fallon: No. You're absolutely right. I think we've seen a little bit of stability, although there continues to be variability as it relates to electronic components. Inflation there certainly is higher than we anticipated heading into the quarter. I think the light at the end of the tunnel is related to the new supplier qualifications that we're seeing that should come online in the fourth quarter.\n So I think if you look at the ramp-up of new inflation, I think we saw $15 million in Q1. That ramped to $40 million in Q2, and we anticipate that $40 million of new inflation will remain consistent in Q3. And we actually have implied in our guidance a $5 million dip in Q4. But still subject to change. There's still a lot of uncertainty and challenges with the electronic components, we're still relying to a certain extent on spot buys, but we believe we've taken some really proactive steps and initiatives to address that higher -- those higher costs we're paying and primarily through qualifying new suppliers. \nNigel Coe: My follow-on is the free cash flow in the second half of the year. You mentioned the SIOPs improving in 2023. Just wondering the degree of confidence in executing on the second half free cash plan. And then perhaps more importantly, going into 2023, you mentioned an inventory free dividend in '23. Does that suggest that you're confident in your converting over 100% in '23? \nDavid Fallon: Probably not prepared to commit on a free cash flow conversion for next year, but we certainly are optimistic. Our beginning-of-the-year guidance for inventory actually assumed a $50 million reduction from end of year 2021. And that's a 2021 year-end number. That was actually up fairly significantly from the end of 2020.\n Yes, in reality, we'll probably build inventory by about $100 million again in 2022. That's $150 million delta, and there's other moving pieces. But that effectively explains the takedown in the full -- for the full year number from $150 million to about 0 at midpoint. There is definitely opportunity as it relates to optimizing our inventory levels. We are very confident that we are executing towards that opportunity through our SIOP processes. And I would be very optimistic that we should have a reduction -- a real reduction in inventory or certainly from a DIO perspective in 2023. So we refer to that internally as a dividend, and it should not only create a very nice one-time benefit from that reduction in 2023, but certainly on an ongoing basis as we look at our [indiscernible]. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. \nScott Davis: I wanted to talk a little bit about the Monterrey facility, if you will, because this is a new thing perhaps. But is the Monterrey facility replacing some higher-cost capacity in addition to creating new capacity? And can you just give us a little bit of color on why it's needed? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Scott, sure. We've seen a large uptick in our thermal business, especially with some of the innovative solutions that we've delivered. So it's really complementing. We're not shutting down any other capacity. It's really additional capacity for the additional volume that we're seeing. So we're -- this is something we've been planning for a while, and we think Monterrey is a great place to be from a cost perspective. But it is really to help the ramp and the demand that we see and the backlog that we have in our thermal business. \nScott Davis: Okay. Just to back up a little bit. There was -- the Vertiv story was always pitched as holding fixed cost steady, which is the Dave Cote playbook. You wrote a book on it. And now I think we've had multiple quarters in a row of not holding fixed costs. So are we going to be back on that in 2023? I mean, where do you guys stand? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Scott. Oh, no. It's a great question. No. And Scott, I can assure you that's not the first time that, that question was asked. It's certainly been a focus here internally. We are still absolutely committed to holding fixed cost constant on a year-over-year basis going forward. The added fixed cost that we're seeing here in 2022, we -- that is more from a timing perspective. These are fixed costs that we had anticipated adding in the first half of 2023.\n Just to put these fixed costs in perspective and the need for the timing, our second quarter sales at an annual run rate were about $5.6 billion. That's ramping up to $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. And so we continue to focus on fixed costs. I think we have seen increases over the last couple of years, but most of those increases are pursuant to operations and higher capacity and also ER&D.\n I can tell you, our administrative functions are absolutely constant from a fixed cost basis in 2023 versus -- or in 2022 versus 2021 and will continue to be. But we are selective with fixed costs. And to the extent that it creates a future return, including R&D and from an operational perspective, we'll choose from a timing perspective to sometimes accelerate those. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: I also wanted to touch on Monterrey -- just wondering on Monterrey, how critical this capacity is to meeting the top line forecast here for the year. Is it -- and is the plant actually up and running and delivering commercial product yet? So kind of a second part to the first question is, are we on a ramp where we've got visibility of getting the revenues we need out of that plant in the back half? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Jeff, this is Rob. Yes, Monterrey, first of all, is up and operating. It delivered even in Q2 some products to our customers. So we are shipping, and we are in the middle of a ramp with that going into Q3 and then a steeper ramp going into Q4. As long as we get the supply, we feel confident with the way that plant is operating. And it is needed to provide the necessary volume increase more so in Q4 for us. But we feel confident with the team. They've spent a lot of time down there. And so far so good with the product coming out of the plant right now. \nJeffrey Sprague: Great. And also just on the cost side, what exactly is this customer support cost that you're talking about? Is this expedited freight? Is it allowances? What actually is going on there? And what's the visibility of that moderating? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Jeff, this is David. So it's a combination of things. And one example, we had to rent a crane to facilitate the installation of product into a customer site. So we continue to focus on our customers, and in some cases, we'll actually foot the bill as it relates to hitting timing. Some of those customers' store costs are also pursuant to late deliveries. And in some cases, our contracts include penalties if we don't deliver product in the agreed amount of time.\n So a lot of these things are certainly tied into the supply chain. We're still kind of day to day as it relates to supply, which creates a lot of uncertainty with delivery. And some points, we just have to catch up and spend some of our own money to hit some promised customer delivery dates. So the reason this is tied into the new supply is a lot of those pressures should go away as we continue to qualify new investors. And when you can spread that risk over 3 or 4 vendors as opposed to 1 or 2, it really helps planning out a plant and a delivery schedule, and we think a significant amount of these costs should go away. \nJeffrey Sprague: And sort of on that front, one last one for me and I'll pass it, just also kind of the internal operations of the company as it relates to systems and ERP. You mentioned still working on that. Maybe just an update on what needs to be accomplished and to what degree, if any. Is it still somewhat of a restraint on orders, delivery, operations, what have you? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I would say we are over the significant launch hurdle that you get with a lot of ERPs. That certainly created noise in the fourth quarter, early first quarter. We have a fully functioning system. It's not perfect, not many ERPs are a year after launch. But in conjunction with some of the issues that we have identified in the Americas over the first 6 months, and we're still identifying, we've actually have seen the system as a very useful tool versus the system we previously had to actually address those issues. And we continue to identify ways the system can help. And I would say we have a fully functioning system, but we'll continue to invest in that system to optimize the usage and to address issues as they come forward. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Could you talk about the progress you've made in getting the company more focused on pricing and why pricing hasn't gone up at least a little with volume and inflation with the understanding that a lot of pricing was locked into backlog at the beginning of the year? You obviously are seeing significantly more volume than you previously expected. You did raise your inflation forecast a little bit. So why can't you get a little bit more price as revenue and inflation goes up? \nRob Johnson: Yes. Andy, I'll address the first part, just on our pricing. We feel -- from where we've been in the past, as you know, we feel really good about the 360 we've talked about this year. That being said, pricing is now built into our DNA, how we go get it, our process on a global basis, the approvals when we raise price, and we continue to look at that. Pricing was not just a one-and-done for us. We'll continue to evaluate. We have innovative solutions, making sure that we're getting the appropriate price we have for the market.\n So as we go through this year into next year, we don't expect this to be something we responded to an inflationary thing and we're done. We'll continue to refine the way we go about driving price. So I would expect as we -- part of our thesis has been create great products that solve real customer problems that are innovative and get paid for that. So we'll continue to work that as we go through it.\n David can speak a little bit to why some of the inflationary stuff as the price as we drive it. We are getting to right now, as we talked about in the Q4, a lot of that old backlog falling away and a new price we'll begin to see in that and give us a nice uplift in Q4. But David? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Rob. And Andy, we were fully anticipating that question from someone. So you're absolutely right. As volume assumptions go up, so should the pricing. We've made the decision -- because a lot of that additional volume is into Q4, we made a decision just to keep the pricing target at 360, maybe -- so as to not overcomplicate things. But it's absolutely fair to look at this as an opportunity for additional pricing based on that volume over and above the 360.\n But we also have not added into this external model potential additional inflation that would also be associated with that higher volume. So on a net-net basis, it's probably an opportunity, but there would be an offset with additional pricing and additional inflation just mathematically from that higher volume. But when we looked at it, we felt like we just wanted to kind of keep the messaging simple quarter-to-quarter. And we've included that as a net opportunity in our bucket of net risks and opportunities that we see for the second half of the year. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Sure. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could take that conversation into 2023, you obviously stated that you expect a 50% improvement in adjusted operating profit. Could you talk about, as we sit here today or maybe forecast forward, how much backlog coverage you have on that improvement? I think you said you expect supply chain and/or electronic component headwinds to last well into '23. So what kind of price versus cost or supply chain assumptions are you baking into in that initial '23 expectation? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I can address that, Andy. So -- and I'll probably answer [indiscernible]. So we're not really prepared to provide a whole lot of color at this point. It's still very early. As Rob mentioned on the call, we still have to deliver on Q3, Q4. But I certainly would include on the list of potential opportunity for next year pricing. And you can look at that just from the increased sequential pricing that we're seeing here in -- on a quarterly basis in 2022. There's going to be probably $150 million to $200 million carryover pricing benefit just by doing the calculus, right?\n So as it relates to some of the other elements, notably backlog coverage, we certainly have a robust backlog today. To a certain extent, we're filling backlog for the second half of next year with some of our products. So we're feeling really good from a demand perspective. But there's certainly -- we would place more uncertainty as it relates to inflation and the supply chain as we have seen -- those are somewhat material as it relates to month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. But we believe we're doing everything we can within our power and being proactive to address it. But it's hard at this point to give any type of quantitative detail on what we expect for next year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: First question is on the implied 4Q outlook. Maybe you can better contextualize how much turns or book-and-ship business you're anticipating in that guide and how that compares to typical fourth quarters. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I would say we have really good visibility certainly into Q3. And if you look at the backlog versus book-and-ship for Q4, it's likely higher than what we would see in other quarters, so -- and including for a fourth quarter. So a fairly significant ramp in Q4, at least from prior guide, was not related to filling out a backlog. It was very directly related to have the capacity and the supply of components to ship that backlog.\n So every quarter, and even in every month, there's a certain amount of book-and-ship business. But I would say we have really good confidence in fourth quarter as it relates to the backlog coverage. And for us and as Rob mentioned, a bigger risk would be the execution of the ramp of the Monterrey facility and also the additional sand supply. So we don't think demand will be an issue, certainly for Q3 or Q4. \nMark Delaney: That's helpful. And my second question was on pricing, in particular, pricing for 2023. Maybe you can remind us how much of your negotiations are done toward the end of the calendar year [indiscernible] up for the following year. And kind of related to that, to the extent input costs stay kind of where they are, do you think you'll be able to hold on to all the pricing you've been able to achieve as you do go into 2023? Or are some of the customers are going to say, \"Oh, we'll input cost of stock going up. So I'm looking for a reduction next year.\" \nRob Johnson: Mark, this is Rob. Yes, the pricing actions have been done and have been implemented for what we need to do. But as I mentioned earlier, we continue to look at additional opportunities for price where we have innovative products and solutions. So I feel confident that we've executed on those. Those have been put in place a while ago from that perspective.\n As it relates to customers asking or looking to take the price down, it's kind of a similar phenomenon. We didn't get a lot of pricing on the backlog that we had. That was part of our problem. We had to burn through that. So expecting kind of the same thing to happen, that the hard purchase orders that we have today that people want or the price that we set forth in those as we go forward. So I don't expect that to deteriorate either as we go into 2023 if inflationary conditions go. We've bought inventory at higher prices. They understand that. So it's something that wouldn't keep me up at night that we're going to see that activity.\n But we will continue. Even in a deflation, inflation goes away environment, as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue with this pricing muscle that we have now to get price where it makes sense and we're providing more value to the market. And that was a valuable lesson learned from us as we went through this whole activity is that people do value the services and the products that Vertiv made. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Lance Vitanza of Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: Congratulations on the strong quarter. I wanted to ask you about E&I. It looked a little bit weaker than expected and the guidance as well. You mentioned during the prepared remarks some timing-related issues. And I think you said that the asset continues to improve, but maybe you could clarify if I'm getting that right. And in any case, if you could elaborate a bit on exactly what the issues are there at E&I. \nRob Johnson: Yes. Sure. Lance, thanks for the question. Appreciate the comments as well. With E&I, what we've seen -- what I think David kind of talked about when he was speaking is we're seeing some of their stuff push out of this year, push into next year with some of the projects that they have. E&I have an experienced kind of a little bit later than Vertiv did the inflationary impacts and then lack of supply on breakers and then were not, just like us, slower to get price. We feel that's corrected. We really are excited.\n David mentioned the backlog for E&I is up over 60%, I believe, since we bought them. So the activity is good. We've got the price now being built in the backlog and in the orders that are coming forward. So I'm really still very excited, probably more excited, about the asset now than when I was when we acquired it. Yes, we had a dip. And unfortunately, we'll go through this year with that. But we see E&I pulling out of this next year with the additional pricing. We have seen some projects shift, which happens in their business because they're heavily on the construction side of it. We have seen some of that shift, and some of that will shift into next year. I don't know, Gary, any other thoughts? \nGary Niederpruem: Yes. I think that's exactly right, Rob. I mean, yes, Lance, we're -- the amount of quote activity pipeline, the joint development between the Vertiv sellers, the E&I sellers, the embracement that the customer base has had has been phenomenal. And the only thing, to Rob's point, is really some of that switchgears, some of the modular skidded power units that they sell shifted out to the right, some of it because of supply, some of it because of customer set readiness. But overall, it's actually coming up on point just like we had planned earlier in the year. \nLance Vitanza: So you're not seeing -- just to be clear, you're not seeing any issues with how the integration has gone? Or anything that would make you feel less excited about what you acquired? \nRob Johnson: No. Absolutely the opposite. I think integration has gone really well. They had -- a couple of stumbles that they had was really pricing and getting components, and they were kind of later on both of those. A lot of people are talking about breaker availability. Breakers drive a lot of the content in our products, and we still see that as something that's not readily available. We have looked at additional breaker sources and have been qualifying them.\n But overall, integration has gone well. And what I could tell you is, Gary mentioned on the back on the actual funnel the activity and the synergy with Vertiv as we thought it would be is really there. So we never baked in any kind of sales synergy upside to our model. But just what we thought would happen as our sellers would pick this up, we would take it out to a wider audience to the enterprise and to a broader base of customers that we reach and touch.\n So happy with the -- very happy with the asset, happy with the management team there and what they've done. And I think this is going to smooth as it possibly could, except for the getting prices quicker than we did and getting supply turned around. But overall, this fits in our portfolio very well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: So just on the backlog, I guess trying to read the tea leaves a little bit here with the big revenue ramp in the fourth quarter. Do you expect book-to-bill in the second half to be above 1 in total? Obviously, it will kind of modulate because of the big fourth quarter. But in total, do you think book-to-bill can be above 1? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. We're still putting together our projections for orders for the fourth quarter. You can look at the second half sales number. I would say we would expect continued orders growth in Q3. Q4 poses a pretty good year-over-year tailwind. But I would say it would be plus or minus close to that one-time book-to-bill. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just more philosophically, maybe a question for Dave. But how are we defining success at this stage? Is it kind of a hard line on this fourth quarter and the 50% increase for 2023? Or is it if we continue to have these costs that pop up, like they have in the third quarter where the guidance is below, kind of things keep getting pushed forward. If you come to the fourth quarter and things \"slip\" into '23, is that an acceptable outcome for you at this stage? Or is there more of kind of like a hard line here now given what we've seen the last few quarters, acknowledging the sequential improvement is steady? \nDavid Cote: Steve, I assume that... \nC. Stephen Tusa: That's a question for Dave Cote. Yes, Dave Cote. Yes, that's right. \nDavid Cote: Yes. Yes, I would say it's not so much the number itself for the fourth quarter as it is the lead into 2023. As you know, this whole year has been one of having to transition through a backlog, be a hell of a lot more aggressive on price than we were and be a lot more aggressive on [indiscernible]. So this was a transition year for us. So the whole point was to get price, to get Americas fixed enough so that it was in a position where it could perform and to lead us into what I think is going to be a very good 2023. And that's going to be -- that's the game that we're playing here is to work our way into a position where for '23 onward, we're in the kind of position to perform that we thought we were before. This has been a tactical year that we've had to run into.\n The strategy of the company is still right, still good. It's a great position in a good industry. Technology is good. We're still doing all the new product intros, still increasing R&D spending. The trick here has been to get Americas fixed and to get price running ahead of total inflation, not just inflation for '22. And that's the way it looks like it's coming together at this point. As I said, I feel good about the profile and feeling good about '23, but that's the game for us. \nC. Stephen Tusa: And anything lumpy seasonally about '23? Like if you do push out of 4Q into 1Q, I would assume that price cost, that kind of stuff, shouldn't be that lumpy so that you should start 2023 on a pretty strong footing? If that's the case, it would kind of reinforce what you see for '23? Or is '23 more back-end -- just as back-end loaded because of seasonality? \nDavid Cote: No. With the kind of lead in that we should get from 4Q, we would expect 1Q to be markedly different from what it was this year. Dave, I assume you agree with that. \nDavid Fallon: I totally agree. And yes, the key there is the additional fan supply we're getting in the fourth quarter will certainly lead into Q1, Q2. So there's always seasonality, but probably a little bit less pronounced next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. \nDavid Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Hyperscale and colocation CapEx, maybe more cyclical -- sorry, more secular than cyclical. But historically, enterprise and SMB CapEx has been tied to the broader economy. Wondering what you're hearing from the field from sales about enterprise pipeline. Have you heard anything about 2023 CapEx plans? \nRob Johnson: David, this is Rob. I'll try with that. And Gary, you can kind of chime in there. What I'd say is the activity in enterprise has been kind of cycled by the COVID and people still not fully going back to the office. So what we are seeing is a phenomenon as people go back to the office, it refreshed their edge, their closets, that type of thing. So that activity has been fairly strong. The projects in that space are fairly strong from what we're seeing from the field on the enterprise side of things.\n Some of our larger enterprise data center customers continue to build and continue to have demand on us. So we -- I'm pretty bullish on what we're seeing just what's necessary to update the enterprises and then expand the enterprises. As we mentioned, data is not slowing down by any stretch, and people are using data to drive more efficiency in there. And in order to do that, they're going to have to have the compute and/or the infrastructure to make that happen. I don't know, Gary, you were going to say something? \nGary Niederpruem: I think that's exactly right, Rob. So David, you're right, the cloud and colo, that CapEx, it's always hard to peg in any given quarter. So we look at more of the trajectory and the run rate of that. That all looks very healthy. In the enterprise, there would not be a light CapEx number that gets published anywhere, so we do. We take a lot of that from voice to customer and from our pipeline and what we're hearing directly from the individuals.\n And to Rob's point, we have not heard any conversations pick up anywhere around, hey, we're going to slow down, hey, we're doing this, hey, we're planning for this in 2023, that looks any different than what we thought over the last couple of quarters. So we still think enterprise, edge, IT channel, all that market is pretty healthy. The only one exception was China had a little bit of a setback in enterprise just because of the COVID lockdown that occurred in late Q1 and Q2, but they're coming out of that now. So we're seeing that pipeline start to ramp up in enterprise. So everything we see in that area in channel, edge, enterprise or lump it all together, still looks pretty good and robust to us. \nAndrew Obin: Got it. That's helpful. And then in the Americas region, that's really the key for you to have a meaningful margin recovery. Can you just give a little bit more color on the internal initiatives that you have beyond sort of the Monterrey facility that would drive margin expansion going forward? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. David, this is David. So certainly, if you look at the second quarter and some of the headwinds versus last year, so to kind of compare it prior to this higher inflation supply chain-challenged environment, price/cost certainly played a role. The Americas was actually still negative price/cost in Q2. I think it was about $10 million. We certainly feel like we'll address that with the additional pricing we expect to get in the second half of the year.\n But pricing will continue to be a lever. And we've never been super aggressive with pricing. And what we've realized is that we've left a lot of money on the table. We could have been pricing much more aggressively for a long while here. And based on the strength of our products [indiscernible] products, we'll continue to be aggressive with pricing. So that will continue to be a lever next year even beyond offsetting inflation, whether from a dollar perspective or a percentage perspective.\n But a lot of the other things, I don't want to discount them by calling them blocking and tackling. But there are a lot of elements of operations that we have identified over the last 6 months or so that can be significantly improved. We talked a lot about the SIOP process. That's not only going to improve our ability to manage inventory, it will improve our ability to drive margin. Capacity planning is another, the organizational structure, continuing to get benefits from ERP and driving process and putting additional tools in place.\n So going back to maybe in the very beginning, this Americas region was built through a series of acquisitions that never were really integrated. We've done some of that over the last 4 or 5 years. And there's still a ton of benefit out there just by putting in place some improved processes. And I think we're already starting to see that benefit. And we would expect an acceleration of those things in 2023 and beyond. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks. \nRob Johnson: Okay. Thank you, and thank you to everybody for participating today and for your support. Our second quarter is another step forward in delivering on our plan that we detailed out last February. It continues to be a dynamic time in a macro environment, but we remain firmly focused on executing a strong second half, which will provide a strong setup for 2023.\n Again, appreciate everyone's support, and I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. \nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results. As you can see, net sales increased 11% from last year's second quarter, and we're up 8% organically, including 2% from volume and 6% from price. The E&I acquisition added $114 million in net sales and was partially offset by a $60 million FX headwind, more than 70% of that headwind in EMEA. And we also had a headwind related to the divestiture of our industrial UPS business in EMEA, and that was a $17 million headwind.\n Pricing added $80 million in the quarter, which was in line with guidance and double what we saw in the first quarter as we continue to burn through the lower-priced backlog and recognize more sales booked after we implemented substantial price increases late last year and earlier this year. Adjusted operating profit of $82 million exceeded the midpoint of guidance, but was $52 million lower than last year's second quarter.\n We list some of the components of this reduction at the bottom of the page. But in summary, there was $11 million -- or $10 million unfavorable price/cost; and $45 million headwind from FX and other, including a $10 million foreign exchange headwind; $10 million from direct labor, inflation and inefficiency, in part driven by the supply chain challenges; and approximately $20 million from cost headwinds in the Americas, primarily related to customer support costs, our sales incentive compensation program and several other drivers.\n We expect to see continued year-over-year cost headwinds in the Americas in the third quarter, but we believe we have identified and addressed most of these issues as we will enter the fourth quarter and transition into 2023. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.10 for the quarter, which was in line with guidance. Second quarter free cash flow was negative $232 million. While we expected a net use of cash, it was certainly higher than we anticipated.\n As Rob mentioned, we have not reduced inventory consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year, in part due to continued supply chain challenges, but also in preparation for the significant volume ramp in the second half of the year. We are improving our SIOP processes globally. And as Dave mentioned, notably in the Americas, and we expect to receive an inventory free cash flow dividend at some point in 2023.\n Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. We saw a sequential quarterly improvement in organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin across all 3 regions. The Americas region grew organically 6.6% or $37 million with most of that growth coming from price. We do anticipate more balance between price and volume in Americas in the second half of 2022, including mid-teen year-over-year volume growth as we continue to qualify new suppliers and launch the Monterrey facility.\n Americas adjusted operating profit of $82 million was negatively impacted year-over-year by price/cost, higher fixed costs, including to support the volume ramp-up in the second half and additional cost headwinds we referenced on the previous slide. In APAC, organic sales increased 5.9% despite the China COVID lockdowns, which we estimate lowered second quarter sales by approximately $30 million. Notwithstanding the impact of the lockdowns, adjusted operating profit for APAC was actually higher than our expectations as we were able to drive higher sales in other APAC subregions while managing fixed costs.\n Finally, we continue to see strong growth in EMEA with organic sales up 13.3% with a good balance between volume and price. While inflation accelerated in the second quarter from the first quarter, so did our pricing. Our second quarter net price/cost in EMEA, while still a headwind, was less of a headwind than what we saw in Q1, and we expect price/cost to be a significant tailwind in the second half of the year.\n Moving to Slide 8, we summarize our updated third quarter guidance, which is about $50 million lower at the midpoint than our previous guidance. This slide summarizes third quarter versus last year, but likely more pertinent is an analysis of the changes from our previous guidance, which we provide in a couple of slides. Despite the reduction, third quarter guidance still reflects a material sequential step-up from the second quarter across all of our key financial metrics with organic sales expected to be up approximately $100 million, 70% of that volume, and adjusted operating profit expected to be up almost $60 million at the midpoint. Despite the reduction from our prior guidance, our third quarter expectations return us to an adjusted operating profit level from last year's third quarter and will serve as a strong bridge to a substantial improvement in the fourth quarter and transition us into a very strong 2023.\n Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our revised full year financial guidance, which reflects the $37.5 million lower adjusted operating profit at the midpoint versus our prior guidance. Once again, we provide detail of this reduction on Slide 10, the next page. But from a macro perspective, it is driven by a $25 million foreign exchange headwind and an additional $12.5 million net from additional cost wins in various categories, partially offset by the benefit from incremental sales volume. And more on this on the next slide. But as Rob mentioned at the outset, as it relates to free cash flow, we are reducing our full year guidance to a range of positive $25 to negative $25 million in part due to lower expected adjusted operating profit, but probably more significantly from changed expectations with our expected inventory reduction.\n We continue to improve our SIOP processes in what is a very challenging supply chain environment. And we're encouraged that these improved processes will result in much improved inventory management, but the timing of the inventory reduction benefits will likely be pushed into 2023. Nonetheless, we are still anticipating significant improvements in free cash flow in the second half of the year and -- notably in the fourth quarter.\n Now turning to Slide 10. We provide additional detail underlying changes from our previous guidance. As you can see on the slide, foreign currency translation, certainly driven by the strengthening U.S. dollar, negatively impacted net sales by approximately $160 million for the full year and adjusted operating profit by approximately $25 million. We include some additional information on our foreign currency exposure on Page 27 in the appendix in this package. But just as a broad overview, over 50% of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the euro and British pound have been more acute than other currencies. And as a result, over 70% of our negative FX impact is in EMEA.\n Moving on. Incremental volume is expected to generate an additional $230 million of sales, $100 million of that was in the second quarter, and these sales translate into $82 million of adjusted operating profit for the full year. And there is a pronounced increase in volume in the fourth quarter as we've increased sales expectations, primarily in the Americas based upon our success in qualifying new suppliers and, of course, the launch of the Monterrey facility.\n Material inflation is up $20 million from our previous guidance, $10 million in each Q2 and Q3, primarily driven by continued higher costs for electronic components and spot buys. We anticipate this pressure to ease somewhat heading into the fourth quarter as we continue to bring additional suppliers into our supply chain. We have reduced profit expectations for E&I for the full year by about $12 million. This is mostly driven by timing as shipments have shifted to the right and into 2023. But that business continues to improve, and the demand environment continues to be strong with backlog at E&I up over 60% from year-end 2021, which portends significant sales and profitability improvement heading into 2023.\n We have increased our fixed cost estimates for the year by approximately $30 million. Most of this driven by timing as we anticipate adding some of these fixed costs in early 2023, but we accelerated the timing to support the higher volume in the second half and for early 2023. Some of these higher fixed costs are also related to IT spending as we continue to optimize our ERP system in the Americas.\n And last on this chart are other cost headwinds, primarily in the Americas, and as we mentioned, associated with any number of underlying factors, most of which we believe are transitory and addressable and should be mitigated as we enter the fourth quarter and pivot into 2023.\n So in summary, on this slide, current full year guidance is about $37 million lower than prior guidance at the midpoint, $25 million of that related to FX with $50 million of $37 million reduction in the third quarter, offset by an $11 million increase in the fourth quarter and, of course, the $2 million beat in the second quarter.\n Next, turning to Slide 11. We provide a sequential bridge from third quarter to fourth quarter for both net sales and adjusted operating profit, a $220 million increase in net sales and a $113 million increase in adjusted operating profit. We understand that based upon our fourth quarter last year, there may be some concerns with our ability to deliver a robust fourth quarter this year. To help allay these potential concerns, we provide this bridge, which quantifies the sources of the uplift.\n First, the higher volume is certainly supported by improved visibility in the sourcing. And as we've mentioned, the launch of the Monterrey facility. In addition, it's very important to understand, we normally have a seasonal volume ramp from third quarter to fourth quarter. The $35 million sequential pricing benefit is driven by the continued burn of lower-priced backlog in previous quarters with a vast majority of our fourth quarter shipments from higher-priced orders from late 2021 and early 2022. We anticipate approximately $10 million additional adjusted operating profit from E&I in the fourth quarter, primarily from incremental volume, which should flow through at higher margins, pursuant to improve pricing, similar dynamic for the base Vertiv business. And finally, as we discussed on the prior slide, other is driven by the ramp down in the Americas cost headwinds partially offset by additional fixed costs.\n So in summary, the fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance of $253 million at the midpoint certainly represents a substantial quarter for us, especially considering the $13 million adjusted operating profit in the first quarter and the $82 million in the second quarter. However, we believe we are addressing 2 of the most pressing issues that drove lower firsthand -- first half performance: pricing and supply chain constraints. And we have visibility and confidence in our ability to deliver these fourth quarter projections.\n On the following slide, so Slides 12 through 14, we will continue to be transparent with our communications around our plan and provide additional details for the second half. In February, we laid out an aggressive but achievable plan through the first 6 months. Our high-level scorecard reflects $91 million higher sales, $25 million higher adjusted operating profit, $10 million higher pricing and $5 million lower inflation. And likely more important, our expectations for the fourth quarter have not significantly changed from the beginning of the year.\n On Page 12, this illustrates our current quarterly sales guidance at the top of the slide and our prior April guidance at the bottom. There's certainly a lot of numbers on this slide. I won't go through each and every one of them. But of note, on the right, is the increased volume growth from our previous guidance, higher across all 3 regions, but most certainly, most significant in the Americas as we have referenced.\n Turning to Page 13. This slide summarizes our updated quarterly adjusted operating profit and margin guidance, a similar construct to the previous slide with current guidance at the top and the April guidance at the bottom. We've already discussed changes in guidance and the step-up from the third quarter to a fourth quarter that would be a record high and by a wide margin for sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin between 14% and 15%.\n Finally for me, for prepared remarks on Slide 14, we show the expected quarterly 2022 progression of our regional adjusted operating margins. We have primarily focused externally on the recovery plan for the Americas. But as reflected on this slide, there is expected sequential quarterly adjusted operating margin improvement across all 3 regions. And even though not depicted on this slide, the same is true for E&I. The scale of the improvement is more significant in the Americas than EMEA as they were more impacted by inflation than APAC. But these charts illustrate that the entire Vertiv global team is driving improved execution. Clearly, we are focused on unlocking value on a global basis, and we know you are watching closely, and we'll continue to be very transparent with the status of our progress.\n With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Yes. Thanks, Nigel. This is David. So there's really 2 categories, and we try to break those out on Slide 10. But the first category is related to fixed costs. And these are certainly tied, although not completely tied, to additional cost to support the second half ramp up in volume. And some of these costs we anticipated to add at the beginning of 2023, but we brought them forward. Most of these are plant-related costs, but also includes some engineering costs related to the qualifying of new vendors and parts.\n But I think there's probably a question if these would create a tail or a headwind for 2023. I think that $15 million we're expecting in Q4, you annualize that to $60 million versus the $30 million for this year would imply a $30 million headwind. Some of these costs certainly are one-time-related to support either a hard ramp in a plant like Monterrey or a soft ramp in many of the other plants that are seeing high volumes. So I would not anticipate to see a significant year-over-year headwind related to fixed costs in 2023.\n The other cost headwinds bucket, which we estimate at about $18 million in Q2, $15 million in Q3, we truly believe these are transitory. These are very specific issues. We mentioned a couple of them in the slide deck: customer support costs, also higher costs related to the sales incentive plan. These are -- and there's a host of other issues that Gio and his team have been identifying and addressing over the last 2 quarters or so. And we believe we have them identified. They'll continue to present a headwind in Q3, but we believe these should be fully resolved in Q4 and from a year-over-year basis actually provide a nice year-over-year tailwind for 2023. No. You're absolutely right. I think we've seen a little bit of stability, although there continues to be variability as it relates to electronic components. Inflation there certainly is higher than we anticipated heading into the quarter. I think the light at the end of the tunnel is related to the new supplier qualifications that we're seeing that should come online in the fourth quarter.\n So I think if you look at the ramp-up of new inflation, I think we saw $15 million in Q1. That ramped to $40 million in Q2, and we anticipate that $40 million of new inflation will remain consistent in Q3. And we actually have implied in our guidance a $5 million dip in Q4. But still subject to change. There's still a lot of uncertainty and challenges with the electronic components, we're still relying to a certain extent on spot buys, but we believe we've taken some really proactive steps and initiatives to address that higher -- those higher costs we're paying and primarily through qualifying new suppliers. Probably not prepared to commit on a free cash flow conversion for next year, but we certainly are optimistic. Our beginning-of-the-year guidance for inventory actually assumed a $50 million reduction from end of year 2021. And that's a 2021 year-end number. That was actually up fairly significantly from the end of 2020.\n Yes, in reality, we'll probably build inventory by about $100 million again in 2022. That's $150 million delta, and there's other moving pieces. But that effectively explains the takedown in the full -- for the full year number from $150 million to about 0 at midpoint. There is definitely opportunity as it relates to optimizing our inventory levels. We are very confident that we are executing towards that opportunity through our SIOP processes. And I would be very optimistic that we should have a reduction -- a real reduction in inventory or certainly from a DIO perspective in 2023. So we refer to that internally as a dividend, and it should not only create a very nice one-time benefit from that reduction in 2023, but certainly on an ongoing basis as we look at our [indiscernible]. Yes. Thanks, Scott. Oh, no. It's a great question. No. And Scott, I can assure you that's not the first time that, that question was asked. It's certainly been a focus here internally. We are still absolutely committed to holding fixed cost constant on a year-over-year basis going forward. The added fixed cost that we're seeing here in 2022, we -- that is more from a timing perspective. These are fixed costs that we had anticipated adding in the first half of 2023.\n Just to put these fixed costs in perspective and the need for the timing, our second quarter sales at an annual run rate were about $5.6 billion. That's ramping up to $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter. And so we continue to focus on fixed costs. I think we have seen increases over the last couple of years, but most of those increases are pursuant to operations and higher capacity and also ER&D.\n I can tell you, our administrative functions are absolutely constant from a fixed cost basis in 2023 versus -- or in 2022 versus 2021 and will continue to be. But we are selective with fixed costs. And to the extent that it creates a future return, including R&D and from an operational perspective, we'll choose from a timing perspective to sometimes accelerate those. Yes. Jeff, this is David. So it's a combination of things. And one example, we had to rent a crane to facilitate the installation of product into a customer site. So we continue to focus on our customers, and in some cases, we'll actually foot the bill as it relates to hitting timing. Some of those customers' store costs are also pursuant to late deliveries. And in some cases, our contracts include penalties if we don't deliver product in the agreed amount of time.\n So a lot of these things are certainly tied into the supply chain. We're still kind of day to day as it relates to supply, which creates a lot of uncertainty with delivery. And some points, we just have to catch up and spend some of our own money to hit some promised customer delivery dates. So the reason this is tied into the new supply is a lot of those pressures should go away as we continue to qualify new investors. And when you can spread that risk over 3 or 4 vendors as opposed to 1 or 2, it really helps planning out a plant and a delivery schedule, and we think a significant amount of these costs should go away. Yes. I would say we are over the significant launch hurdle that you get with a lot of ERPs. That certainly created noise in the fourth quarter, early first quarter. We have a fully functioning system. It's not perfect, not many ERPs are a year after launch. But in conjunction with some of the issues that we have identified in the Americas over the first 6 months, and we're still identifying, we've actually have seen the system as a very useful tool versus the system we previously had to actually address those issues. And we continue to identify ways the system can help. And I would say we have a fully functioning system, but we'll continue to invest in that system to optimize the usage and to address issues as they come forward. Yes. Thanks, Rob. And Andy, we were fully anticipating that question from someone. So you're absolutely right. As volume assumptions go up, so should the pricing. We've made the decision -- because a lot of that additional volume is into Q4, we made a decision just to keep the pricing target at 360, maybe -- so as to not overcomplicate things. But it's absolutely fair to look at this as an opportunity for additional pricing based on that volume over and above the 360.\n But we also have not added into this external model potential additional inflation that would also be associated with that higher volume. So on a net-net basis, it's probably an opportunity, but there would be an offset with additional pricing and additional inflation just mathematically from that higher volume. But when we looked at it, we felt like we just wanted to kind of keep the messaging simple quarter-to-quarter. And we've included that as a net opportunity in our bucket of net risks and opportunities that we see for the second half of the year. Yes. I can address that, Andy. So -- and I'll probably answer [indiscernible]. So we're not really prepared to provide a whole lot of color at this point. It's still very early. As Rob mentioned on the call, we still have to deliver on Q3, Q4. But I certainly would include on the list of potential opportunity for next year pricing. And you can look at that just from the increased sequential pricing that we're seeing here in -- on a quarterly basis in 2022. There's going to be probably $150 million to $200 million carryover pricing benefit just by doing the calculus, right?\n So as it relates to some of the other elements, notably backlog coverage, we certainly have a robust backlog today. To a certain extent, we're filling backlog for the second half of next year with some of our products. So we're feeling really good from a demand perspective. But there's certainly -- we would place more uncertainty as it relates to inflation and the supply chain as we have seen -- those are somewhat material as it relates to month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter. But we believe we're doing everything we can within our power and being proactive to address it. But it's hard at this point to give any type of quantitative detail on what we expect for next year. Yes. I would say we have really good visibility certainly into Q3. And if you look at the backlog versus book-and-ship for Q4, it's likely higher than what we would see in other quarters, so -- and including for a fourth quarter. So a fairly significant ramp in Q4, at least from prior guide, was not related to filling out a backlog. It was very directly related to have the capacity and the supply of components to ship that backlog.\n So every quarter, and even in every month, there's a certain amount of book-and-ship business. But I would say we have really good confidence in fourth quarter as it relates to the backlog coverage. And for us and as Rob mentioned, a bigger risk would be the execution of the ramp of the Monterrey facility and also the additional sand supply. So we don't think demand will be an issue, certainly for Q3 or Q4. Yes. We're still putting together our projections for orders for the fourth quarter. You can look at the second half sales number. I would say we would expect continued orders growth in Q3. Q4 poses a pretty good year-over-year tailwind. But I would say it would be plus or minus close to that one-time book-to-bill. I totally agree. And yes, the key there is the additional fan supply we're getting in the fourth quarter will certainly lead into Q1, Q2. So there's always seasonality, but probably a little bit less pronounced next year. Yes. David, this is David. So certainly, if you look at the second quarter and some of the headwinds versus last year, so to kind of compare it prior to this higher inflation supply chain-challenged environment, price/cost certainly played a role. The Americas was actually still negative price/cost in Q2. I think it was about $10 million. We certainly feel like we'll address that with the additional pricing we expect to get in the second half of the year.\n But pricing will continue to be a lever. And we've never been super aggressive with pricing. And what we've realized is that we've left a lot of money on the table. We could have been pricing much more aggressively for a long while here. And based on the strength of our products [indiscernible] products, we'll continue to be aggressive with pricing. So that will continue to be a lever next year even beyond offsetting inflation, whether from a dollar perspective or a percentage perspective.\n But a lot of the other things, I don't want to discount them by calling them blocking and tackling. But there are a lot of elements of operations that we have identified over the last 6 months or so that can be significantly improved. We talked a lot about the SIOP process. That's not only going to improve our ability to manage inventory, it will improve our ability to drive margin. Capacity planning is another, the organizational structure, continuing to get benefits from ERP and driving process and putting additional tools in place.\n So going back to maybe in the very beginning, this Americas region was built through a series of acquisitions that never were really integrated. We've done some of that over the last 4 or 5 years. And there's still a ton of benefit out there just by putting in place some improved processes. And I think we're already starting to see that benefit. And we would expect an acceleration of those things in 2023 and beyond."

            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Q2 was another step forward in delivering on our commitments for 2022. Starting with some of the key messages on Slide 3. Demand continues at a pace I've not seen in the 30 years of my career in this market. Orders were up 17% in second quarter, 11% from volume and 10% from higher prices with a 4% deduct for foreign exchange. Our customers are focused on securing supply in a tight market, and we see that both in our orders and backlog, which firms up the demand outlook well into 2023.\n Our adjusted operating profit exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to work through a number of key actions for improvement. But where we have fully implemented change, we are seeing the benefits take hold. Key among them is our pricing performance. We have proved to ourselves and now, hopefully, to you, our investors, that we are a business that can get price. Our pricing plan remains at $360 million for the full year.\n Supply chain continues to be challenging, but we've made very good progress in securing qualified second and third sources of supply for key components, and we'll start seeing the benefit from that activity in Q3 and more fully in Q4. Our new thermal facility in Monterrey, Mexico has started production, and we have a new fan supplier coming online that has committed to help us meet the significant demand we are seeing across the thermal management market.\n Our work qualifying new suppliers is not only limited to fans. We have also qualified new breaker manufacturers, semiconductor suppliers and other suppliers. While there's still more work to do, we have been very aggressive in our actions to manage the challenging supply chain environment, most notably in the electronic components.\n In light of the supply change conditions and in conjunction with the expected significant sales increase in the second half of the year, we have not been able to reduce inventory as quickly or as significantly as we anticipated and communicated to you earlier in this year. While we're expected to use cash in the second quarter, it was larger than we anticipated. Although there should be an improvement in the next 6 months, we are reducing our full year expectations for free cash flow to a range of $25 million of use to $25 million of cash generation.\n As Dave mentioned, we made significant progress in our SIOP process globally, but we are especially happy with the progress that we've made in Americas and believe, based on these improved processes, inventory reduction should be a significant source of cash flow in 2023. While there are many moving pieces, we provided updated guidance for our adjusted operating profit, reducing the midpoint by $25 million. We have provided a detailed bridge on the changes on these slides on Slide 12 that David Fallon will cover shortly. There is some rebalancing between third and fourth quarter. But in aggregate, we are still on pace to deliver a very strong second half with a noticeable step-up across key financial metrics.\n Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in the market by region. No change in our view across our end markets versus what we saw in April. They are still quite healthy and very strong. Cloud and colocation remain robust. You've seen this in the cloud growth rates reported by all major cloud providers. AWS reported last week that their cloud business increased 33% in the second quarter and believes that we are still in the early stages of enterprise and public sector cloud adoption. Certainly, the growth in cloud market supports this view. Data growth is not slowing down.\n Our view on the enterprise and small to medium business remained consistent from Q1, and we believe edge applications will continue to provide growth and lift for these markets. The communication market continues to see 5G investment, and we're aligned with all the relevant players in this space.\n In the commercial and industrial market, vital applications continue to drive growth and opportunities for Vertiv. The market outlook remains very healthy. It is likely our year-over-year order growth rate will moderate in the second half as the comparisons to prior year will be difficult. But I want to reiterate the end markets we play in continue to be very, very good shape.\n Moving on to Slide 5. Customer demand remains strong. Our order rate and backlog are a clear demonstration of this strength. We are delivering on our price plan and have implemented price actions needed to deliver the second half pricing plans, including that on our book-and-ship business.\n As I said earlier, supply chain continues to be challenging, especially in electronics. We do not expect this to abate in 2022, and we anticipate that we will see pressure at least through the first half of 2023. We have incurred higher costs for electronic components since we had to go to the spot market to secure some of that supply.\n In addition, material and freight inflation was higher as absolute dollars for the second quarter, but generally in line with the -- adjusted for the higher volume. We have started to see some relief in commodity and freight markets. We typically see a benefit on this on a quarter lag, but expected to provide a nice tailwind for us as we go into 2023. We've made good progress in qualifying additional suppliers on key components and should start seeing additional supply hit our factories in late Q3 and further into Q4. This provides support to our volume assumptions for the ramp in Q3 and Q4.\n We have to add some fixed costs sooner than anticipated to support the volume lift in areas such as our new thermal plant in Monterrey, Mexico. In summary, the market remains strong. Supply chain is still complex, but we are getting to the implementation phase for the new suppliers that should help alleviate sourcing pressures on the most critical components.\n With that, I'll now turn it over to David to walk us through the financials. David? Thanks, David. Turning to Slide 15, where we provide our expectations for market conditions over the next 18 months or so. And we share many of the drivers of optimism for 2023 that portends to be a very strong year. First, you've heard us comment on several times on the strength of the market we serve. All major cloud companies are growing strongly and continue to invest. Colocation utilization rates continue to be high. Edge demand and 5G rollouts will continue, and we are very well positioned to win on both of those fronts.\n While we are certainly mindful of the possibilities of a recession, we don't think that blunts the growth of data, certainly not in the near term or intermediate term. In fact, business could likely utilize more data in ways to enrich their business models and gain productivity across their operations in the face of recessionary conditions.\n In summary, our demand remains strong. We are currently filling our backlog for the second half of the -- for next year, and we expect these favorable conditions to continue. On the right-hand side of this slide, we provide a quick list of reasons to be optimistic about 2023. Our fourth quarter is shaping up consistent with our beginning-of-the-year expectations with pricing actions not only returning profitability to where we were prior to the challenging supply chain and inflationary environment but to a higher level.\n In fact, we believe we are in a -- we are a much stronger company today and we'll be a much stronger company tomorrow because of these events over the last 12 months and the results we are very encouraged with that we see for 2023. Although we are not prepared to provide a lot of detail into 2023 expectations, we still need to execute and deliver Q3 and Q4, and there's plenty of uncertainty with supply chain and inflation.\n To give everyone something to work with for next year, we directionally expect that our adjusted operating profit to be 50% higher in 2023 than in 2022. Of course, there are still a lot of moving pieces, and we will know more and we'll update this expectation after our third and fourth quarters. So please view this as a preliminary guidepost as we look forward to a strong 2023.\n Finally, on Slide 16 and again, the summary of our key messages for today. Sitting here 1 quarter further into 2022, I feel more strongly than ever that the process improvements we've made and implementing throughout the year give us the ability and the consistency to get price, coupled with the corrective actions we've taken in the Americas, are going to result in a very, very successful future for Vertiv. Without a doubt, the proof will be in the back half of 2022. I pledge to you that we are committed to executing well and transparently communicating our progress.\n With that said, I want to thank our employees, our Board members for your continued support in our organization as we continue to make significant strides forward.\n I will now turn the call over to the operator who will open up the lines for questions. Yes. Scott, sure. We've seen a large uptick in our thermal business, especially with some of the innovative solutions that we've delivered. So it's really complementing. We're not shutting down any other capacity. It's really additional capacity for the additional volume that we're seeing. So we're -- this is something we've been planning for a while, and we think Monterrey is a great place to be from a cost perspective. But it is really to help the ramp and the demand that we see and the backlog that we have in our thermal business. Yes. Jeff, this is Rob. Yes, Monterrey, first of all, is up and operating. It delivered even in Q2 some products to our customers. So we are shipping, and we are in the middle of a ramp with that going into Q3 and then a steeper ramp going into Q4. As long as we get the supply, we feel confident with the way that plant is operating. And it is needed to provide the necessary volume increase more so in Q4 for us. But we feel confident with the team. They've spent a lot of time down there. And so far so good with the product coming out of the plant right now. Yes. Andy, I'll address the first part, just on our pricing. We feel -- from where we've been in the past, as you know, we feel really good about the 360 we've talked about this year. That being said, pricing is now built into our DNA, how we go get it, our process on a global basis, the approvals when we raise price, and we continue to look at that. Pricing was not just a one-and-done for us. We'll continue to evaluate. We have innovative solutions, making sure that we're getting the appropriate price we have for the market.\n So as we go through this year into next year, we don't expect this to be something we responded to an inflationary thing and we're done. We'll continue to refine the way we go about driving price. So I would expect as we -- part of our thesis has been create great products that solve real customer problems that are innovative and get paid for that. So we'll continue to work that as we go through it.\n David can speak a little bit to why some of the inflationary stuff as the price as we drive it. We are getting to right now, as we talked about in the Q4, a lot of that old backlog falling away and a new price we'll begin to see in that and give us a nice uplift in Q4. But David? Mark, this is Rob. Yes, the pricing actions have been done and have been implemented for what we need to do. But as I mentioned earlier, we continue to look at additional opportunities for price where we have innovative products and solutions. So I feel confident that we've executed on those. Those have been put in place a while ago from that perspective.\n As it relates to customers asking or looking to take the price down, it's kind of a similar phenomenon. We didn't get a lot of pricing on the backlog that we had. That was part of our problem. We had to burn through that. So expecting kind of the same thing to happen, that the hard purchase orders that we have today that people want or the price that we set forth in those as we go forward. So I don't expect that to deteriorate either as we go into 2023 if inflationary conditions go. We've bought inventory at higher prices. They understand that. So it's something that wouldn't keep me up at night that we're going to see that activity.\n But we will continue. Even in a deflation, inflation goes away environment, as I mentioned earlier, we'll continue with this pricing muscle that we have now to get price where it makes sense and we're providing more value to the market. And that was a valuable lesson learned from us as we went through this whole activity is that people do value the services and the products that Vertiv made. Yes. Sure. Lance, thanks for the question. Appreciate the comments as well. With E&I, what we've seen -- what I think David kind of talked about when he was speaking is we're seeing some of their stuff push out of this year, push into next year with some of the projects that they have. E&I have an experienced kind of a little bit later than Vertiv did the inflationary impacts and then lack of supply on breakers and then were not, just like us, slower to get price. We feel that's corrected. We really are excited.\n David mentioned the backlog for E&I is up over 60%, I believe, since we bought them. So the activity is good. We've got the price now being built in the backlog and in the orders that are coming forward. So I'm really still very excited, probably more excited, about the asset now than when I was when we acquired it. Yes, we had a dip. And unfortunately, we'll go through this year with that. But we see E&I pulling out of this next year with the additional pricing. We have seen some projects shift, which happens in their business because they're heavily on the construction side of it. We have seen some of that shift, and some of that will shift into next year. I don't know, Gary, any other thoughts? No. Absolutely the opposite. I think integration has gone really well. They had -- a couple of stumbles that they had was really pricing and getting components, and they were kind of later on both of those. A lot of people are talking about breaker availability. Breakers drive a lot of the content in our products, and we still see that as something that's not readily available. We have looked at additional breaker sources and have been qualifying them.\n But overall, integration has gone well. And what I could tell you is, Gary mentioned on the back on the actual funnel the activity and the synergy with Vertiv as we thought it would be is really there. So we never baked in any kind of sales synergy upside to our model. But just what we thought would happen as our sellers would pick this up, we would take it out to a wider audience to the enterprise and to a broader base of customers that we reach and touch.\n So happy with the -- very happy with the asset, happy with the management team there and what they've done. And I think this is going to smooth as it possibly could, except for the getting prices quicker than we did and getting supply turned around. But overall, this fits in our portfolio very well. David, this is Rob. I'll try with that. And Gary, you can kind of chime in there. What I'd say is the activity in enterprise has been kind of cycled by the COVID and people still not fully going back to the office. So what we are seeing is a phenomenon as people go back to the office, it refreshed their edge, their closets, that type of thing. So that activity has been fairly strong. The projects in that space are fairly strong from what we're seeing from the field on the enterprise side of things.\n Some of our larger enterprise data center customers continue to build and continue to have demand on us. So we -- I'm pretty bullish on what we're seeing just what's necessary to update the enterprises and then expand the enterprises. As we mentioned, data is not slowing down by any stretch, and people are using data to drive more efficiency in there. And in order to do that, they're going to have to have the compute and/or the infrastructure to make that happen. I don't know, Gary, you were going to say something? Okay. Thank you, and thank you to everybody for participating today and for your support. Our second quarter is another step forward in delivering on our plan that we detailed out last February. It continues to be a dynamic time in a macro environment, but we remain firmly focused on executing a strong second half, which will provide a strong setup for 2023.\n Again, appreciate everyone's support, and I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today."

It has taken time to work our way through the backlog, but as we do, performance escalates. The profile will look exactly the same as we outlined in February, but in substance, the story and performance are in line with that profile.\n End-market demand remains robust. Our order rates reflect this strength. And as market leaders in these spaces, we are furthering the gap by accelerating our new product introductions. We also continue addressing the operational areas, particularly in the Americas, that have caused shortfalls historically. While there are still some improvements to work through, the SIOP process in Americas under the leadership of Giordano Albertazzi is better aligned than ever. There is still work to do, but certainly, it is in a much better place and continuing to improve.\n There are other process improvements also being addressed by the new management team in the Americas. They are getting after challenging areas that have really become apparent during these recent periods of high volatility. The new management team is doing exactly what we need them to do: cleaning these up and resetting the base for a great runway ahead in the fourth quarter and 2023 in a very profitable part of the business, the Americas.\n Third quarter is expected to be a sequential step-up in performance followed by another expected large step up for Q4. I know some of you may question our ability to deliver the second half as presented in our guidance, especially a significant fourth quarter. But the team will walk you through why and how we believe that will happen as price realization improves and supply improves with newly qualified suppliers.\n We remain on pace to achieve a significant step-up in financial performance that supports the earnings profile we presented at in February. End markets remain strong, inflation is starting to moderate. We are navigating supply chain challenges and bringing additional suppliers online, and price is sticking. With the anticipated performance profile, we expect that 2023 can be a very good year for Vertiv and our shareholders.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. Steve, I assume that... Yes. Yes, I would say it's not so much the number itself for the fourth quarter as it is the lead into 2023. As you know, this whole year has been one of having to transition through a backlog, be a hell of a lot more aggressive on price than we were and be a lot more aggressive on [indiscernible]. So this was a transition year for us. So the whole point was to get price, to get Americas fixed enough so that it was in a position where it could perform and to lead us into what I think is going to be a very good 2023. And that's going to be -- that's the game that we're playing here is to work our way into a position where for '23 onward, we're in the kind of position to perform that we thought we were before. This has been a tactical year that we've had to run into.\n The strategy of the company is still right, still good. It's a great position in a good industry. Technology is good. We're still doing all the new product intros, still increasing R&D spending. The trick here has been to get Americas fixed and to get price running ahead of total inflation, not just inflation for '22. And that's the way it looks like it's coming together at this point. As I said, I feel good about the profile and feeling good about '23, but that's the game for us. No. With the kind of lead in that we should get from 4Q, we would expect 1Q to be markedly different from what it was this year. Dave, I assume you agree with that."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nLynne Maxeiner: Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv\u2019s Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Rob Johnson; Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon; and Chief Strategy and Development Officer, Gary Niederpruem. Before we begin, I point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating moments of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language inclusion in today\u2019s earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual report, our proxy statement and other filings with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote.\nDave Cote: Good morning. We do recognize our first quarter guidance was a low bar. However, it\u2019s also important to note that we did better than that. We\u2019ve been addressing key shortfalls, including execution of an aggressive pricing plan, taking a realistic look at inflationary pressures, creating a more action-focused America\u2019s culture, and changing management in areas of the business that did not execute well. As I mentioned on the last call, I\u2019ve been more personally involved in the business as we work our way through some of the near-term challenges. The actions we\u2019ve taken has started to take hold, and we see the benefits playing through. The pricing realized in the first quarter of $40 million exceeded our plan by $10 million. This gives us some confidence we are on track to deliver the pricing plan for the remainder of the year. We\u2019re comfortable with what we see in Q2 so far. Demand backdrop remains very favorable. We anticipate even more pricing playing through the P&L, as we continue to burn off more of that lower-priced backlog. The real test will be in Q3, when we expect to see the significant positive impact from our pricing actions that we\u2019ve already taken. And Q4 will more fully reflect our run rate adjusted operating profit that sets the stage for a strong 2023. While this has been very painful for everyone, I believe the actions that have been taken, especially related to price, position us well to perform in the second half and next year. We\u2019re taking this a quarter at a time, we cleared the Q1 hurdle, and we are on track for Q2, which will be a step up from Q1 performance. We still have to prove to you that we can do this, and we are squarely focused on taking appropriate actions to make sure we do that. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Johnson: Thank you, Dave. It\u2019s all about our execution, and we understand that. Q1, as Dave said, was a first step, and we\u2019re driving incredibly hard to make sure we deliver on our commitments going forward. Starting with some key messages on Slide 3. I\u2019ve said this for a while. Demand remains very strong. In simple terms, data growth drives our business and everywhere you look in business and in everyday lives, everything incorporates data, and Vertiv plays an essential role in making sure those vital applications in society stay up and running. Our orders were up 34% in the quarter, even considering significant price increases that were put in place in late 2021 and early 2022. We are relevant with our customers. The order rates are a good scorecard for the market share and clearly demonstrate we are winning in the marketplace, in addition to reinforcing that more pricing is possible. As Dave noted, we exceeded our first quarter guidance. As anticipated, our adjusted operating profit was under pressure in the first quarter, but we are encouraged by the overdrive on pricing performance and inflation lower in the quarter than expected. That said, with lessons learned from last year, we are taking a prudent approach relative to inflation assumptions for this year. Even though we did better than anticipated in Q1 on pricing and inflation guidance assumptions, we are increasing the overall inflation for the rest of the year of $25 million. We are also taking additional pricing actions, but have not included that benefit in our guidance. Due to our large backlog that needs to shift, we expect to see more of this additional price show up in 2023. While it\u2019s hard to predict inflation and price this early in the year, we are taking a reasonable approach in light of what we are seeing. We have modified our second quarter guidance to reflect some pull ahead of sales in Q1. For Q2, we expect to continue to see some short-term delays from COVID-19 shutdowns in China. These are timing-related shifts that are not unexpected given the dynamic macro backdrop. Supply chain issues are still a challenge. Our pain points continue in these areas of electronic parts, fans and breakers. We are not sitting idle. We are working daily on countermeasures to help us address these challenges and expect that the challenges will continue through 2022. As mentioned earlier, 2022 is all about execution. We are on track with the plan we presented for this year. As mentioned, Q1 came in slightly better. We feel good about our trajectory of the quarters ahead, allowing us to deliver a strong second half and putting Vertiv in a very, very good position for 2023. Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in the market by region. There\u2019s no change in our cloud and hyperscale market. Strength continues in Americas and EMEA. The dynamic in APAC remains the same as we described previously. China cloud and hyperscale companies are working to utilize existing capacity to slow down energy consumption. We expect this to be a short-term phenomena, as data continues to grow in China and globally. The colocation market continues to be very strong in Americas and EMEA. This can also be a read-through to hyperscale strength that often use colocation as capacity for hyperscalers, both internationally and need for capacity in Americas. We do see colocation in parts of Asia slowing, driven by the same dynamic in China, as just described in the cloud market. Our view of the enterprise and small and medium market remain consistent from Q4, with particular strength in Americas. The communications market remains strong as technology upgrades continue, especially in 5G deployments that are driving our activity. In the commercial industrial market, things remain consistent with previous view as well, and we see good opportunities in this space, as a number of vital applications continue to proliferate. Moving to Slide 5. As mentioned, market demand remains very strong by our orders growth of 34%. The secular drivers of our end market remain firmly intact and seem to be intensified. The proliferation of data continues at an extremely rapid pace. This creates the need for additional capacity, and we are happy with our position as a pure-play in this market. I also would say, Vertiv has key differentiators that customers do value. We have always been a technology company, and our increased investment in R&D has provided innovative solutions. We see the product differentiator does matter to our customers, and we are now getting paid for that. Some examples of this is our new DSE thermal products that do not use water and are highly efficient. Another example of innovation has been our launch of our new GXT family of lithium-ion UPS systems. Along with the standard products that we deliver to market, we know that customers have specific needs, with engineering needs for modular to solve their problems. We work hand-in-hand with our customers, not only to provide standard products, but to provide custom products that fit their needs. I\u2019m very encouraged by our pricing realization of 4% in the quarter, which was largely based on backlog booked in 2021, including pass-through pricing of things such as batteries and trains [ph]. We saw positive price in all regions, including China. We realize we still have a big hill decline for the second half, but we have taken an aggressive pricing actions to deliver the plan this year. We are on track to deliver the pricing plan for the year. First quarter as an important indicator of our ability to get price. Supply chain, as I said earlier, continues to be a battle every day and has constrained our ability to ship product. The global commodity markets have been negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine. Relative to our guidance, we were favorable to the inflation plan for the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking a prudent approach to the inflationary environment, and we\u2019re adding $25 million more inflation into the plan for the balance of the year. We have teams at Vertiv working diligently to qualify new suppliers and redesign products to alleviate some of the most critical pain points that we have. In summary, markets remain very healthy, and I feel good about our order rates that continues to be strong, even after implementing aggressive price increases globally. Supply chain is a challenge, but we\u2019re working through many of these different with various strategies to navigate the tough environment. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David to walk through the financials. David?\nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our first quarter financial results, which exceeded our guidance we provided at the end of February, as Rob mentioned. Net sales were up 5.3% from last year\u2019s first quarter and slightly up organically at 0.4%. There was an $88 million benefit from the E&I acquisition, a $15 million headwind from the divestiture of our heavy industrial UPS business, and a $20 million headwind from foreign exchange, primarily in EMEA. We are encouraged by the $40 million pricing benefit in the quarter, as both Dave and Rob mentioned, and that $40 million exceeded our forecast by approximately $10 million. Most of the backlog that shipped this past quarter was booked in 2021, prior to the additional price increases implemented late last year and early this year. So this is a good signal that our initial price increases are sticking, and we should continue to see our pricing translate into bottom line going forward. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter of $13 million was above guidance, primarily driven by $10 million of additional price and $15 million lower material and freight inflation versus what was assumed in the guidance. Versus prior year, the $99 million reduction in adjusted operating profit included the $40 million pricing benefit, as well as a $9 million benefit from E&I, which was more than offset by $85 million of material and freight inflation. We also had headwinds from foreign exchange, labor inflation and commissions, which actually came in below our expectations for the first quarter assumed in the guidance. Along with impacts from lower volume, a $10 million incremental investment in ER&D. We still expect price/cost to be neutral in Q2 and a significant tailwind in the second half of the year, as we will discuss in our guidance slides. Adjusted operating margin was 910 basis points lower than last year, and adjusted EPS declined $0.29, both reductions consist with the adjusted operating profit deterioration. Finally, on this page, first quarter free cash flow was significantly lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. The business is typically a user of cash in the first quarter, but we are negatively impacted by lower operating profit and higher inventory this year, with inventory up about $160 million from year end. Although we normally build inventory in the first quarter, we expected a $60 million to $70 million increase. We were negatively impacted this past quarter by both large project timing. And as we mentioned on our previous earnings call, an imperfect SIOP [ph] process in the Americas, which drove an inventory increase much higher than our internal expectations. We unnecessarily built inventory in the Americas based upon a higher sales plan, which drove the purchase of significantly more raw material than needed to satisfy first quarter shipments. We continue to address interlock issues within the Americas SIOP, and as a result, we believe that inventory in ship will balance out over the remainder of the year, consuming most, if not all, of the first quarter inventory build. The negative cash impact from higher inventory in the first quarter versus our internal expectations was offset by better-than-expected EBITDA and higher cash inflow from deferred revenue, resulting in first quarter free cash flow in line with internal estimates. And last on this page, liquidity at the end of the quarter remained strong at $720 million. Next, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to see outsized impacts from supply chain and net price cost challenges. The supply chain challenges constrained the top line again in the first quarter, with $17 million of organic growth or 3.3%, driven entirely by price realization, and we anticipate price will continue to be a main contributor to organic growth throughout 2022. Americas adjusted operating profit of $58 million was again dragged down by price/cost, but we anticipate that relationship moving to neutral to favorable in the second quarter, and providing a nice tailwind in the back half of the year given our strong pricing response in the Americas. Moving to APAC. Organic sales were down 6.7%, primarily due to lower wind power sales and COVID lockdowns in certain parts of China. Adjusted operating profit of $42 million was down $11 million versus prior year, primarily due to deleverage on the lower volume, as well as unfavorable mix. Price/cost was neutral in APAC in the first quarter, as we continue to see lower levels of inflation reading through the APAC region. Moving to the right, EMEA continues to lead in regional growth, with organic sales up over 5%, with a good portion of that coming from price. The price cost headwind in EMEA accelerated in the first quarter, a trend that commenced in December and has been further negatively impacted by higher cost of certain commodities resulting from the Ukraine war. We have implemented aggressive pricing actions in EMEA as in all regions, and expect price cost to provide a nice tailwind in the second half of 2022. Next, turning to Page 8. This slide provides an updated look at our second quarter 2022 guidance, very much in line with our previous guidance. We believe the second quarter will be the next step-up in financial performance as we execute our plan to deliver a strong second half of 2022. It is our next hurdle to clear, and we feel good about the core assumptions in the second quarter plan, including inflation and pricing assumptions, which are unchanged from previous guidance. We anticipate net sales to be up 6% from last year\u2019s second quarter, with organic sales flat on lower volume offset by pricing. Our expected adjusted operating profit of $70 million to $90 million assumes neutral price cost in the second quarter. Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our full year guidance for 2022. Like Q2, our full year guidance is largely unchanged from what we previously provided, with some timing adjustments resulting from our first quarter beat. We are holding our full year assumptions rather than letting the upside from Q1 flow through. We have a challenging, but manageable hill climb in the second half of 2022 and are committed to making sure we deliver that plan. We reiterate the adjusted operating profit guide of $525 million at the midpoint, and we feel good about this plan and the key assumptions included. Delivering the second half will set us up for \u2013 set us up very nicely for a strong 2023, and we are laser focused on critical levers to make that happen. Next, on Slide 10, we provide an update of the quarterly sales guidance compared to our previous guide. This effectively updates the slides we illustrated in our fourth quarter call. Our February guidance is noted at the bottom of the slide and our updated guidance is at the top of the slide. We have reflected slightly higher sales for the full year, primarily in the second half, driven by higher expected volume and a smaller expected headwind from foreign exchange. We continue to expect a volume ramp as we progress through the year. This is the normal historic pattern, but we also expect some of the work we are doing on redesign and qualifying new suppliers to take hold, and we expect to see some incremental benefit from those actions, which will support the additional second half volume. Still, an overall conservative estimate on volume this year that we will continue to assess, but we are mindful that supply chain challenges are not expected to abate anytime soon. Turning to Page 11. This slide is an update of quarterly adjusted operating profit guidance. Again, the previous guidance from February is noted at the bottom of the slide, and the updated guidance provided today is at the top of the slide. We have provided ranges for adjusted operating profit for each quarter for the remainder of the year, with the midpoint for the full year remaining at $525 million. Price cost will be the biggest driver to sequentially improving quarterly performance, and we have confidence in our ability to realize the pricing plan based upon what we have realized year-to-date and what we see in the order book. Quarterly price cost assumptions are summarized as we turn to the next slide, Slide 12. Our first quarter guidance assumes negative price cost of $70 million, while we actually delivered negative $45 million, with price and inflation both favorable compared with our first quarter assumptions. We have maintained assumptions for neutral price cost in the second quarter, while we have increased expectations for inflation in the second half by $25 million, as there continues to be significant uncertainty with both material and freight inflation, notably in the Americas and EMEA. We are working diligently to avoid situations like last year, where we were chasing a growing inflation number for most of the year. We have also initiated additional pricing actions, given this higher expectation for inflation in the second half, but given the long backlog industry-wide, we are not relying on that materially impacting 2022. For the year, we anticipate price cost being a $90 million tailwind, including $135 million tailwind in the second half. This tailwind will set us up very well as we turn the corner into 2023, further enhanced by the year-over-year wraparound impact of our aggressive price actions. Finally, for me, it\u2019s very clear we are working hard to repair the credibility that was damaged with our Q4 performance. Q1 was the first step in doing that, and we will continue to provide detail on our assumptions and projections to allow for a transparent dialogue on how we are progressing. We know you\u2019re watching closely, and it is on us to make sure we execute well and deliver that 2022 plan. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob.\nRob Johnson: Thanks, David. And just to reiterate what you said there at the end, first quarter was the initial step in delivering the 2022 plan. We did what we said we were going to do and are working hard, as David said, to earn back the credibility and really unleash the value of this business. The value drivers of this business are very much intact, and in many respects, being accelerated. We have worked hard to address the key shortcomings from Q4, as Dave mentioned, including taking aggressive price actions, enhancing our Americas culture, making changes in key management positions and implementing core business process improvements. The key actions to make the 2022 plan have been put in place, and we\u2019re encouraged by the progress to date. I have confidence we\u2019re on track to deliver in our full year commitments. As we deliver on these commitments, this will set us up very nicely for a nice 2023. We are determined to accomplish this, and I take this personally to make sure this happens. With that said, I want to thank you, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of pricing-related questions for me. Just first, could you address in, a little more detail, price on orders and if there\u2019s any way to kind of frame that relative to kind of how margin and backlog is developing? I guess kind of the underlying question is, there\u2019s a little bit of uneasiness here that the orders are \"too strong\" because there\u2019s not enough price in the orders. So maybe, we could start with that.\nRob Johnson: Jeff, this is Rob. I\u2019ll address your second part of the question first, and then David will come in over the top. But I would say that if you take out two very large orders that we had, which we did get price on, our orders growth rate was about 12%. That being said, you are correct that we believe, and we\u2019ve mentioned that earlier, that there is still more price to be had. As we do this, and we said we are and continue to do that throughout the year, we\u2019re going to do it more specific to where product lines and areas are growing, where we have the ability to deliver and where we have differentiation. So, we do believe there\u2019s more price, but in the 34%, there was two very, very large orders that had year-over-year price that we were very happy with, which would have taken that orders rate down to 12%. But that being said, we believe there\u2019s more price there, and we\u2019ll go after it. David?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. And just to quantify some of that, heading into this year, in order to hit our 2022 plan for price and AOP, we had five mid-single digits pricing in the backlog heading into 2022. But we also realized we needed to get low double-digits as it relates to pricing on book and ship orders. So those are the orders that we\u2019ll progressively ship in Q2, Q3. And I think 85% of our shipments in Q4 will be based on book and ship, so orders that we book post 12/31 2021. And we are very much on track to realize that low double-digit pricing, low teen pricing in orders that we booked so far this year.\nJeff Sprague: Great. And then, on the kind of the shorter-term pricing. Is there more scope there on kind of shorter cycle parts of the business in the channel? And I think you typically pass through battery, which was part of the equation, but have you done something incremental on freight or other surcharges that are kind of truing up the numbers and give me a little bit of additional cushion here relative to what you originally thought?\nRob Johnson: Yes. A couple of areas to \u2013 you mentioned channel, and channel continues to be one that we watch and we\u2019ll continue to look at various product lines there as well, and it could get \u2013 continue to get price as it relates to the channel, that\u2019s typically a faster moving in quarter, but \u2013 or at least a quarter to ahead. Other areas of surcharges, you mentioned, on freight. We\u2019re better at driving that and passing that along. And then I would say, the other area that we talk about that more shorter cycle is service and service renewal contracts. So those are some other levers that we have and continue to utilize as we drive for price.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nDave Cote: Mr. Spragg. I hope you noticed that we \u2013 third time through, we got your name right.\nJeff Sprague: Yes, your question at Mr. Cote. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning everyone.\nRob Johnson: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Can you give us a little more color into your commentary regarding Q2? As you said, your sales and operating profit guided slightly lower than your original guide, so how much in the way of sales was pull forward? And can you talk about the delays in shipments you\u2019re seeing given China lockdowns? What\u2019s the risk to get where versus getting \u2013 get better? And how have you factored that into your guide?\nRob Johnson: Yes. Thanks, Andy. So overall, we took sales down in Q2 by about $5 million. About $15 million of that was volume, some was pulled into Q1, but some was also pushed into Q3. Now, we did take overall volume up for the full year, and a lot of that is sitting in Q3. So the increase in Q3 is more than just the push from Q2. But in Q2, we also had benefit from lower foreign exchange than we anticipated. And we also took E&I sales up about $5 million. If you look at the overall adjusted operating profit takedown, that\u2019s about $10 million at the midpoint. So, we had previously guided at $90 million in our range, currently, is $70 million to $90 million, with $80 million at the midpoint. About half of that is related to that $15 million lower volume and the other half just relating to timing of some fixed costs.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks for that. And then maybe, just shifting gears, a little more color into inflation expectations. You obviously increased your provision for the year by $10 million. I think you had that run rate of $160 million, you moved up to $110 million from $100 million. You mentioned the changes as a result of uncertainty in commodities, freight, but you\u2019re also being more prudent. Have you seen more issues crop up yet? Or is this just more of a preemptive call given the volatility of the global supply chain?\nRob Johnson: Yes. I think that the key word in your question is uncertainty, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re hearing that on every call. We did beat the inflation number implied in our guidance for Q1, but we certainly are not celebrating. We overlaid $100 million at the beginning of the year in our guidance versus what the carryover impact was. So that\u2019s the math you\u2019re talking about. So we had $160 million of carryover and \u2013 $100 million of additional inflation. We used $10 million of that in the first quarter. It resulted in a beat, but we also understand the dynamics of inflation and especially where we are today, it generally accelerates. And what we have done for that overlay, we have increased the full year from $100 million to $110 million, and we also retimed the impact of that $110 million. So in our previous guide, we had assumed a flat $25 million per quarter. And we told everyone we would update that after the first quarter, after we understand the updated dynamics. But in our updated guide, that $110 million is now time, $10 million in the first quarter, $25 million in the second quarter, $35 million in the third quarter and $40 million in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s definitely reflective of our anticipation of the possibility of inflation to continue to ramp up. And we generally talk about inflation in two buckets, material and freight, and to anticipate a question on the first quarter beat, most of that was in material. And the freight inflation we saw in the first quarter, notably in the Americas and also, to a certain extent, in EMEA, was higher than we expected. So, we certainly think there is risk and uncertainty across both material and freight, but certainly, the freight aspect of what we saw in the first quarter was higher than we anticipated.\nAndy Kaplowitz: It\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Good morning guys.\nRob Johnson: Good morning Scott.\nScott Davis: I wanted to just to dig in a little bit, take a step backwards and talk about mechanically how you get price. There\u2019s a couple of different ways to do it. You can kind of brown people where you can change compensation schemes. You can command and control. But how are you guys kind of doing the push pull on getting the sales force aligned and getting of your compensation schemes and everything aligned so this isn\u2019t \u2013 this doesn\u2019t come back and haunt you in a few years?\nRob Johnson: Yes, Scott, this is Rob. I\u2019ll start first of all, a couple of things we do to get price. Certainly, there\u2019s an approval process. I think we talked about this before that under certain multipliers in which people try to sell the product, they can go and adjust price for the customer. We\u2019ve tightened up those approval processes and taken those to a much higher level. For example, David and I are seeing much lower dollar on amounts that we are approving. So we taken the management team across the globe and really, have driven that pricing acceptance to be there. So we can control of that. And that\u2019s how we know we\u2019re going to get price from that perspective. And depending on where we are in the world and how the sales team and or the teams are getting compensated, I\u2019ll give you an example. A large portion of our U.S. compensation through our partners and so forth is they get paid more if we get paid more. So it really is in their best interest to go negotiate more. But each part of the market is a little bit different. When we go to pricing, our service contracts, our spare parts, we look at each one of those and understand what we need to get, what we believe inflation could be and then price above that. And quite honestly, I think the market and our customers have understood, it\u2019s not necessarily a price thing now, its availability thing and it\u2019s the ability to get it. So that environment has helped us as well drive through it. But I\u2019m confident where we are today, with our pricing process, with our review process, which incorporates the entire management team on a weekly basis. We look at new orders coming in, we see it come. While we haven\u2019t we can\u2019t jump up and celebrate and say, we\u2019ve beaten it, and we\u2019ve got it all done, we feel very confident that we\u2019re going in the right direction.\nScott Davis: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just as a follow-up...\nDave Cote: Scott?\nScott Davis: Yes, please.\nDave Cote: If I could just interject. I would say, at least, in my history, the prospect of getting price increases on a decentralized basis through comp schemes or telling the sales forces is something they need to get really, have a low success rate. And one of the reasons that Rob and his team are being successful here is they have largely centralized control. Whether it\u2019s dictating what the price increase is, the multipliers, approving deviations and just not letting any of that come through. As sales forces in general are your worst enemy when it comes to trying to get a price increase. And it\u2019s that more centralized drive with dictates as to what it will be and making sure it\u2019s showing up in orders pricing is making all the difference for us.\nScott Davis: That\u2019s really helpful. My second question isn\u2019t not good. So I\u2019m going to pass it on to the next guy. I\u2019ll talk to you guys later. Thank you.\nRob Johnson: Thanks, Scott.\nDave Cote: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys, good morning.\nRob Johnson: Good morning, Steve.\nDave Cote: Good morning, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Sorry, not sure my question is going to be much better, but \u2013 the carryover now on kind of price costs into next year, does that incremental inflation this year tempered all your view of what happens next year with the run rate off of the 4Q margin that I think you guys have talked about?\nRob Johnson: Yes. I would say, the way we handicap that internally. So we talked about a $200 million carryover impact for pricing into next year. Based on some of the additional pricing actions we\u2019ve taken just in the last two to three weeks, I would certainly take the over on that $200 million. As it relates to inflation, I think that\u2019s still uncertain, but there likely would be some carryover impact there. But net-net versus what we were expecting internally, just 60 days ago for 2023 is unchanged, right? The bottom line for Q3, Q4 remains relatively consistent, and that\u2019s going to set us up for a very strong 2023 regardless. And the bottom line is if inflation continues to go up, we\u2019ll continue to price for it. And we\u2019re very confident we can do that based on what we\u2019ve seen over the last 90 days or so.\nSteve Tusa: What\u2019s the variability to the margins, if you guys miss on volumes in the second half? You have a bit of a step-up there on volumes. If that doesn\u2019t come in, like, what\u2019s more important? The price kind of cost scenario or the volumes for every kind of percent of volumes, what should we kind of assume the drop-through would be on the miss?\nRob Johnson: Yes. So our \u2013 we talked a lot about variable contribution margins historically. And historically, those have been in the 40% range. Based on the price cost dynamic we\u2019ve seen over the last year or so, and it\u2019s going to continue at least through Q2 \u2013 being neutral in Q2. It\u2019s probably in the lower 30s, and for every dollar of lost volume, we would lose in that $0.30, $0.35 range of AOP.\nSteve Tusa: Right. Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nRob Johnson: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good morning. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the first one is, I\u2019m hoping you can just talk a little bit about the free cash flow number for the quarter. I think it was negative $150 million. It was below what I had modeled, at least. I would love to understand how did that stack up versus your expectation? And then do you sort of expect free cash flow to be positive for the remainder of the next three quarters to hit your 2022 targets?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. So the $150 million was almost spot-on with our internal expectations. Now, there are some puts and takes, and we talked about one in the prepared remarks with inventory. So inventory came in higher than what we anticipated, and we\u2019re working on the issues there. But we did get favorability as it relates to the profit performance or the cash impact from EBITDA. And also, we had favorability related to upfront cash in the door from customers, which shows up in the balance sheet as deferred revenue. So that $150 million number was consistent with internal expectations. Now, for the full year, we still are comfortable with the $150 million positive guide. If you look at that from a quarterly basis, we do anticipate a another cash burn in Q2. It should not be as high as what we saw in Q1, but we do anticipate significantly positive free cash flow for both Q3 and Q4.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. If I could just follow up. Your perspective on sort of the implications from China locked out or part of China getting locked down. I know your APAC revenues were down 6%, 7%. So maybe, you just touch on what\u2019s the implication of that from a demand perspective? And then perhaps, importantly, are you seeing any supply chain implications from parts of China being shut down as well?\nRob Johnson: Yes. Rob Johnson here. I\u2019ll start off. On the China situation, we\u2019ve \u2013 anticipation, Shanghai has been shut down. Shenzhen, where we\u2019re headquartered is now opened back up again. Shanghai is where a lot of the ports are for exporting. We\u2019re watching that carefully, but we believe that we can\u2019t predict what\u2019s going to happen with the COVID lockdown. We believe that they\u2019ve gone through a pretty rigorous process. And towards the second half of Q2, things will open up and we\u2019ll see additional shipments. So APAC, really two things that impacted. One was COVID and one was some of our wind power business, which can be come in cycles from that perspective. But we \u2013 like I said, can\u2019t necessarily declare victory on COVID, we\u2019ll see what happens there. But in general, our expectations that we\u2019ll pick up, anything that\u2019s happened in March and April. I\u2019ll pick that up in later May and June.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.\nRob Johnson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning guys.\nRob Johnson: Good morning, Nicole.\nDavid Fallon: Hi Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: And so just maybe to talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in Asia on that slide where you guys went through like the green and yellow bubbles. I know colo, it makes sense why you\u2019re moving it to yellow. But I guess, when you guys see these digestion periods, in Asia, how long does that typically last? So over what timeframe can we maybe return to green?\nRob Johnson: Sure. So there are a couple of dynamics I\u2019ll start with, and then Gary can give you probably some more color. As we look at Asia, we break China out, we just talked about kind of COVID and the absorption of the current data centers. I mean, China has put a big plant down on building new data centers until the current data centers get utilized. I think that\u2019s a quarter or two phenomenon, maybe, a little bit longer, it could go through the end of the year. As it relates to \u2013 which is part of our AsiaPac story to India, we see actually strong growth there in colo and hyperscale. So just kind of separate that out, that\u2019s an area of what we\u2019ll see, call it, extreme growth going forward, and we\u2019re in a good position there. Singapore has done is kind of similar to China where they\u2019ve kind of kind of locked down on the number of data centers build, get the utilization up, get the PUEs up. So there\u2019s some dynamics there. And again, that\u2019s short-lived, a couple two or three quarters, but that\u2019s kind of our perspective. I don\u2019t know, Gary, any other thoughts?\nGary Niederpruem: Yes, I think that\u2019s exactly right, Rob. Hey, Nicole. The only other comment I\u2019d add to what Rob said is what we\u2019re finding and what the team is pivoting towards really rapidly, as even in those areas where maybe, they\u2019re not doing as much green bill, there\u2019s an awful lot of upgrade retrofit brownfield work that is being done there, which is really good for aftermarket for service for all of these other ideas that we can take to market now. So maybe, that the large power, large thermal business suffers in China a little bit, but we should see a really active service retrofit, things that we can do to an existing facility to help them up their PUE. That\u2019s where a lot of that offset is going to occur.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then, just maybe, a shorter-term question. When you guys put together the 2Q outlook, just anything you\u2019d highlight with respect to growth or margins by region that we should be considering like with the bifurcation of the regional performance. Thanks.\nRob Johnson: Yes. So overall organic sales are flat to prior year. If you look at that from a regional perspective, the overall organic growth is probably going to be outpaced in APAC and positive and EMEA, Americas flat to down, right? And \u2013 but price will be positive in each of the three regions. What is driving that overall sales difference is related to the volume, with volume up in APAC and volume likely down in the other two. From a price cost perspective, in Q1, APAC was neutral and the Americas was about $35 million negative and EMEA was about $10 million negative. If you fast forward to Q2, overall, we\u2019re anticipating to the neutral price cost versus the second quarter of last year. And likely positive in both Americas and APAC and slightly negative in EMEA. So not \u2013 from a price cost perspective, not really significant differences across the three regions.\nNicole DeBlase: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Good morning.\nRob Johnson: Good morning Andrew.\nDavid Fallon: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just the first question, and look, I absolutely am aware of your Chairman\u2019s reputation for delivering the numbers, Dave. But just to understand your guidance, so you did very well in Q1, but if I look at Slide 11, Q2 operating numbers, operating profit, the midpoint was cut by 10%, Q3 by 5%, Q4 by 5%. You sort of talked about the commitment to the numbers. And I just want to understand, is it just pure conservatism? Or how much margin of safety is there in this guidance versus, what you guys have given us to February? Because the tone I\u2019m picking up is that it does sound like it\u2019s pure conservatism. Yes, things have gotten better, but you had enough cushion in the original guidance that you just don\u2019t want to raise for the year. Sorry to be so blunt, but I\u2019m just trying to understand what the messaging here.\nDavid Fallon: I don\u2019t \u2013 semantically, I\u2019m not sure what the right words are, but we\u2019re certainly being cautious. We have reasons to be optimistic based on our Q1 performance with both pricing and what we saw with inflation. But as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re not celebrating the inflation performance, because we saw what happened last year when we consistently underestimated what we saw with the inflation. And that is our caution. And in any regard, it\u2019s hard to take the first quarter and make broad assumptions with what the full year is going to do. And that\u2019s in a so-called normal year. So we certainly don\u2019t want to get out over our skis based on what we did in Q1, and we still remain very optimistic about hitting the full year plan. But we have introduced caution, and I think you see that with our assumptions for inflation. We beat by 15, but we took the back half up by 25. And some are looking at that as a \u2013 and I\u2019ve heard the words cushion used, and we do not see that as a cushion. We see it as a provision for the possibility of higher expected inflation. At the end of the day, we don\u2019t know, but we think it\u2019s the prudent thing to do from a macro perspective.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Look, I just want to make clear. I appreciate the track record of the operating team and your Chairman, so I don\u2019t want to dismiss that. Question number two, are you seeing any incremental decommits from suppliers? And just \u2013 I\u2019m thinking about motors coming out of Germany, given what\u2019s happening in the Ukraine, China COVID lockdowns, just to understand that? Or have things smooth out there? Thanks so much.\nRob Johnson: Yes, Andrew, this is Rob. No, we\u2019re not seeing any incremental decommits. And the way we kind of set the year was based on what suppliers could deliver in Q4. So that\u2019s why, again, looking at not necessarily what they\u2019re telling us they could deliver, but what they\u2019ve actually delivered. And that\u2019s how we really set our plan. So we\u2019re \u2013 there\u2019s various things here and there, but for the most part, some of the big things we\u2019re talking about we think we\u2019ve got it at a steady state. And at some point in time, things will get better. Chips are going to take time, that\u2019s going to be into 2023, late 2023, maybe 2024. Other things we\u2019re working through alternative solutions on fans and other things like that. So as we get more diverse supply base, we\u2019ll have a better ability to even shore up any potential decommits because of some world disaster or something. We\u2019ve got hit and punch with a lot of different things last year and continue to see some of those. But for the most part, we feel good about where the supply base is as of today. And we\u2019ve taken a realistic approach and what they\u2019re capable of doing.\nAndrew Obin: Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Good luck.\nRob Johnson: Thank you, Andrew.\nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes, thanks very much for taking the question. The first is on pricing of the $360 million of pricing assumed in the 2022 revenue guidance, I think as of the last earnings call, $125 million of that had been already booked and was in backlog, and there was $235 million that you still needed to book a higher pricing and on a schedule for 2022 delivery of that $235 million, can you give us an update on how much of that has been achieved? And is there any store remaining that\u2019s needed to be booked at these higher prices?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Mark. We can give an update on that. So your numbers were spot on. So heading into the year, we had $125 million in backlog, $235 million was go get in book and ship. If we snap the chalk line at the end of Q1, of course, we had $40 million in actuals. And we also were able to actually include additional pricing in backlog from orders. So at the end of Q1, we had about $155 million of pricing in backlog that we would realize over Q2 through Q4. And then we had $165 million that is the go-get and book and ship. So if you take the $360 million, that hasn\u2019t changed. We have $40 million in actual, $155 million in backlog at the end of Q1, and the book and ship number is $165 million for the full $360 million.\nMark Delaney: Got it. Thanks, David. And my follow-up question was on the inflationary environment and what you\u2019re seeing for cost. If I understood correctly, as of the last earnings call, the $260 million of cost inflation that was assumed for the year, it was $160 million based on what you were seeing at spot, and then there was $100 million that was just buffer for potential future cost increases. Now, at $270 million, I wanted to check on the composition of that and clarify one, is the $270 million reflecting spot? Because we\u2019ve seen some big moves up in things like steel and freight, so I did want to make sure that is reflected in this $270 million number. And then the second part of it, is there any conservatism now for cost increases, maybe you haven\u2019t seen? Or is there \u2013 there no more buffer and is just based on the spot moves? Thanks.\nDavid Fallon: Yes. I think it\u2019s a combination of what we\u2019re seeing today and the expectation that inflation should continue to accelerate. So the $100 million provision we had for new inflation in 2022. We increased that debt to $110 million, but as we mentioned, of note is the timing. So we had about $10 million of favorability in Q1 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, $15 million of favorability in Q1, but we took the back half of the year up by $25 million. Now, we do have some internal breakdowns of where we expect to see that from a regional perspective and a breakdown between material and freight, but we certainly are \u2013 understand the fungibility and the uncertainty as it relates to inflation. So we certainly have provision, and we do not use terms like cushion or buffer as it relates to our approach to this inflation. We are assuming that this is going to happen, and that\u2019s very critical and key for us as we continue to price for it. So we\u2019re all hopeful, and I think every company out there is hopeful that inflation does not accelerate from where we are today. But we are not making that assumption. We are going to continue to assume that it gets worse. And if you look at that ramp of that $110 million, as we mentioned, we used $10 million in Q1. We\u2019ve provided for $25 million in Q2, $35 million in Q3 and $40 million in Q4. So we will be happy if things do not end up like that, but we are absolutely assuming that it will.\nMark Delaney: Okay. Just a brief follow-up on that just to make sure I understand this. So even if steel to be sustained at the kind of spot prices it\u2019s been at recently and the cost of shipping things around the world stays at these levels or perhaps, even gets a little bit worse, you guys still feel like your cost estimate for inflation this year is appropriate?\nDavid Fallon: We certainly don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on what we are seeing today with inflation, we are very comfortable with that $110 million. Are there scenarios that could come in higher? Absolutely. We saw that last year when we were trying to handicap probabilities of higher prices. But we are certainly expecting continued acceleration, but we believe what we have provided for in the $110 million should cover a realistic expectation of inflation for the rest of the year.\nRob Johnson: And Mark, we\u2019ll continue, as we mentioned. Pricing isn\u2019t a one-and-done thing. It\u2019s a daily weekly activity for all of us. So as we see anything, we\u2019ll continue to drive the pricing up accordingly as we go forward.\nMark Delaney: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to circle back to orders. You called out two large orders. And I don\u2019t recall \u2013 maybe, I\u2019m wrong here, but I don\u2019t really recall large orders swinging the number that much. So my question is, are we seeing here some evidence of increased product scope with E&I coming through on some of the orders here? And then maybe, just talk about E&I, how that\u2019s been tracking? I mean, I understand it\u2019s sort of in line with your FY 2020 plan so far, but margins, I think, are still tracking well below where the M&A plan was. I\u2019m just wondering what the recovery plan looks like for E&I margins?\nRob Johnson: Nigel, I\u2019ll take the first part of that. This is Rob. And then Gary, the second. As it relates to a couple of large orders, I think we\u2019ve mentioned before, we \u2013 and I talked a little bit about the innovation. Some of our new innovations have really taken traction and people who hadn\u2019t bought those solutions in the past or buying those. And then in some cases, securing more than a quarter\u2019s worth of actual supply. We\u2019re seeing 12 months supply being orders pace for that. So yes. So we kind of wanted to take those two orders out that were around some of the new products we\u2019ve had to say, okay, our actual growth rate is around 12%. But that being said, we still very feel confident that there\u2019s more price to go get. And normally, we don\u2019t talk about, who the orders come in from and what, but we are beginning to see larger orders in the past. And then from the adoption of some of our new technologies that people haven\u2019t used in the past and shift anyway from some of the traditional methodologies of, let\u2019s say, thermal management. As regards to E&I, Gary?\nGary Niederpruem: Yes, absolutely, Rob. Hey, Nigel. Yes, we are pretty happy with the traction on the E&I side. So some of that incremental revenue that comes in, some of it flows through the E&I, as a little bit closer to the Vertiv, but it\u2019s a lot of the solutions orientation that we\u2019re getting by able to couple switch gear and busway into the broader solutions. We\u2019re also being pretty effective, at this point, of ramping up the sales forces, particularly in that Tier 2 colo space in the enterprise space to sell additional bus lane switch gear. So all of that is in flight and on that side, probably tracking a little bit even faster than what we thought, being offset a little bit because it\u2019s just tough to combine some of the cost synergies, clearly as fast as we thought with the supply chain and inflation piece of it. But if you take all of that and net it out, we\u2019re pretty much right on plan. And if you look at no different than the core Vertiv Q4, if you look at the E&I Q4, they\u2019ll be in the low 20s percent AOP type of run rate, which bodes really well to give us back on plan to where we should be for 2023. So all things considered, pretty happy with how the integration is going, the culture, the sales force, the customer responsiveness. The pricing, E&I got a late start on and we were very open about that even on the last call, but if you look at what they\u2019ve done over the last couple of months, there\u2019s good momentum there. So overall, really pretty pleased with the way that\u2019s played out.\nNigel Coe: That\u2019s great news. And then, my follow-on question is, maybe, you talk about the efforts around qualifying new suppliers and reengineering products. That was a big initiative, kind of towards the end of 2021. So just wondering if we\u2019ve made much traction there and whether that\u2019s having any discernible impact in terms of supply chain?\nRob Johnson: Sure. Nigel, this is Rob. Absolutely. And we continue to do that today. It\u2019s not an effort that\u2019s completed. Some of these redesigns are spins of new boards and the new code for different chips. Those take longer, right? Those don\u2019t necessarily happen within a quarter. We see good progress on that. Some focused areas for us is some diversification in some of the breakers that we use. And we\u2019ve been well through the qualifications of that, and that should help us as we go through this and continue to work really hard on the fan supply and looking at and qualifying and bringing on more suppliers there and different designs as well. So I feel good about that, and I feel like that \u2013 some of those after we get through released to manufacturing and the volumes can be hit by some of these new suppliers, yes, it could be a positive thing for at least towards the end of the year going into 2023. So I think what we\u2019ve done, a lot of that will benefit from the latter part of this year, really kind of into next year as we move forward.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. Thanks Rob.\nRob Johnson: Thanks, Nigel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lance Vitanza with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nLance Vitanza: Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter. I have a two part question regarding price increases and Vertiv competitiveness versus its peers. It\u2019s probably no surprise, but I\u2019m hearing some anecdotes that some of your customers are none too pleased, and in some cases, have threatened to move business from Vertiv to other suppliers, the first chance they get. Now, I get it. No one likes to pay more and we all like to complain when we\u2019re forced to pay more. So who knows what eventually happens. But my question is, a, do you worry that your price increases may ultimately leave you in a less competitive position versus your peers? And b, what, if anything, does this feedback suggest about your ability to maintain price when the supply chain eventually eases?\nRob Johnson: Hi, Lance this is Rob. Thanks for the question. I appreciate you joining today. What I would say as it relates to the competitiveness and the pricing. What we found something that we\u2019ve learned really through all of this, which has been a good thing is, when we innovate, when we have a superior solution out there in the market, we can get price for that. And so as we think about our pricing, it isn\u2019t just across the board price increases. And what we found is some of our leading innovative products that typically compete against, I would say, more small regional mom-and-pops is that people are willing to pay for that. They want a global supplier. So we feel good about that price sticking for the value we\u2019re delivering. I would say, we probably underpriced on some of these innovative solutions with the value that they bring to our customers. And maybe, some frustration you\u2019re hearing out there because we\u2019re not seeing, we\u2019re seeing in areas and finding areas where actually our prices were lower than they should be or lower than competitors. The market is frustrated in general about delivery and delivery timelines, because the growth that we\u2019re seeing is unprecedented. So I would say, maybe, some of the noise, at least as I hear it is, hey, we want to get those products. We want to \u2013 it\u2019s not an issue of the price, it\u2019s an issue of delivery, and we need those products sooner rather than later. And so our thesis, now, has always been and will continue to be as an innovator and continue to provide more value to our customers. The market will pay for that. For example, some of the PUE stuff that we\u2019re doing in our thermal units in China. We\u2019re one of the few, if not only manufacturers now in China that can meet the government-mandated PUEs coming forward. So we will continue to differentiate on innovation and continue to drive price as it relates to that. There in areas that probably more commoditized, what we rely on there and it works is our service organization. People pay more for Vertiv products if they can get the Vertiv service behind that. So that\u2019s another, I would call, a key differentiator for us that we\u2019re seeing, that through these tough times, people want our service.\nLance Vitanza: Thanks.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rob Johnson for any closing remarks.\nRob Johnson: Thank you, Operator. While the macro environment remains volatile, I feel good about the actions we have taken to deliver on our commitments. I understand we are still in the process of earning back your trust. I believe our Q1 performance is a first step on that path. And I look forward to doing the same over the next several quarters. I want to express my appreciation to all of our employees, partners, customers and investors for their continued support, and I want to say thanks to everyone for being on the call today. This concludes our call.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

That's where a lot of that offset is going to occur. Yes, absolutely, Rob. Hey, Nigel. Yes, we are pretty happy with the traction on the E&I side. So some of that incremental revenue that comes in, some of it flows through the E&I, as a little bit closer to the Vertiv, but it's a lot of the solutions orientation that we're getting by able to couple switch gear and busway into the broader solutions. We're also being pretty effective, at this point, of ramping up the sales forces, particularly in that Tier 2 colo space in the enterprise space to sell additional bus lane switch gear. So all of that is in flight and on that side, probably tracking a little bit even faster than what we thought, being offset a little bit because it's just tough to combine some of the cost synergies, clearly as fast as we thought with the supply chain and inflation piece of it. But if you take all of that and net it out, we're pretty much right on plan. And if you look at no different than the core Vertiv Q4, if you look at the E&I Q4, they'll be in the low 20s percent AOP type of run rate, which bodes really well to give us back on plan to where we should be for 2023. So all things considered, pretty happy with how the integration is going, the culture, the sales force, the customer responsiveness. The pricing, E&I got a late start on and we were very open about that even on the last call, but if you look at what they've done over the last couple of months, there's good momentum there. So overall, really pretty pleased with the way that's played out."

            "name": "Dave Cote",
            "content": "Good morning. We do recognize our first quarter guidance was a low bar. However, it's also important to note that we did better than that. We've been addressing key shortfalls, including execution of an aggressive pricing plan, taking a realistic look at inflationary pressures, creating a more action-focused America's culture, and changing management in areas of the business that did not execute well. As I mentioned on the last call, I've been more personally involved in the business as we work our way through some of the near-term challenges. The actions we've taken has started to take hold, and we see the benefits playing through. The pricing realized in the first quarter of $40 million exceeded our plan by $10 million. This gives us some confidence we are on track to deliver the pricing plan for the remainder of the year. We're comfortable with what we see in Q2 so far. Demand backdrop remains very favorable. We anticipate even more pricing playing through the P&L, as we continue to burn off more of that lower-priced backlog. The real test will be in Q3, when we expect to see the significant positive impact from our pricing actions that we've already taken. And Q4 will more fully reflect our run rate adjusted operating profit that sets the stage for a strong 2023. While this has been very painful for everyone, I believe the actions that have been taken, especially related to price, position us well to perform in the second half and next year. We're taking this a quarter at a time, we cleared the Q1 hurdle, and we are on track for Q2, which will be a step up from Q1 performance. We still have to prove to you that we can do this, and we are squarely focused on taking appropriate actions to make sure we do that. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob. Mr. Spragg. I hope you noticed that we \u2013 third time through, we got your name right. Scott? If I could just interject. I would say, at least, in my history, the prospect of getting price increases on a decentralized basis through comp schemes or telling the sales forces is something they need to get really, have a low success rate. And one of the reasons that Rob and his team are being successful here is they have largely centralized control. Whether it's dictating what the price increase is, the multipliers, approving deviations and just not letting any of that come through. As sales forces in general are your worst enemy when it comes to trying to get a price increase. And it's that more centralized drive with dictates as to what it will be and making sure it's showing up in orders pricing is making all the difference for us. Thanks, Scott. Good morning, Steve."

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Thanks, Rob. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our first quarter financial results, which exceeded our guidance we provided at the end of February, as Rob mentioned. Net sales were up 5.3% from last year's first quarter and slightly up organically at 0.4%. There was an $88 million benefit from the E&I acquisition, a $15 million headwind from the divestiture of our heavy industrial UPS business, and a $20 million headwind from foreign exchange, primarily in EMEA. We are encouraged by the $40 million pricing benefit in the quarter, as both Dave and Rob mentioned, and that $40 million exceeded our forecast by approximately $10 million. Most of the backlog that shipped this past quarter was booked in 2021, prior to the additional price increases implemented late last year and early this year. So this is a good signal that our initial price increases are sticking, and we should continue to see our pricing translate into bottom line going forward. Adjusted operating profit for the quarter of $13 million was above guidance, primarily driven by $10 million of additional price and $15 million lower material and freight inflation versus what was assumed in the guidance. Versus prior year, the $99 million reduction in adjusted operating profit included the $40 million pricing benefit, as well as a $9 million benefit from E&I, which was more than offset by $85 million of material and freight inflation. We also had headwinds from foreign exchange, labor inflation and commissions, which actually came in below our expectations for the first quarter assumed in the guidance. Along with impacts from lower volume, a $10 million incremental investment in ER&D. We still expect price/cost to be neutral in Q2 and a significant tailwind in the second half of the year, as we will discuss in our guidance slides. Adjusted operating margin was 910 basis points lower than last year, and adjusted EPS declined $0.29, both reductions consist with the adjusted operating profit deterioration. Finally, on this page, first quarter free cash flow was significantly lower than last year's first quarter. The business is typically a user of cash in the first quarter, but we are negatively impacted by lower operating profit and higher inventory this year, with inventory up about $160 million from year end. Although we normally build inventory in the first quarter, we expected a $60 million to $70 million increase. We were negatively impacted this past quarter by both large project timing. And as we mentioned on our previous earnings call, an imperfect SIOP [ph] process in the Americas, which drove an inventory increase much higher than our internal expectations. We unnecessarily built inventory in the Americas based upon a higher sales plan, which drove the purchase of significantly more raw material than needed to satisfy first quarter shipments. We continue to address interlock issues within the Americas SIOP, and as a result, we believe that inventory in ship will balance out over the remainder of the year, consuming most, if not all, of the first quarter inventory build. The negative cash impact from higher inventory in the first quarter versus our internal expectations was offset by better-than-expected EBITDA and higher cash inflow from deferred revenue, resulting in first quarter free cash flow in line with internal estimates. And last on this page, liquidity at the end of the quarter remained strong at $720 million. Next, turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to see outsized impacts from supply chain and net price cost challenges. The supply chain challenges constrained the top line again in the first quarter, with $17 million of organic growth or 3.3%, driven entirely by price realization, and we anticipate price will continue to be a main contributor to organic growth throughout 2022. Americas adjusted operating profit of $58 million was again dragged down by price/cost, but we anticipate that relationship moving to neutral to favorable in the second quarter, and providing a nice tailwind in the back half of the year given our strong pricing response in the Americas. Moving to APAC. Organic sales were down 6.7%, primarily due to lower wind power sales and COVID lockdowns in certain parts of China. Adjusted operating profit of $42 million was down $11 million versus prior year, primarily due to deleverage on the lower volume, as well as unfavorable mix. Price/cost was neutral in APAC in the first quarter, as we continue to see lower levels of inflation reading through the APAC region. Moving to the right, EMEA continues to lead in regional growth, with organic sales up over 5%, with a good portion of that coming from price. The price cost headwind in EMEA accelerated in the first quarter, a trend that commenced in December and has been further negatively impacted by higher cost of certain commodities resulting from the Ukraine war. We have implemented aggressive pricing actions in EMEA as in all regions, and expect price cost to provide a nice tailwind in the second half of 2022. Next, turning to Page 8. This slide provides an updated look at our second quarter 2022 guidance, very much in line with our previous guidance. We believe the second quarter will be the next step-up in financial performance as we execute our plan to deliver a strong second half of 2022. It is our next hurdle to clear, and we feel good about the core assumptions in the second quarter plan, including inflation and pricing assumptions, which are unchanged from previous guidance. We anticipate net sales to be up 6% from last year's second quarter, with organic sales flat on lower volume offset by pricing. Our expected adjusted operating profit of $70 million to $90 million assumes neutral price cost in the second quarter. Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our full year guidance for 2022. Like Q2, our full year guidance is largely unchanged from what we previously provided, with some timing adjustments resulting from our first quarter beat. We are holding our full year assumptions rather than letting the upside from Q1 flow through. We have a challenging, but manageable hill climb in the second half of 2022 and are committed to making sure we deliver that plan. We reiterate the adjusted operating profit guide of $525 million at the midpoint, and we feel good about this plan and the key assumptions included. Delivering the second half will set us up for \u2013 set us up very nicely for a strong 2023, and we are laser focused on critical levers to make that happen. Next, on Slide 10, we provide an update of the quarterly sales guidance compared to our previous guide. This effectively updates the slides we illustrated in our fourth quarter call. Our February guidance is noted at the bottom of the slide and our updated guidance is at the top of the slide. We have reflected slightly higher sales for the full year, primarily in the second half, driven by higher expected volume and a smaller expected headwind from foreign exchange. We continue to expect a volume ramp as we progress through the year. This is the normal historic pattern, but we also expect some of the work we are doing on redesign and qualifying new suppliers to take hold, and we expect to see some incremental benefit from those actions, which will support the additional second half volume. Still, an overall conservative estimate on volume this year that we will continue to assess, but we are mindful that supply chain challenges are not expected to abate anytime soon. Turning to Page 11. This slide is an update of quarterly adjusted operating profit guidance. Again, the previous guidance from February is noted at the bottom of the slide, and the updated guidance provided today is at the top of the slide. We have provided ranges for adjusted operating profit for each quarter for the remainder of the year, with the midpoint for the full year remaining at $525 million. Price cost will be the biggest driver to sequentially improving quarterly performance, and we have confidence in our ability to realize the pricing plan based upon what we have realized year-to-date and what we see in the order book. Quarterly price cost assumptions are summarized as we turn to the next slide, Slide 12. Our first quarter guidance assumes negative price cost of $70 million, while we actually delivered negative $45 million, with price and inflation both favorable compared with our first quarter assumptions. We have maintained assumptions for neutral price cost in the second quarter, while we have increased expectations for inflation in the second half by $25 million, as there continues to be significant uncertainty with both material and freight inflation, notably in the Americas and EMEA. We are working diligently to avoid situations like last year, where we were chasing a growing inflation number for most of the year. We have also initiated additional pricing actions, given this higher expectation for inflation in the second half, but given the long backlog industry-wide, we are not relying on that materially impacting 2022. For the year, we anticipate price cost being a $90 million tailwind, including $135 million tailwind in the second half. This tailwind will set us up very well as we turn the corner into 2023, further enhanced by the year-over-year wraparound impact of our aggressive price actions. Finally, for me, it's very clear we are working hard to repair the credibility that was damaged with our Q4 performance. Q1 was the first step in doing that, and we will continue to provide detail on our assumptions and projections to allow for a transparent dialogue on how we are progressing. We know you're watching closely, and it is on us to make sure we execute well and deliver that 2022 plan. With that said, I turn it back over to Rob. Yes. And just to quantify some of that, heading into this year, in order to hit our 2022 plan for price and AOP, we had five mid-single digits pricing in the backlog heading into 2022. But we also realized we needed to get low double-digits as it relates to pricing on book and ship orders. So those are the orders that we'll progressively ship in Q2, Q3. And I think 85% of our shipments in Q4 will be based on book and ship, so orders that we book post 12/31 2021. And we are very much on track to realize that low double-digit pricing, low teen pricing in orders that we booked so far this year. Yes. So the $150 million was almost spot-on with our internal expectations. Now, there are some puts and takes, and we talked about one in the prepared remarks with inventory. So inventory came in higher than what we anticipated, and we're working on the issues there. But we did get favorability as it relates to the profit performance or the cash impact from EBITDA. And also, we had favorability related to upfront cash in the door from customers, which shows up in the balance sheet as deferred revenue. So that $150 million number was consistent with internal expectations. Now, for the full year, we still are comfortable with the $150 million positive guide. If you look at that from a quarterly basis, we do anticipate a another cash burn in Q2. It should not be as high as what we saw in Q1, but we do anticipate significantly positive free cash flow for both Q3 and Q4. Hi Nicole. Good morning Andrew. I don't \u2013 semantically, I'm not sure what the right words are, but we're certainly being cautious. We have reasons to be optimistic based on our Q1 performance with both pricing and what we saw with inflation. But as I mentioned earlier, we're not celebrating the inflation performance, because we saw what happened last year when we consistently underestimated what we saw with the inflation. And that is our caution. And in any regard, it's hard to take the first quarter and make broad assumptions with what the full year is going to do. And that's in a so-called normal year. So we certainly don't want to get out over our skis based on what we did in Q1, and we still remain very optimistic about hitting the full year plan. But we have introduced caution, and I think you see that with our assumptions for inflation. We beat by 15, but we took the back half up by 25. And some are looking at that as a \u2013 and I've heard the words cushion used, and we do not see that as a cushion. We see it as a provision for the possibility of higher expected inflation. At the end of the day, we don't know, but we think it's the prudent thing to do from a macro perspective. Thanks, Andrew. Yes. Thanks, Mark. We can give an update on that. So your numbers were spot on. So heading into the year, we had $125 million in backlog, $235 million was go get in book and ship. If we snap the chalk line at the end of Q1, of course, we had $40 million in actuals. And we also were able to actually include additional pricing in backlog from orders. So at the end of Q1, we had about $155 million of pricing in backlog that we would realize over Q2 through Q4. And then we had $165 million that is the go-get and book and ship. So if you take the $360 million, that hasn't changed. We have $40 million in actual, $155 million in backlog at the end of Q1, and the book and ship number is $165 million for the full $360 million. Yes. I think it's a combination of what we're seeing today and the expectation that inflation should continue to accelerate. So the $100 million provision we had for new inflation in 2022. We increased that debt to $110 million, but as we mentioned, of note is the timing. So we had about $10 million of favorability in Q1 \u2013 I'm sorry, $15 million of favorability in Q1, but we took the back half of the year up by $25 million. Now, we do have some internal breakdowns of where we expect to see that from a regional perspective and a breakdown between material and freight, but we certainly are \u2013 understand the fungibility and the uncertainty as it relates to inflation. So we certainly have provision, and we do not use terms like cushion or buffer as it relates to our approach to this inflation. We are assuming that this is going to happen, and that's very critical and key for us as we continue to price for it. So we're all hopeful, and I think every company out there is hopeful that inflation does not accelerate from where we are today. But we are not making that assumption. We are going to continue to assume that it gets worse. And if you look at that ramp of that $110 million, as we mentioned, we used $10 million in Q1. We've provided for $25 million in Q2, $35 million in Q3 and $40 million in Q4. So we will be happy if things do not end up like that, but we are absolutely assuming that it will. We certainly don't have a crystal ball, but based on what we are seeing today with inflation, we are very comfortable with that $110 million. Are there scenarios that could come in higher? Absolutely. We saw that last year when we were trying to handicap probabilities of higher prices. But we are certainly expecting continued acceleration, but we believe what we have provided for in the $110 million should cover a realistic expectation of inflation for the rest of the year."

            "name": "Rob Johnson",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. It's all about our execution, and we understand that. Q1, as Dave said, was a first step, and we're driving incredibly hard to make sure we deliver on our commitments going forward. Starting with some key messages on Slide 3. I've said this for a while. Demand remains very strong. In simple terms, data growth drives our business and everywhere you look in business and in everyday lives, everything incorporates data, and Vertiv plays an essential role in making sure those vital applications in society stay up and running. Our orders were up 34% in the quarter, even considering significant price increases that were put in place in late 2021 and early 2022. We are relevant with our customers. The order rates are a good scorecard for the market share and clearly demonstrate we are winning in the marketplace, in addition to reinforcing that more pricing is possible. As Dave noted, we exceeded our first quarter guidance. As anticipated, our adjusted operating profit was under pressure in the first quarter, but we are encouraged by the overdrive on pricing performance and inflation lower in the quarter than expected. That said, with lessons learned from last year, we are taking a prudent approach relative to inflation assumptions for this year. Even though we did better than anticipated in Q1 on pricing and inflation guidance assumptions, we are increasing the overall inflation for the rest of the year of $25 million. We are also taking additional pricing actions, but have not included that benefit in our guidance. Due to our large backlog that needs to shift, we expect to see more of this additional price show up in 2023. While it's hard to predict inflation and price this early in the year, we are taking a reasonable approach in light of what we are seeing. We have modified our second quarter guidance to reflect some pull ahead of sales in Q1. For Q2, we expect to continue to see some short-term delays from COVID-19 shutdowns in China. These are timing-related shifts that are not unexpected given the dynamic macro backdrop. Supply chain issues are still a challenge. Our pain points continue in these areas of electronic parts, fans and breakers. We are not sitting idle. We are working daily on countermeasures to help us address these challenges and expect that the challenges will continue through 2022. As mentioned earlier, 2022 is all about execution. We are on track with the plan we presented for this year. As mentioned, Q1 came in slightly better. We feel good about our trajectory of the quarters ahead, allowing us to deliver a strong second half and putting Vertiv in a very, very good position for 2023. Turning to Slide 4. This slide summarizes what we see in the market by region. There's no change in our cloud and hyperscale market. Strength continues in Americas and EMEA. The dynamic in APAC remains the same as we described previously. China cloud and hyperscale companies are working to utilize existing capacity to slow down energy consumption. We expect this to be a short-term phenomena, as data continues to grow in China and globally. The colocation market continues to be very strong in Americas and EMEA. This can also be a read-through to hyperscale strength that often use colocation as capacity for hyperscalers, both internationally and need for capacity in Americas. We do see colocation in parts of Asia slowing, driven by the same dynamic in China, as just described in the cloud market. Our view of the enterprise and small and medium market remain consistent from Q4, with particular strength in Americas. The communications market remains strong as technology upgrades continue, especially in 5G deployments that are driving our activity. In the commercial industrial market, things remain consistent with previous view as well, and we see good opportunities in this space, as a number of vital applications continue to proliferate. Moving to Slide 5. As mentioned, market demand remains very strong by our orders growth of 34%. The secular drivers of our end market remain firmly intact and seem to be intensified. The proliferation of data continues at an extremely rapid pace. This creates the need for additional capacity, and we are happy with our position as a pure-play in this market. I also would say, Vertiv has key differentiators that customers do value. We have always been a technology company, and our increased investment in R&D has provided innovative solutions. We see the product differentiator does matter to our customers, and we are now getting paid for that. Some examples of this is our new DSE thermal products that do not use water and are highly efficient. Another example of innovation has been our launch of our new GXT family of lithium-ion UPS systems. Along with the standard products that we deliver to market, we know that customers have specific needs, with engineering needs for modular to solve their problems. We work hand-in-hand with our customers, not only to provide standard products, but to provide custom products that fit their needs. I'm very encouraged by our pricing realization of 4% in the quarter, which was largely based on backlog booked in 2021, including pass-through pricing of things such as batteries and trains [ph]. We saw positive price in all regions, including China. We realize we still have a big hill decline for the second half, but we have taken an aggressive pricing actions to deliver the plan this year. We are on track to deliver the pricing plan for the year. First quarter as an important indicator of our ability to get price. Supply chain, as I said earlier, continues to be a battle every day and has constrained our ability to ship product. The global commodity markets have been negatively impacted by the war in Ukraine. Relative to our guidance, we were favorable to the inflation plan for the first quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking a prudent approach to the inflationary environment, and we're adding $25 million more inflation into the plan for the balance of the year. We have teams at Vertiv working diligently to qualify new suppliers and redesign products to alleviate some of the most critical pain points that we have. In summary, markets remain very healthy, and I feel good about our order rates that continues to be strong, even after implementing aggressive price increases globally. Supply chain is a challenge, but we're working through many of these different with various strategies to navigate the tough environment. Now, I'll turn the call over to David to walk through the financials. David? Thanks, David. And just to reiterate what you said there at the end, first quarter was the initial step in delivering the 2022 plan. We did what we said we were going to do and are working hard, as David said, to earn back the credibility and really unleash the value of this business. The value drivers of this business are very much intact, and in many respects, being accelerated. We have worked hard to address the key shortcomings from Q4, as Dave mentioned, including taking aggressive price actions, enhancing our Americas culture, making changes in key management positions and implementing core business process improvements. The key actions to make the 2022 plan have been put in place, and we're encouraged by the progress to date. I have confidence we're on track to deliver in our full year commitments. As we deliver on these commitments, this will set us up very nicely for a nice 2023. We are determined to accomplish this, and I take this personally to make sure this happens. With that said, I want to thank you, and I'll turn the call over to the operator, who will open up the line for questions. Jeff, this is Rob. I'll address your second part of the question first, and then David will come in over the top. But I would say that if you take out two very large orders that we had, which we did get price on, our orders growth rate was about 12%. That being said, you are correct that we believe, and we've mentioned that earlier, that there is still more price to be had. As we do this, and we said we are and continue to do that throughout the year, we're going to do it more specific to where product lines and areas are growing, where we have the ability to deliver and where we have differentiation. So, we do believe there's more price, but in the 34%, there was two very, very large orders that had year-over-year price that we were very happy with, which would have taken that orders rate down to 12%. But that being said, we believe there's more price there, and we'll go after it. David? Yes. A couple of areas to \u2013 you mentioned channel, and channel continues to be one that we watch and we'll continue to look at various product lines there as well, and it could get \u2013 continue to get price as it relates to the channel, that's typically a faster moving in quarter, but \u2013 or at least a quarter to ahead. Other areas of surcharges, you mentioned, on freight. We're better at driving that and passing that along. And then I would say, the other area that we talk about that more shorter cycle is service and service renewal contracts. So those are some other levers that we have and continue to utilize as we drive for price. Good morning. Yes. Thanks, Andy. So overall, we took sales down in Q2 by about $5 million. About $15 million of that was volume, some was pulled into Q1, but some was also pushed into Q3. Now, we did take overall volume up for the full year, and a lot of that is sitting in Q3. So the increase in Q3 is more than just the push from Q2. But in Q2, we also had benefit from lower foreign exchange than we anticipated. And we also took E&I sales up about $5 million. If you look at the overall adjusted operating profit takedown, that's about $10 million at the midpoint. So, we had previously guided at $90 million in our range, currently, is $70 million to $90 million, with $80 million at the midpoint. About half of that is related to that $15 million lower volume and the other half just relating to timing of some fixed costs. Yes. I think that the key word in your question is uncertainty, and I'm sure you're hearing that on every call. We did beat the inflation number implied in our guidance for Q1, but we certainly are not celebrating. We overlaid $100 million at the beginning of the year in our guidance versus what the carryover impact was. So that's the math you're talking about. So we had $160 million of carryover and \u2013 $100 million of additional inflation. We used $10 million of that in the first quarter. It resulted in a beat, but we also understand the dynamics of inflation and especially where we are today, it generally accelerates. And what we have done for that overlay, we have increased the full year from $100 million to $110 million, and we also retimed the impact of that $110 million. So in our previous guide, we had assumed a flat $25 million per quarter. And we told everyone we would update that after the first quarter, after we understand the updated dynamics. But in our updated guide, that $110 million is now time, $10 million in the first quarter, $25 million in the second quarter, $35 million in the third quarter and $40 million in the fourth quarter. So that's definitely reflective of our anticipation of the possibility of inflation to continue to ramp up. And we generally talk about inflation in two buckets, material and freight, and to anticipate a question on the first quarter beat, most of that was in material. And the freight inflation we saw in the first quarter, notably in the Americas and also, to a certain extent, in EMEA, was higher than we expected. So, we certainly think there is risk and uncertainty across both material and freight, but certainly, the freight aspect of what we saw in the first quarter was higher than we anticipated. Good morning Scott. Yes, Scott, this is Rob. I'll start first of all, a couple of things we do to get price. Certainly, there's an approval process. I think we talked about this before that under certain multipliers in which people try to sell the product, they can go and adjust price for the customer. We've tightened up those approval processes and taken those to a much higher level. For example, David and I are seeing much lower dollar on amounts that we are approving. So we taken the management team across the globe and really, have driven that pricing acceptance to be there. So we can control of that. And that's how we know we're going to get price from that perspective. And depending on where we are in the world and how the sales team and or the teams are getting compensated, I'll give you an example. A large portion of our U.S. compensation through our partners and so forth is they get paid more if we get paid more. So it really is in their best interest to go negotiate more. But each part of the market is a little bit different. When we go to pricing, our service contracts, our spare parts, we look at each one of those and understand what we need to get, what we believe inflation could be and then price above that. And quite honestly, I think the market and our customers have understood, it's not necessarily a price thing now, its availability thing and it's the ability to get it. So that environment has helped us as well drive through it. But I'm confident where we are today, with our pricing process, with our review process, which incorporates the entire management team on a weekly basis. We look at new orders coming in, we see it come. While we haven't we can't jump up and celebrate and say, we've beaten it, and we've got it all done, we feel very confident that we're going in the right direction. Thanks, Scott. Good morning, Steve. Yes. I would say, the way we handicap that internally. So we talked about a $200 million carryover impact for pricing into next year. Based on some of the additional pricing actions we've taken just in the last two to three weeks, I would certainly take the over on that $200 million. As it relates to inflation, I think that's still uncertain, but there likely would be some carryover impact there. But net-net versus what we were expecting internally, just 60 days ago for 2023 is unchanged, right? The bottom line for Q3, Q4 remains relatively consistent, and that's going to set us up for a very strong 2023 regardless. And the bottom line is if inflation continues to go up, we'll continue to price for it. And we're very confident we can do that based on what we've seen over the last 90 days or so. Yes. So our \u2013 we talked a lot about variable contribution margins historically. And historically, those have been in the 40% range. Based on the price cost dynamic we've seen over the last year or so, and it's going to continue at least through Q2 \u2013 being neutral in Q2. It's probably in the lower 30s, and for every dollar of lost volume, we would lose in that $0.30, $0.35 range of AOP. Yes. Yes. Rob Johnson here. I'll start off. On the China situation, we've \u2013 anticipation, Shanghai has been shut down. Shenzhen, where we're headquartered is now opened back up again. Shanghai is where a lot of the ports are for exporting. We're watching that carefully, but we believe that we can't predict what's going to happen with the COVID lockdown. We believe that they've gone through a pretty rigorous process. And towards the second half of Q2, things will open up and we'll see additional shipments. So APAC, really two things that impacted. One was COVID and one was some of our wind power business, which can be come in cycles from that perspective. But we \u2013 like I said, can't necessarily declare victory on COVID, we'll see what happens there. But in general, our expectations that we'll pick up, anything that's happened in March and April. I'll pick that up in later May and June. Thank you. Good morning, Nicole. Sure. So there are a couple of dynamics I'll start with, and then Gary can give you probably some more color. As we look at Asia, we break China out, we just talked about kind of COVID and the absorption of the current data centers. I mean, China has put a big plant down on building new data centers until the current data centers get utilized. I think that's a quarter or two phenomenon, maybe, a little bit longer, it could go through the end of the year. As it relates to \u2013 which is part of our AsiaPac story to India, we see actually strong growth there in colo and hyperscale. So just kind of separate that out, that's an area of what we'll see, call it, extreme growth going forward, and we're in a good position there. Singapore has done is kind of similar to China where they've kind of kind of locked down on the number of data centers build, get the utilization up, get the PUEs up. So there's some dynamics there. And again, that's short-lived, a couple two or three quarters, but that's kind of our perspective. I don't know, Gary, any other thoughts? Yes. So overall organic sales are flat to prior year. If you look at that from a regional perspective, the overall organic growth is probably going to be outpaced in APAC and positive and EMEA, Americas flat to down, right? And \u2013 but price will be positive in each of the three regions. What is driving that overall sales difference is related to the volume, with volume up in APAC and volume likely down in the other two. From a price cost perspective, in Q1, APAC was neutral and the Americas was about $35 million negative and EMEA was about $10 million negative. If you fast forward to Q2, overall, we're anticipating to the neutral price cost versus the second quarter of last year. And likely positive in both Americas and APAC and slightly negative in EMEA. So not \u2013 from a price cost perspective, not really significant differences across the three regions. Good morning Andrew. Yes, Andrew, this is Rob. No, we're not seeing any incremental decommits. And the way we kind of set the year was based on what suppliers could deliver in Q4. So that's why, again, looking at not necessarily what they're telling us they could deliver, but what they've actually delivered. And that's how we really set our plan. So we're \u2013 there's various things here and there, but for the most part, some of the big things we're talking about we think we've got it at a steady state. And at some point in time, things will get better. Chips are going to take time, that's going to be into 2023, late 2023, maybe 2024. Other things we're working through alternative solutions on fans and other things like that. So as we get more diverse supply base, we'll have a better ability to even shore up any potential decommits because of some world disaster or something. We've got hit and punch with a lot of different things last year and continue to see some of those. But for the most part, we feel good about where the supply base is as of today. And we've taken a realistic approach and what they're capable of doing. Thank you, Andrew. And Mark, we'll continue, as we mentioned. Pricing isn't a one-and-done thing. It's a daily weekly activity for all of us. So as we see anything, we'll continue to drive the pricing up accordingly as we go forward. Nigel, I'll take the first part of that. This is Rob. And then Gary, the second. As it relates to a couple of large orders, I think we've mentioned before, we \u2013 and I talked a little bit about the innovation. Some of our new innovations have really taken traction and people who hadn't bought those solutions in the past or buying those. And then in some cases, securing more than a quarter's worth of actual supply. We're seeing 12 months supply being orders pace for that. So yes. So we kind of wanted to take those two orders out that were around some of the new products we've had to say, okay, our actual growth rate is around 12%. But that being said, we still very feel confident that there's more price to go get. And normally, we don't talk about, who the orders come in from and what, but we are beginning to see larger orders in the past. And then from the adoption of some of our new technologies that people haven't used in the past and shift anyway from some of the traditional methodologies of, let's say, thermal management. As regards to E&I, Gary? Sure. Nigel, this is Rob. Absolutely. And we continue to do that today. It's not an effort that's completed. Some of these redesigns are spins of new boards and the new code for different chips. Those take longer, right? Those don't necessarily happen within a quarter. We see good progress on that. Some focused areas for us is some diversification in some of the breakers that we use. And we've been well through the qualifications of that, and that should help us as we go through this and continue to work really hard on the fan supply and looking at and qualifying and bringing on more suppliers there and different designs as well. So I feel good about that, and I feel like that \u2013 some of those after we get through released to manufacturing and the volumes can be hit by some of these new suppliers, yes, it could be a positive thing for at least towards the end of the year going into 2023. So I think what we've done, a lot of that will benefit from the latter part of this year, really kind of into next year as we move forward. Thanks, Nigel. Hi, Lance this is Rob. Thanks for the question. I appreciate you joining today. What I would say as it relates to the competitiveness and the pricing. What we found something that we've learned really through all of this, which has been a good thing is, when we innovate, when we have a superior solution out there in the market, we can get price for that. And so as we think about our pricing, it isn't just across the board price increases. And what we found is some of our leading innovative products that typically compete against, I would say, more small regional mom-and-pops is that people are willing to pay for that. They want a global supplier. So we feel good about that price sticking for the value we're delivering. I would say, we probably underpriced on some of these innovative solutions with the value that they bring to our customers. And maybe, some frustration you're hearing out there because we're not seeing, we're seeing in areas and finding areas where actually our prices were lower than they should be or lower than competitors. The market is frustrated in general about delivery and delivery timelines, because the growth that we're seeing is unprecedented. So I would say, maybe, some of the noise, at least as I hear it is, hey, we want to get those products. We want to \u2013 it's not an issue of the price, it's an issue of delivery, and we need those products sooner rather than later. And so our thesis, now, has always been and will continue to be as an innovator and continue to provide more value to our customers. The market will pay for that. For example, some of the PUE stuff that we're doing in our thermal units in China. We're one of the few, if not only manufacturers now in China that can meet the government-mandated PUEs coming forward. So we will continue to differentiate on innovation and continue to drive price as it relates to that. There in areas that probably more commoditized, what we rely on there and it works is our service organization. People pay more for Vertiv products if they can get the Vertiv service behind that. So that's another, I would call, a key differentiator for us that we're seeing, that through these tough times, people want our service. Thank you, Operator. While the macro environment remains volatile, I feel good about the actions we have taken to deliver on our commitments. I understand we are still in the process of earning back your trust. I believe our Q1 performance is a first step on that path. And I look forward to doing the same over the next several quarters. I want to express my appreciation to all of our employees, partners, customers and investors for their continued support, and I want to say thanks to everyone for being on the call today. This concludes our call."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Brika, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vertiv's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Brika, and good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Giordano Albertazzi; and Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon. \n Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release. \n You can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investors slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Well, 2023 was a great year for Vertiv and our shareowners. We created tremendous value. Our stock price increased 252% in 2023, putting us well ahead of the #1 performer in all of the S&P 500, and it's up very well again so far this year. We announced the capital allocation strategy at our November investor conference is very flexible and we believe is structured well to provide additional benefits to shareowners and is a great reflection of the cash-generating capability of the company, a very nice and exceptionally promising change from where we were.\n We finished the year strong, quite strong, in fact, and we fully expect this to set us up well to continue to provide good returns for our shareowners in 2024 and beyond. So Gio and team were off to a very good start, but we still have work to do. You'll hear Gio talk about his focus areas for 2024 and what we plan to accomplish this year to deliver another good year for our investors.\n It's getting the important thing customer relationships, technology, BOS, organization resiliency, working capital and capital deployment. We've demonstrated our potential in 2023, but we still have a long way to run, and that's all upside. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thanks, Dave. Thanks a lot. As Dave mentioned, our stock was up 252% last year. And as they said, if we were in the S&P 500, we would have been the top performing stock. We believe we meet the criteria, and we believe Vertiv is a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion. \n Let's go to Slide 3. We finished the year strong. Operational execution continues to improve. Q4 sales were up 12% organically. Growth continues to be led by the Americas. Orders grew 23% year-on-year and 18% sequentially, good across all regions. Additionally, book-to-bill was very strong at 1.3x, a demonstration of market strength that gives us confidence in what we believe will be a strong demand environment for '24 and beyond. \n Adjusted operating profit of $330 million and adjusted operating margin of 17.7%, clearly a step function improvement and a demonstration of our sharpened operational execution. Our adjusted free cash flow was $305 million for a full year at $778 million, resulting in more than $1 billion improvement year-on-year. Our net leverage at the end of the year was 1.9x. So within our target range of 1x to 2x, and we were upgraded by both Moody's and S&P in December. \n In December, we announced the acquisition of CoolTera that further strengthens our technology leadership in high-density and liquid cooling. More to come on that in a few slides. \n I'm pleased with the strong foundation. As we enter 2024, coupled with strong market demand, we feel good about our trajectory for the year and beyond. \n And let's move to Slide 4. We take a look at the market environment here, and it's pretty consistent with what we have been seeing for a while. Cloud hyperscale continues to lead the growth with tangible signs of AI deployment and very strong build plans. We continue to see encouraging signs in enterprise with customers starting to develop AI plans for the business, be it either on-prem or cloud. Either way, it's good for Vertiv. Telecom, not a lot of news here. CapEx is tight and mainly focused on retrofit. \n From a regional standpoint, APAC remains soft, but continues to be a story of China and the rest of Asia. The China market continues to be weak, but we saw some small positive signs in terms of orders. We don't think the market is getting weaker, but recovery is slow paced, if at all. In the rest of Asia, including India, we see significant investments happening across the market. Cloud colocation are certainly leading the pack, but enterprise customers are also investing. \n We moved commercial and industrial to green in APAC, really driven by India. The investment in infrastructure are accelerating. The India market is quite exciting, and we are well positioned. Overall, our pipeline formation is good and particularly strong in the colo hyperscale segment. Let's go to the next slide, Slide 5. I am pleased with the order strength we saw in Q4, 23% year-on-year and 18% sequentially. We entered '24 influenced by a strong 2H '23 booking, driven by large projects, reflecting also demand from AI. \n We continue to post record backlog which was up about $0.5 billion from the end of Q3, good visibility for '24 and beyond. We expect Q1 '24 orders to continue to be strong up in the high teens on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter across the portfolio. We anticipate they will be down sequentially from Q4. This is just a normal business pattern. We are working in close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to make sure we have the capacity in place to support the likely strong demand environment for the foreseeable future. We inaugurated a new thermal management plant in India. \n We have significant capacity expansion underway for switchgear and busbars across the thermal portfolio, including, of course, liquid cooling. As I mentioned at Investor Day, on a weekly basis, we look at evolving demand scenarios in a disciplined, rigorous and focused way to make timely investment decisions. The backlog for AI orders continues to grow robustly. The acceleration of the overall order book related to AI is never an exact science, as I explained, matches the expected growth rate for the application, i.e. a growth uplift of 3% to 4% to the overall market, as we mentioned in November.\n I continue to caution what is and what is not AI is fungible to a certain extent. What matters is that we believe that traction is consistent with the market uplift from AI or perhaps a bit ahead, given our strong position in thermal and thermal is a clear differentiator. Continuing on the right side of Slide 5, we believe that supply chains have largely returned to normal, but I'd say normal in a post-pandemic world.\n We are focused on making sure that resiliency is constantly increasing across the supply chain to weather what a quite complicated world can throw at us. So a lot of focus here. Looking at material inflation, we expect materials pricing to be relatively stable year-on-year, but we are very mindful that things can change rapidly. And with that, over to you, David. \nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results. We finished the year quite strong. Our organic net sales increased 12%, 5% from volume, 7% from price. And America continues to be the growth engine, which Americas was up 22% in the quarter. Our sales performance was within guidance range, but slightly below midpoint which was mainly attributable to a weaker China and some project delays in EMEA.\n Adjusted operating profit was $330 million, up $120 million from last year's fourth quarter and that was mainly driven by favorable price cost and the higher volume. We beat the midpoint of our implied fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance based upon good commercial execution and material inflation below our modeled assumptions.\n Our adjusted operating margin was 17.7% in the quarter, a 500-basis-point improvement compared to last year. And that certainly was driven by our continued relentless focus on operational execution, and that clearly showed in the results. As we move to the right, our fourth quarter GAAP diluted EPS includes a $115 million nonrecurring tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance, and we have removed that from adjusted diluted EPS. And we provide additional detail on that valuation allowance release on Page 28 in the appendix. But otherwise, the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS was driven by higher adjusted operating profit. \n To the far right, another very strong quarter for adjusted free cash flow as we generated $305 million in the quarter, more than doubling last year. Certainly, higher profitability contributed to this result, but working capital is also an important part of the story with plenty of opportunity for continued improvement. As Gio mentioned net leverage declined to 1.9x within our target long-term leverage range of 1 to 2x and down from 5.6x at the end of 2022. This leverage level supports the capital deployment framework provided at our investor conference and gives us significant flexibility and optionality to deploy excess cash.\n Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment results. The Americas region, as I mentioned, continues to fuel the growth engine with organic net sales up 22% in the quarter. The improvement in adjusted operating margin in the Americas continues, up 640 basis points from last year to 26.9%, with the increase primarily driven by favorable price cost and fixed cost leverage.\n APAC sales increased 3% organically, but continues to be weighed down by China, where sales were relatively flat year-over-year, but below expectations included in our quarterly guidance. APAC adjusted operating margin declined 220 points with unfavorable mix and the timing of fixed cost contributory factors. \n EMEA grew 1% organically in the fourth quarter, which was lower than anticipated primarily due to delays on several larger projects. However, we did see an 18% sequential sales increase from the third quarter, which is encouraging and EMEA experienced strong year-over-year fourth quarter orders growth, both which provides confidence for us to project low double-digit organic growth in EMEA for full year 2024. EMEA delivered strong adjusted operating margin of 28.3% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 750 basis points from last year's fourth quarter, although they did benefit from a $6 million nonrecurring gain from an asset sale in the quarter. And as Anand Sanghi, our Americas President, has emphatically reminded us, without that gain, the adjusted operating margin for the Americas and EMEA would have been approximately the same as those 2 regions continue to push each other for highest regional adjusted operating margin.\n Next, turning to Page 8, a summary of full year 2023. I can safely say it was a very strong year. It's always a good thing when the orange bars on this slide are significantly higher than the gray bars and that is the case for all financial metrics for this past year. 2023 produced a step function change in financial performance from 2022 that is not often seen in a 12-month period. This significant improvement is a result of a relentless focus on operational execution, which very clearly reads directly through -- to our financial results. \n Our full year organic sales up 21%, reflects a great position in a strong end market. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, an improvement of 760 basis points from last year, certainly provides a strong foundation to surpass our midterm adjusted operating margin target of 16%, which we expect to do in 2024, with about 110 basis points to spare at the midpoint. \n We did well in converting the improved profitability to cash with an over $1 billion improvement year-over-year. And let me repeat that, an over $1 billion improvement in adjusted free cash flow year-over-year, with this improvement driven by the higher profitability and improved working capital management while continuing to invest in CapEx to support growth.\n Adjusted free cash flow of $778 million drove an adjusted free cash flow conversion of 114%, with this improved conversion benefiting from a significant increase in deferred revenue primarily from advanced customer payments, which increased $280 million or 80% in the year, while sales were up 21%, which we estimate contributed about 30 percentage points to that conversion. While we expect continued growth in deferred revenue, there are many market dynamics at play, and we should not expect similar growth in 2024, which is one of the primary reasons we are guiding to adjusted free cash flow conversion in the low to mid-90s for full year 2024.\n We have much work to do, and there's plenty of opportunity for continued improvement, but 2023 certainly demonstrates our potential and helps build credibility and confidence that we can execute upon our long-term strategy and deliver the financial targets we introduced at our Investor Conference.\n Pivoting to 2024 and moving to Slide 9. This is a look at our first quarter guidance. We are expecting first quarter sales to be up approximately 5% organically with Americas up high single digits, APAC's up mid-single digits and EMEA relatively flat. Adjusted operating profit between $200 million and $220 million and adjusted operating margin of 13.1%, up 160 basis points from last year's first quarter. And that is driven by price/cost tailwinds and productivity programs, partially offset by continued growth investments. As you likely have noted in our slide deck, we have not provided the detailed split between price and cost/inflation for 2024. As we emphasized at our Investor Conference, our ambition is to cover all inflation, including labor inflation with price and being price cost positive is an important lever for us to attain our long-term adjusted operating margin target of 20% plus.\n As you will see on the next slide, we fully expect to be price/cost positive in 2024, and we expect that to be the case each year going forward. We will continue to price our products commensurate with the increasing value we provide our customers. However, for commercial and competitive reasons, we are not disclosing the specific quantified pricing figure going forward, but rest assured, that commercial excellence actions are a core tenet to our continued profit improvement program, and we believe we are well positioned in a favorable market to continue to execute upon our long-term plans.\n Next, turning to Slide 10, our full year guidance, higher across all metrics from the view presented at our November Investor Conference. Organic net sales growth is expected to be 9% to 11%, up from the 8% to 10% we shared in November. We are increasing the midpoint for adjusted operating profit from $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion with adjusted operating margin at 17.1%,  well above the previously established midterm target of 16%. And as a reminder, our long-term margin target is 20% plus, and we believe we will take all the necessary next steps in '24 on our path towards that target. \n Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.23 at the midpoint is approximately 25% higher than 2023, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and partially offset by taxes and a higher share count as the higher share price drives more accounting dilution for employee stock options. We have included some estimates for share repurchases and share price in our estimated '24 diluted share count, but we are not prepared at this point to share specifics for either but we believe the 393 million shares estimate for full year diluted share count is a reasonable and balanced guidance, but certainly subject to change based upon several variables.\n Moving to the right on this slide. We are projecting adjusted free cash flow between $800 million and $850 million, representing 94% adjusted free cash flow conversion at the midpoint. As mentioned, this is lower than 2023 conversion primarily due to assumptions with deferred revenue and higher investment in CapEx. And finally, as we introduced at our Investor Conference, there will be a couple of external reporting changes in 2024 to align with how we run the business.\n We summarized these changes on Slide 31 in the appendix, and we have provided a historical recasting for these changes going back to 2020 in Exhibit 99.2 of our earnings release. And with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you. Thanks a lot, David. And we go to Slide 11. Thank you. You saw this slide at our Investor Conference. We are the market leader in thermal management for data centers. We have the most complete portfolio of thermal management solutions, including liquid cooling to lead the industry as a transition to GPU accelerate. We can do this customizing at scale, and we believe in a very strong position.\n This slide here shows also our high-density liquid cooling portfolio. In November, the technology was both owned and partnership-based, now it's fully owned. \n We can go to Slide 12. The 8th of December, we closed the acquisition of CoolTera, which has industry-leading liquid cooling technology. We have now secured that technology with full ownership. We have been close partners of CoolTera for years.  Now take CoolTera's premier technology, certified and approved by key chip manufacturers, along with established customer relationships, combine that with Vertiv's reach and you can scale the technology at a pace that will support our customers' aggressive AI deployment plans. We have already started to manufacture CoolTera's CDUs in one of the Vertiv plants, and we expect to have capacity quadrupled by the end of Q1.\n We are executing on a plan to scale the production of our liquid cooling solutions more than 40 times by the end of this year. We truly want to make sure we have capacity to cover the most aggressive GPU growth scenarios. That is what Vertiv means by scaling technology, activating our global manufacturing and supply chain footprint.\n Let's go now to Slide 13. This is where we obsessively focus to deliver another very good year. It starts with the customers. We plan to continue leveraging our far-reaching and deep customer relationships and have the technology, the portfolio, the innovation and the capacity to meet their demand. We spoke about the capacity expansion underways. We have allocated additional investments to CapEx to support our customers. Global scale matters and will continue to differentiate us. Vertical Operating System is foundational across the organization, helping us to realize productivity improvements in general and given us a speed. We have started to make progress on trade working capital, but there is more work to do. We are not optimized. It continues to have my full attention, and we are improving. \n Our capital deployment framework provides much flexibility driven by good cash flow generation. So a lot to do in 2024. And the short work is fully underway to continue to execute well on all these focus areas. \n Now to Slide 14. We started 2024 in a strong positions. Orders in Q1, backlog at the end of the year were very strong. Orders in Q4, backlog at the end of the year were very strong. End markets continue to signal strong and increasing demand for the foreseeable future certainly driven by AI. We expect to have the capacity to support our customers, that is our commitment to them. Investments in capacity and R&D to support the growth of the business will continue.\n Our foundation is stronger today than ever before. Our focus area will continue to strengthen that foundation and increase the resiliency of the organization to navigate, again, an increasingly complicated world. VOS, Vertiv Operating System is a cornerstone for that, a robust, resilient operating system deployed globally.\n I am pleased with the progress, but I see even more opportunity than I did when I stepped into the CEO role, much more. There is work to do, and we look forward to updating you on our progress, and we look forward to your questions now. So over to the operator. And thank you very much. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have the first question from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: Just a question on -- we've got a lot of questions this morning on the pace of savings that you guys are forecasting for next year is just on a net basis, it's just material slowdown versus 2023. And also the big question we got, what kind of pricing. And I know you're not going to talk about it for competitive reasons, but you have disclosed pricing for 2023. So if we sort of plug in any sort of reasonable pricing for '24 right? On a net basis, the $60 million looks fairly conservative, particularly given what you achieved even in the fourth quarter, if you could address that. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you, Andrew. I'll start. And David, if you want to chip in. I mean, we've been pretty vocal about the strength of our pricing muscle over the -- built over the last 12-plus months. It's something that continues just simply, it's just [indiscernible] have been vocal about the fact that while we continue to believe that we operate in a price favorable environment, but the marginal price gains will diminish for obvious reasons and a different inflationary environment we're in.\n But we operate -- the biggest part of our business operates in a favor from a demand supply balance environment. So we continue to count on price. The pace of that price will, again, price gains diminish, but we're confident it will continue to be positive. And I don't know if you want to add something, David. \nDavid Fallon: No, just for avoidance it out, that $60 million certainly is a price cost or price inflation number. And when we look at price cost, we include labor inflation in that number, which we have disclosed previously, that's in the $100 million range, and we certainly expect both material and freight to contribute some inflation next year. So you got to take that into consideration when you're looking at that price/cost dynamic including looking at price. \nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question on North America. You are guiding North America revenue up high single digits in the first quarter, but 22% growth in the fourth quarter, orders up 23% in the fourth quarter of '23. Is there any specific dynamic taking place in the first quarter? Why you think North America is only going to be up high single digits given the strength in the fourth quarter? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, we continue to believe that -- we believe and we have a strong business in North America pipeline is very, very encouraging. Just want to remind that the Q1 last year in North America, but -- in Americas, sorry, particularly was particularly strong. You remember, we were coming out of 2022, where we had a lot of, let me say, pent-up backlog. So that's also reason. But we feel very good about our America -- our business in America. \nOperator: We now have Lance Vitanza of TD Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: Congrats on the performance. It looks like book-to-bill not only improved in the fourth quarter, but accelerated. So I'm thinking about the organic sales growth guide for 2024, which certainly terrific in an absolute sense is obviously a lot lower than what you achieved in 2023. So I'm wondering to what extent does the guidance for '24 reflect potential bottlenecks, both from the standpoint of perhaps your customers' ability to source permitting and utility power on the one hand. And then also, of course, your own supply chain with respect to fans and IGBTs and breakers and so forth? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you, Lance. So the -- as you noticed, of course, we are very happy about our book-to-bill and our backlog. We have dynamics in the sense that certainly our second half orders '23 were strong and good. And that reflects in the way the shape of our backlog in general. We do not see a supply chain bottleneck at our end. I mean, it's never infinite, but the constraining factor, if you will, if we can call it. So is the fact that simply there's large projects and we -- large project we're talking have relatively long requested lead times from our customers.\n So it's a natural cycle. We were vocal in the past and we'll continue to be vocal that the whole industry needs to confront itself with power availability, permitting, et cetera. But I would say that in the 12, 18 months is really the natural pace of build-outs and sites, et cetera. So we pretty much deliver on what our customers' request right now. \nOperator: We now have Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: I'll keep it to 1 question. So if I'm doing the math right, it looks like $2.4 billion of orders in the quarter, up from $1.9 billion in the third quarter. I'm guessing you're going to say America is hyperscale, et cetera, but maybe just give us some context on what drove that sequential acceleration. But more importantly, can you maybe talk about the front log of the funnel, the fund log where you want to call it of opportunities you see coming up in the next quarter or two?\n And then David, just maybe just address this very specifically. You said deferred revenues will continue to grow in '24. Does that indicate that backlog continues to expand from here. \nGiordano Albertazzi: I'll start, Nigel, to answer your 3 questions in one. So clearly, we like the acceleration. We like the acceleration in orders. And the -- you remember, we were vocal about the strength of pipeline, both at the earnings call in October and in November at the Investor Day. That continues to be true. What we have positively noticed is an increased velocity in the pipeline.\n So we believe that's a capacity rate of the pipeline that will stay with us. So that is through the final continues to grow, and that's true pretty much globally, certainly for the Americas, EMEA and many parts of Asia. So we're positive about that. So we see opportunity out there. Do you want to comment on the other part of the other question? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Yes. So as it relates to deferred revenue, and I may oversimplify this, but deferred revenue can grow for 2 reasons. One, is, as you mentioned, backlog grows. The other is just improved execution and further penetrating customers with those advanced payments. And frankly, we would hope for both. But we feel pretty good that we'll see continued growth in those customer advanced payments. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: Gio, I was hoping you would talk about -- I think you talked about AI activity broadly in line, if not slightly better than you had expected, and that's the way you described it. Can you maybe just talk about -- and I realize you said it's not easy for you to be precise, but how much of your orders or your backlog you think are AI-driven today?\n And as you engage with these cloud customers, do you see them sort of preferring more the route of direct-to chip or full immersion? Just sort of love to get clever what your customers are looking to build their data center technology with as they go forward? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you, and a good day to you. As I said in the couple of occasions, it's very hard for us, and I think for everyone truly to be exact. It's not an exactly as I said in -- where we're going through the slides, not exact signs deciding what goes to or being sure of what goes through AI applications or not. As I said, there are some product lines that are univocally destined to high-density GPU AI like, any sort of high-density cooling or liquid cooling, some elements of in rack power distribution.\n But so to say, we want to make sure that we don't go to the side of too much detail, too much details also from a competitive standpoint. But we are very happy about the trajectory of the backlog and the trajectory of the pipeline. But the vast majority of -- the vast majority of our portfolio is really fungible, as I said, in the sense that also a lot of what you see built today and designed today is not univocally one or the other.\n It is data centers that needs to be hybrid in their very nature because they will host both traditional, let's say, CPU and GPU with configurations that may and will actually change over time. So the mix of loads in the same data center changes.\n The challenge here for all in the industry, and that's why we operate very, very strongly with the hyperscalers and the largest colors is how do you design it in a way that you can transition that way? How can you build that intrinsic flexibility there? So that's why it's very difficult for me to answer in a credible way to your question.\n And I would invite the entire industry to be less [ biunivocally ] black and white on this because I don't think you can. Having said that, we're very happy about the trajectory. We are very happy about the trajectory of what is univocally destined to AI, but also the pull-through of what we now believe, see is AI-driven medium, long term in our pipeline.\n Direct or [ emotion ]? That's what we hear. In spades, that's the discussions that we have predominantly with all. Does it mean that there is no room for [ emotion  ]? No, but just we just see more direct than anything else. But again, the fun part of the -- or a lot of the -- a very interesting part of our job today is that we really figure out and design with the big players across the world what the future looks like, and that is a highly cooperative activity. It was a bit long answer, sorry about that, but hopefully. \nOperator: We now have Scott Davis with Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Congratulations on the year. This might be a little hard to answer, but do you guys have a view or a vision, either one, but what percentage of the mix liquid cooling would be in a couple of years? Is it -- I'm trying to just get a sense of size and materiality of it, I think, is the question. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Scott, it's very much -- we do not deviate very much from what we were saying at Investor Day quite honestly. So if I go back to those thought process, we would see, let's say, go into a 15% to 20% of the overall let's say, thermal part over time, as that builds up. Okay. But again, it's really still a bit early. \nScott Davis: Okay. And again, I know you've got a lot of different SKUs, but can you give us a sense of your capacity utilization by region? And maybe the real question I'm trying to get at is how much did lack of capacity kind of slow down your growth in '23 or perhaps impact your growth in even the first couple of quarters here at '24 before your new capacity comes online? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Capacity and capacitization is ongoing. I would say that with the open -- the big steps were opening, talked also many times, India and Monterrey. After that, it's more of a gradual expansion, adding lines, adding chefs, improving utilization, improving output, investing more in assembly lines and tools. So in general, we do not see -- in this moment, we do not see for 2024 capacity or beyond, of course, capacity as a limiting factor not in any kind of a material fashion.\n Clearly, as I mentioned, we make capacity decisions almost on a weekly basis because never have we experienced a market that is dynamic to this extent. And I want to make sure we have kind of a very robust process to be there and to provide our customers with the right capacity. \nOperator: We now have the question from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: Maybe just coming back to the Slide 12, Gio. Just help us get our head around what exactly this means. Obviously, you're increasing capacity off a very, very low base. But if we go back to the Investor Day, you said you had $100 million of really direct AI revenue exposure. And there was another $250 million, which was kind of in that fungible category that was maybe AI, but you didn't know for sure.\n I don't think you're telling us here that $100 million is going to $4.5 billion, multiplying it by 100 by 45. But what are you telling us here? It's obviously a pretty dramatic chart. \nGiordano Albertazzi: What we are saying is that here, we will -- in the space of the 12 months, our plan is to make sure that we have the necessary demand to cover the needs -- the direct-to chip liquid cooling needs of the industry and making sure that we do not limit our ability of our customers to grow their direct-to-chip liquid cooling.\n That means that we indeed start from a relatively low base when we were talking about $100 million at Investor Day of course. That doesn't mean it's all liquid cooling, by the way. The -- we were talking about a backlog that was spread over months and quarters. So it's not necessarily a peak point realized in -- at the beginning of the year. \n The fact is we start from a low base. We believe that we'll be able to bring the capacity that the industry needs and plus, and that's done activating 3 vertical plants across all continents and with a rapidity and with a broad reach of our supply chain. So the message is, without going in exactly in the numbers for obvious reasons, but the message is we will have capacity, and we have capacity. And our -- we have the technology -- and that's why we see a lot of conversation and a lot of pipeline forming in this moment. \nOperator: We have the next question from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: Just maybe on EMEA. You guys alluded to some shipment delays that took place in the fourth quarter. And I guess, can you talk a little bit about maybe quantify that, talk about the impact if you can kind of recoup all of that in the first quarter. And talk about the quarterly cadence of growth to get to low double digits for 2024. \nGiordano Albertazzi: The line was very, very noisy. I believe -- we believe that we have understood your question. So Q4 was -- for EMEA was predominantly a question of customer readiness and site readiness, so not so much an internal capacity, but it was more us more the customer side receiving. When it comes to the sequence of quarters going into 2024 for EMEA, probably a little bit premature. We certainly will have a challenging comparison in Q1.\n So [indiscernible] this acceleration that we shared with you happen necessarily in Q1. But as I said, we are -- this and we are very happy about the pipeline, and we are happy about the example and specifically refer to our order intake in Q1. So we are quite opportunistic about it. Some noise there. Brika, you still there? \nOperator: We will move on to the next question of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Yes. Backlog grew 16% to reach a record high of $5.5 billion. Can you talk about how much of the backlog is supporting sales in 2024? And how much is for 2025? And as you think about the order of backlog strength, does that imply that in the next few years, where this revenue would be at the higher end or maybe even above the 8% to 11% long-term revenue CAGR target provided at the Investor Day? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Our long-term, let's say, vision stays -- stays what we shared with you at Investor Day. And of course, with a good Q4 under our belt. Backlog 16%, obviously something that makes us certainly very happy and that is heading in the right direction. When it comes to the -- this year vis-a-vis future years or next year and future years, I would say that we do not see a distribution that is anyway much difference than what we saw a year ago in the same condition. So I would say pretty natural -- pretty regular split, let's say, this year and next year. Is the backlog good? Yes, is the backlog, let's say, encouraging? Absolutely, absolutely.\n You saw -- you know our long-term view. You have your -- our 2024 plan. And yes. \nOperator: We now have Sahil Manocha of Citi. \nSahil Manocha: This is Sahil Manocha on for Andy Kaplowitz. It's now been roughly 3 months since the CoolTera transaction, and you mentioned that asset integration and vigorous production acceleration will continue through 2024. To the extent possible, could you please clarify the impact of the CoolTera acquisition has had on the '24 guide since the Analyst Day was pre-acquisition. More specifically, what is the revenue and cost impact of the CoolTera acquisition on the '24 guide? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We closed CoolTera acquisition on the 8th of December. So yes, it's not 3 months yet. But yes, I would tell you that our plan and our Investor Day vision of the future included certainly an important acceleration in liquid cooling and AI. It was already part of our portfolio. The difference is with the acquisition and one may think that we probably kind of aware that things would may have evolved that direction on the 29th of November.\n But that gives us, again, more, let's say, confidence in the ability and the speed to execute on that plan. So nothing revolutionary, nothing dramatically different is -- are we in a better position because we have secured something that was likely but not sure? Yes, absolutely. \nSahil Manocha: And just one more. I see that your views for the Communications segment end market was unchanged, and you mentioned that CapEx remains tight. Could you please provide a bit more color on what you're seeing in the end market in terms of outlook for '24. How are you seeing the still elevated rate environment impact your telecom-related customers? Any further color there would be much appreciated. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. The telecom is, let's say, it ebbs and flows depending on the technology waves. 5G, of qcourse, created acceleration a few years ago and then slowed down. And that's typically the type of cycle that business is. We do not see any imminent cycles and hence, we continue to believe that, that market will be pretty slow. We do not think that would be shrinking.\n In the future, there will be new technology, new acceleration, certainly an area where a very distributed edge could, at a certain stage, have a positive impact, and we're there with the technology, with the presence with the go-to-market, with the capacity. But again, in our guide and our vision for the future, we are very prudent with this space. \nOperator: You now have Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: The -- just a question on the orders outlook. I mean do you guys expect to grow orders in 2024? And I think you said you'd grow that deferred balance, but it would be growing just slower than the 80% that you saw this year? And then I have a follow-up. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes, we believe that orders will grow. We started, of course, mentioning that Q1 will be sequentially up sorry, it will be year-on-year up, not sequentially -- year-on-year up in high teens, as explained during the slide show. But we believe that overall the year will be up. \nC. Stephen Tusa: And the deferred balance? And then I have a follow-up to that. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. We would generally expect that deferred balance to be very much correlated with the growth of sales or orders, one being the proxy for the other. So we would expect growth in that account commensurate with what we see the growth being in both orders and sales. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Got it. And I appreciate you guys talking about pricing in a little bit more of a sensitive way. But then you were pretty clear that like supply/demand remains relatively favorable. You guys are offering greater value for the customer. Are you guys planning on getting just roughly any sequential price increases in orders this year? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We are talking about an environment going forward with price cost is up. And we believe in an environment in which price remains positive, as I explained. That necessarily translates in the same equation being true for orders. Otherwise, that would be a short-lived statement. \nC. Stephen Tusa: But I guess is there any time this year that you would expect price declines in orders year-over-year? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We do not expect that. \nOperator: We have the next question from Nigel Coe, a follow-up, of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: Thanks for the second part of the cherry here. So yes, my question is actually partially addressed by Jeff but the 45x increase in capacity on the CoolTera CDUs, mean any kind of conservative read of your current capabilities would suggest you're planning for $1 billion plus kind of revenue line here in 2025. Just wondering if that complete your base. But just more broadly, on capacity, it seems to me that adding second shift would be a big meaningful increase in your capacity capabilities. So just curious what you're seeing and what you're doing along partnerships across your overall footprint. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Sure. Let me start. I'm not sure I fully -- I heard you very well on the first part of the other question. But when it comes to capacity, it's never adding a second shift or when I say they're adding more shifts in general, adding more capacity, utilization of the asset. So think about our capacity increase as exactly a combination of more net-net, more square feet, square meters, more utilization, investment going up. And you have seen our CapEx projections go up year-on-year.\n And there is VOS, Vertiv Operating System productivity certainly plays a big role, and there is an ability to utilize more the capacity that at any given instance, we have available, and this is not different from what we shared already in October and indeed at Investor Day. So there is flexibility in that respect and flexibility we are using. But the first part, I couldn't capture very well, so real quick as we're at time. Can you ask again? \nNigel Coe: Yes, look, Slide 12, the 45x increase. It seems like $1 billion plus of capacity is what you'll point to here, but just wondering if there's any more detail on that. \nGiordano Albertazzi: So I think we are reading too much into that, read it like the industry has a growth rate in direct-to- chip. We want to make sure that we provide capacity over and above that growth rate so that whatever the industry needs, we will be able to cover that. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Giordano Albertazzi for any closing remarks. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you. Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. And looking forward to more interaction in the next few days. I want to thank the Vertiv team globally, hard work in 2023, and we have executed well. We -- as we mentioned a few times in the recent past and continues to do, we are shifting our culture towards high-performance culture.\n It doesn't happen overnight, but certainly happening at Vertiv gradually, a lot more to do. We are heading in the right direction. We started to develop the right sense of urgency across the organization, and you can see that. As I like to say, I'm pleased, but absolutely never satisfied. Good year 2023. Looking forward for a stronger year yet, in 2024. A lot of potential, very excited. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we'll speak soon. \nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you all again for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter financial results. We finished the year quite strong. Our organic net sales increased 12%, 5% from volume, 7% from price. And America continues to be the growth engine, which Americas was up 22% in the quarter. Our sales performance was within guidance range, but slightly below midpoint which was mainly attributable to a weaker China and some project delays in EMEA.\n Adjusted operating profit was $330 million, up $120 million from last year's fourth quarter and that was mainly driven by favorable price cost and the higher volume. We beat the midpoint of our implied fourth quarter adjusted operating profit guidance based upon good commercial execution and material inflation below our modeled assumptions.\n Our adjusted operating margin was 17.7% in the quarter, a 500-basis-point improvement compared to last year. And that certainly was driven by our continued relentless focus on operational execution, and that clearly showed in the results. As we move to the right, our fourth quarter GAAP diluted EPS includes a $115 million nonrecurring tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance, and we have removed that from adjusted diluted EPS. And we provide additional detail on that valuation allowance release on Page 28 in the appendix. But otherwise, the year-over-year increase in adjusted diluted EPS was driven by higher adjusted operating profit. \n To the far right, another very strong quarter for adjusted free cash flow as we generated $305 million in the quarter, more than doubling last year. Certainly, higher profitability contributed to this result, but working capital is also an important part of the story with plenty of opportunity for continued improvement. As Gio mentioned net leverage declined to 1.9x within our target long-term leverage range of 1 to 2x and down from 5.6x at the end of 2022. This leverage level supports the capital deployment framework provided at our investor conference and gives us significant flexibility and optionality to deploy excess cash.\n Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter segment results. The Americas region, as I mentioned, continues to fuel the growth engine with organic net sales up 22% in the quarter. The improvement in adjusted operating margin in the Americas continues, up 640 basis points from last year to 26.9%, with the increase primarily driven by favorable price cost and fixed cost leverage.\n APAC sales increased 3% organically, but continues to be weighed down by China, where sales were relatively flat year-over-year, but below expectations included in our quarterly guidance. APAC adjusted operating margin declined 220 points with unfavorable mix and the timing of fixed cost contributory factors. \n EMEA grew 1% organically in the fourth quarter, which was lower than anticipated primarily due to delays on several larger projects. However, we did see an 18% sequential sales increase from the third quarter, which is encouraging and EMEA experienced strong year-over-year fourth quarter orders growth, both which provides confidence for us to project low double-digit organic growth in EMEA for full year 2024. EMEA delivered strong adjusted operating margin of 28.3% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 750 basis points from last year's fourth quarter, although they did benefit from a $6 million nonrecurring gain from an asset sale in the quarter. And as Anand Sanghi, our Americas President, has emphatically reminded us, without that gain, the adjusted operating margin for the Americas and EMEA would have been approximately the same as those 2 regions continue to push each other for highest regional adjusted operating margin.\n Next, turning to Page 8, a summary of full year 2023. I can safely say it was a very strong year. It's always a good thing when the orange bars on this slide are significantly higher than the gray bars and that is the case for all financial metrics for this past year. 2023 produced a step function change in financial performance from 2022 that is not often seen in a 12-month period. This significant improvement is a result of a relentless focus on operational execution, which very clearly reads directly through -- to our financial results. \n Our full year organic sales up 21%, reflects a great position in a strong end market. Adjusted operating margin of 15.3%, an improvement of 760 basis points from last year, certainly provides a strong foundation to surpass our midterm adjusted operating margin target of 16%, which we expect to do in 2024, with about 110 basis points to spare at the midpoint. \n We did well in converting the improved profitability to cash with an over $1 billion improvement year-over-year. And let me repeat that, an over $1 billion improvement in adjusted free cash flow year-over-year, with this improvement driven by the higher profitability and improved working capital management while continuing to invest in CapEx to support growth.\n Adjusted free cash flow of $778 million drove an adjusted free cash flow conversion of 114%, with this improved conversion benefiting from a significant increase in deferred revenue primarily from advanced customer payments, which increased $280 million or 80% in the year, while sales were up 21%, which we estimate contributed about 30 percentage points to that conversion. While we expect continued growth in deferred revenue, there are many market dynamics at play, and we should not expect similar growth in 2024, which is one of the primary reasons we are guiding to adjusted free cash flow conversion in the low to mid-90s for full year 2024.\n We have much work to do, and there's plenty of opportunity for continued improvement, but 2023 certainly demonstrates our potential and helps build credibility and confidence that we can execute upon our long-term strategy and deliver the financial targets we introduced at our Investor Conference.\n Pivoting to 2024 and moving to Slide 9. This is a look at our first quarter guidance. We are expecting first quarter sales to be up approximately 5% organically with Americas up high single digits, APAC's up mid-single digits and EMEA relatively flat. Adjusted operating profit between $200 million and $220 million and adjusted operating margin of 13.1%, up 160 basis points from last year's first quarter. And that is driven by price/cost tailwinds and productivity programs, partially offset by continued growth investments. As you likely have noted in our slide deck, we have not provided the detailed split between price and cost/inflation for 2024. As we emphasized at our Investor Conference, our ambition is to cover all inflation, including labor inflation with price and being price cost positive is an important lever for us to attain our long-term adjusted operating margin target of 20% plus.\n As you will see on the next slide, we fully expect to be price/cost positive in 2024, and we expect that to be the case each year going forward. We will continue to price our products commensurate with the increasing value we provide our customers. However, for commercial and competitive reasons, we are not disclosing the specific quantified pricing figure going forward, but rest assured, that commercial excellence actions are a core tenet to our continued profit improvement program, and we believe we are well positioned in a favorable market to continue to execute upon our long-term plans.\n Next, turning to Slide 10, our full year guidance, higher across all metrics from the view presented at our November Investor Conference. Organic net sales growth is expected to be 9% to 11%, up from the 8% to 10% we shared in November. We are increasing the midpoint for adjusted operating profit from $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion with adjusted operating margin at 17.1%,  well above the previously established midterm target of 16%. And as a reminder, our long-term margin target is 20% plus, and we believe we will take all the necessary next steps in '24 on our path towards that target. \n Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.23 at the midpoint is approximately 25% higher than 2023, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and partially offset by taxes and a higher share count as the higher share price drives more accounting dilution for employee stock options. We have included some estimates for share repurchases and share price in our estimated '24 diluted share count, but we are not prepared at this point to share specifics for either but we believe the 393 million shares estimate for full year diluted share count is a reasonable and balanced guidance, but certainly subject to change based upon several variables.\n Moving to the right on this slide. We are projecting adjusted free cash flow between $800 million and $850 million, representing 94% adjusted free cash flow conversion at the midpoint. As mentioned, this is lower than 2023 conversion primarily due to assumptions with deferred revenue and higher investment in CapEx. And finally, as we introduced at our Investor Conference, there will be a couple of external reporting changes in 2024 to align with how we run the business.\n We summarized these changes on Slide 31 in the appendix, and we have provided a historical recasting for these changes going back to 2020 in Exhibit 99.2 of our earnings release. And with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. No, just for avoidance it out, that $60 million certainly is a price cost or price inflation number. And when we look at price cost, we include labor inflation in that number, which we have disclosed previously, that's in the $100 million range, and we certainly expect both material and freight to contribute some inflation next year. So you got to take that into consideration when you're looking at that price/cost dynamic including looking at price. Yes. Yes. So as it relates to deferred revenue, and I may oversimplify this, but deferred revenue can grow for 2 reasons. One, is, as you mentioned, backlog grows. The other is just improved execution and further penetrating customers with those advanced payments. And frankly, we would hope for both. But we feel pretty good that we'll see continued growth in those customer advanced payments. Yes. We would generally expect that deferred balance to be very much correlated with the growth of sales or orders, one being the proxy for the other. So we would expect growth in that account commensurate with what we see the growth being in both orders and sales."

            "name": "Giordano Albertazzi",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Dave. Thanks a lot. As Dave mentioned, our stock was up 252% last year. And as they said, if we were in the S&P 500, we would have been the top performing stock. We believe we meet the criteria, and we believe Vertiv is a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion. \n Let's go to Slide 3. We finished the year strong. Operational execution continues to improve. Q4 sales were up 12% organically. Growth continues to be led by the Americas. Orders grew 23% year-on-year and 18% sequentially, good across all regions. Additionally, book-to-bill was very strong at 1.3x, a demonstration of market strength that gives us confidence in what we believe will be a strong demand environment for '24 and beyond. \n Adjusted operating profit of $330 million and adjusted operating margin of 17.7%, clearly a step function improvement and a demonstration of our sharpened operational execution. Our adjusted free cash flow was $305 million for a full year at $778 million, resulting in more than $1 billion improvement year-on-year. Our net leverage at the end of the year was 1.9x. So within our target range of 1x to 2x, and we were upgraded by both Moody's and S&P in December. \n In December, we announced the acquisition of CoolTera that further strengthens our technology leadership in high-density and liquid cooling. More to come on that in a few slides. \n I'm pleased with the strong foundation. As we enter 2024, coupled with strong market demand, we feel good about our trajectory for the year and beyond. \n And let's move to Slide 4. We take a look at the market environment here, and it's pretty consistent with what we have been seeing for a while. Cloud hyperscale continues to lead the growth with tangible signs of AI deployment and very strong build plans. We continue to see encouraging signs in enterprise with customers starting to develop AI plans for the business, be it either on-prem or cloud. Either way, it's good for Vertiv. Telecom, not a lot of news here. CapEx is tight and mainly focused on retrofit. \n From a regional standpoint, APAC remains soft, but continues to be a story of China and the rest of Asia. The China market continues to be weak, but we saw some small positive signs in terms of orders. We don't think the market is getting weaker, but recovery is slow paced, if at all. In the rest of Asia, including India, we see significant investments happening across the market. Cloud colocation are certainly leading the pack, but enterprise customers are also investing. \n We moved commercial and industrial to green in APAC, really driven by India. The investment in infrastructure are accelerating. The India market is quite exciting, and we are well positioned. Overall, our pipeline formation is good and particularly strong in the colo hyperscale segment. Let's go to the next slide, Slide 5. I am pleased with the order strength we saw in Q4, 23% year-on-year and 18% sequentially. We entered '24 influenced by a strong 2H '23 booking, driven by large projects, reflecting also demand from AI. \n We continue to post record backlog which was up about $0.5 billion from the end of Q3, good visibility for '24 and beyond. We expect Q1 '24 orders to continue to be strong up in the high teens on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter across the portfolio. We anticipate they will be down sequentially from Q4. This is just a normal business pattern. We are working in close collaboration with our customers and suppliers to make sure we have the capacity in place to support the likely strong demand environment for the foreseeable future. We inaugurated a new thermal management plant in India. \n We have significant capacity expansion underway for switchgear and busbars across the thermal portfolio, including, of course, liquid cooling. As I mentioned at Investor Day, on a weekly basis, we look at evolving demand scenarios in a disciplined, rigorous and focused way to make timely investment decisions. The backlog for AI orders continues to grow robustly. The acceleration of the overall order book related to AI is never an exact science, as I explained, matches the expected growth rate for the application, i.e. a growth uplift of 3% to 4% to the overall market, as we mentioned in November.\n I continue to caution what is and what is not AI is fungible to a certain extent. What matters is that we believe that traction is consistent with the market uplift from AI or perhaps a bit ahead, given our strong position in thermal and thermal is a clear differentiator. Continuing on the right side of Slide 5, we believe that supply chains have largely returned to normal, but I'd say normal in a post-pandemic world.\n We are focused on making sure that resiliency is constantly increasing across the supply chain to weather what a quite complicated world can throw at us. So a lot of focus here. Looking at material inflation, we expect materials pricing to be relatively stable year-on-year, but we are very mindful that things can change rapidly. And with that, over to you, David. Well, thank you. Thanks a lot, David. And we go to Slide 11. Thank you. You saw this slide at our Investor Conference. We are the market leader in thermal management for data centers. We have the most complete portfolio of thermal management solutions, including liquid cooling to lead the industry as a transition to GPU accelerate. We can do this customizing at scale, and we believe in a very strong position.\n This slide here shows also our high-density liquid cooling portfolio. In November, the technology was both owned and partnership-based, now it's fully owned. \n We can go to Slide 12. The 8th of December, we closed the acquisition of CoolTera, which has industry-leading liquid cooling technology. We have now secured that technology with full ownership. We have been close partners of CoolTera for years.  Now take CoolTera's premier technology, certified and approved by key chip manufacturers, along with established customer relationships, combine that with Vertiv's reach and you can scale the technology at a pace that will support our customers' aggressive AI deployment plans. We have already started to manufacture CoolTera's CDUs in one of the Vertiv plants, and we expect to have capacity quadrupled by the end of Q1.\n We are executing on a plan to scale the production of our liquid cooling solutions more than 40 times by the end of this year. We truly want to make sure we have capacity to cover the most aggressive GPU growth scenarios. That is what Vertiv means by scaling technology, activating our global manufacturing and supply chain footprint.\n Let's go now to Slide 13. This is where we obsessively focus to deliver another very good year. It starts with the customers. We plan to continue leveraging our far-reaching and deep customer relationships and have the technology, the portfolio, the innovation and the capacity to meet their demand. We spoke about the capacity expansion underways. We have allocated additional investments to CapEx to support our customers. Global scale matters and will continue to differentiate us. Vertical Operating System is foundational across the organization, helping us to realize productivity improvements in general and given us a speed. We have started to make progress on trade working capital, but there is more work to do. We are not optimized. It continues to have my full attention, and we are improving. \n Our capital deployment framework provides much flexibility driven by good cash flow generation. So a lot to do in 2024. And the short work is fully underway to continue to execute well on all these focus areas. \n Now to Slide 14. We started 2024 in a strong positions. Orders in Q1, backlog at the end of the year were very strong. Orders in Q4, backlog at the end of the year were very strong. End markets continue to signal strong and increasing demand for the foreseeable future certainly driven by AI. We expect to have the capacity to support our customers, that is our commitment to them. Investments in capacity and R&D to support the growth of the business will continue.\n Our foundation is stronger today than ever before. Our focus area will continue to strengthen that foundation and increase the resiliency of the organization to navigate, again, an increasingly complicated world. VOS, Vertiv Operating System is a cornerstone for that, a robust, resilient operating system deployed globally.\n I am pleased with the progress, but I see even more opportunity than I did when I stepped into the CEO role, much more. There is work to do, and we look forward to updating you on our progress, and we look forward to your questions now. So over to the operator. And thank you very much. Thank you, Andrew. I'll start. And David, if you want to chip in. I mean, we've been pretty vocal about the strength of our pricing muscle over the -- built over the last 12-plus months. It's something that continues just simply, it's just [indiscernible] have been vocal about the fact that while we continue to believe that we operate in a price favorable environment, but the marginal price gains will diminish for obvious reasons and a different inflationary environment we're in.\n But we operate -- the biggest part of our business operates in a favor from a demand supply balance environment. So we continue to count on price. The pace of that price will, again, price gains diminish, but we're confident it will continue to be positive. And I don't know if you want to add something, David. Well, we continue to believe that -- we believe and we have a strong business in North America pipeline is very, very encouraging. Just want to remind that the Q1 last year in North America, but -- in Americas, sorry, particularly was particularly strong. You remember, we were coming out of 2022, where we had a lot of, let me say, pent-up backlog. So that's also reason. But we feel very good about our America -- our business in America. Thank you, Lance. So the -- as you noticed, of course, we are very happy about our book-to-bill and our backlog. We have dynamics in the sense that certainly our second half orders '23 were strong and good. And that reflects in the way the shape of our backlog in general. We do not see a supply chain bottleneck at our end. I mean, it's never infinite, but the constraining factor, if you will, if we can call it. So is the fact that simply there's large projects and we -- large project we're talking have relatively long requested lead times from our customers.\n So it's a natural cycle. We were vocal in the past and we'll continue to be vocal that the whole industry needs to confront itself with power availability, permitting, et cetera. But I would say that in the 12, 18 months is really the natural pace of build-outs and sites, et cetera. So we pretty much deliver on what our customers' request right now. I'll start, Nigel, to answer your 3 questions in one. So clearly, we like the acceleration. We like the acceleration in orders. And the -- you remember, we were vocal about the strength of pipeline, both at the earnings call in October and in November at the Investor Day. That continues to be true. What we have positively noticed is an increased velocity in the pipeline.\n So we believe that's a capacity rate of the pipeline that will stay with us. So that is through the final continues to grow, and that's true pretty much globally, certainly for the Americas, EMEA and many parts of Asia. So we're positive about that. So we see opportunity out there. Do you want to comment on the other part of the other question? Thank you, and a good day to you. As I said in the couple of occasions, it's very hard for us, and I think for everyone truly to be exact. It's not an exactly as I said in -- where we're going through the slides, not exact signs deciding what goes to or being sure of what goes through AI applications or not. As I said, there are some product lines that are univocally destined to high-density GPU AI like, any sort of high-density cooling or liquid cooling, some elements of in rack power distribution.\n But so to say, we want to make sure that we don't go to the side of too much detail, too much details also from a competitive standpoint. But we are very happy about the trajectory of the backlog and the trajectory of the pipeline. But the vast majority of -- the vast majority of our portfolio is really fungible, as I said, in the sense that also a lot of what you see built today and designed today is not univocally one or the other.\n It is data centers that needs to be hybrid in their very nature because they will host both traditional, let's say, CPU and GPU with configurations that may and will actually change over time. So the mix of loads in the same data center changes.\n The challenge here for all in the industry, and that's why we operate very, very strongly with the hyperscalers and the largest colors is how do you design it in a way that you can transition that way? How can you build that intrinsic flexibility there? So that's why it's very difficult for me to answer in a credible way to your question.\n And I would invite the entire industry to be less [ biunivocally ] black and white on this because I don't think you can. Having said that, we're very happy about the trajectory. We are very happy about the trajectory of what is univocally destined to AI, but also the pull-through of what we now believe, see is AI-driven medium, long term in our pipeline.\n Direct or [ emotion ]? That's what we hear. In spades, that's the discussions that we have predominantly with all. Does it mean that there is no room for [ emotion  ]? No, but just we just see more direct than anything else. But again, the fun part of the -- or a lot of the -- a very interesting part of our job today is that we really figure out and design with the big players across the world what the future looks like, and that is a highly cooperative activity. It was a bit long answer, sorry about that, but hopefully. Scott, it's very much -- we do not deviate very much from what we were saying at Investor Day quite honestly. So if I go back to those thought process, we would see, let's say, go into a 15% to 20% of the overall let's say, thermal part over time, as that builds up. Okay. But again, it's really still a bit early. Capacity and capacitization is ongoing. I would say that with the open -- the big steps were opening, talked also many times, India and Monterrey. After that, it's more of a gradual expansion, adding lines, adding chefs, improving utilization, improving output, investing more in assembly lines and tools. So in general, we do not see -- in this moment, we do not see for 2024 capacity or beyond, of course, capacity as a limiting factor not in any kind of a material fashion.\n Clearly, as I mentioned, we make capacity decisions almost on a weekly basis because never have we experienced a market that is dynamic to this extent. And I want to make sure we have kind of a very robust process to be there and to provide our customers with the right capacity. What we are saying is that here, we will -- in the space of the 12 months, our plan is to make sure that we have the necessary demand to cover the needs -- the direct-to chip liquid cooling needs of the industry and making sure that we do not limit our ability of our customers to grow their direct-to-chip liquid cooling.\n That means that we indeed start from a relatively low base when we were talking about $100 million at Investor Day of course. That doesn't mean it's all liquid cooling, by the way. The -- we were talking about a backlog that was spread over months and quarters. So it's not necessarily a peak point realized in -- at the beginning of the year. \n The fact is we start from a low base. We believe that we'll be able to bring the capacity that the industry needs and plus, and that's done activating 3 vertical plants across all continents and with a rapidity and with a broad reach of our supply chain. So the message is, without going in exactly in the numbers for obvious reasons, but the message is we will have capacity, and we have capacity. And our -- we have the technology -- and that's why we see a lot of conversation and a lot of pipeline forming in this moment. The line was very, very noisy. I believe -- we believe that we have understood your question. So Q4 was -- for EMEA was predominantly a question of customer readiness and site readiness, so not so much an internal capacity, but it was more us more the customer side receiving. When it comes to the sequence of quarters going into 2024 for EMEA, probably a little bit premature. We certainly will have a challenging comparison in Q1.\n So [indiscernible] this acceleration that we shared with you happen necessarily in Q1. But as I said, we are -- this and we are very happy about the pipeline, and we are happy about the example and specifically refer to our order intake in Q1. So we are quite opportunistic about it. Some noise there. Brika, you still there? Our long-term, let's say, vision stays -- stays what we shared with you at Investor Day. And of course, with a good Q4 under our belt. Backlog 16%, obviously something that makes us certainly very happy and that is heading in the right direction. When it comes to the -- this year vis-a-vis future years or next year and future years, I would say that we do not see a distribution that is anyway much difference than what we saw a year ago in the same condition. So I would say pretty natural -- pretty regular split, let's say, this year and next year. Is the backlog good? Yes, is the backlog, let's say, encouraging? Absolutely, absolutely.\n You saw -- you know our long-term view. You have your -- our 2024 plan. And yes. We closed CoolTera acquisition on the 8th of December. So yes, it's not 3 months yet. But yes, I would tell you that our plan and our Investor Day vision of the future included certainly an important acceleration in liquid cooling and AI. It was already part of our portfolio. The difference is with the acquisition and one may think that we probably kind of aware that things would may have evolved that direction on the 29th of November.\n But that gives us, again, more, let's say, confidence in the ability and the speed to execute on that plan. So nothing revolutionary, nothing dramatically different is -- are we in a better position because we have secured something that was likely but not sure? Yes, absolutely. Yes. The telecom is, let's say, it ebbs and flows depending on the technology waves. 5G, of qcourse, created acceleration a few years ago and then slowed down. And that's typically the type of cycle that business is. We do not see any imminent cycles and hence, we continue to believe that, that market will be pretty slow. We do not think that would be shrinking.\n In the future, there will be new technology, new acceleration, certainly an area where a very distributed edge could, at a certain stage, have a positive impact, and we're there with the technology, with the presence with the go-to-market, with the capacity. But again, in our guide and our vision for the future, we are very prudent with this space. Yes, we believe that orders will grow. We started, of course, mentioning that Q1 will be sequentially up sorry, it will be year-on-year up, not sequentially -- year-on-year up in high teens, as explained during the slide show. But we believe that overall the year will be up. We are talking about an environment going forward with price cost is up. And we believe in an environment in which price remains positive, as I explained. That necessarily translates in the same equation being true for orders. Otherwise, that would be a short-lived statement. We do not expect that. Sure. Let me start. I'm not sure I fully -- I heard you very well on the first part of the other question. But when it comes to capacity, it's never adding a second shift or when I say they're adding more shifts in general, adding more capacity, utilization of the asset. So think about our capacity increase as exactly a combination of more net-net, more square feet, square meters, more utilization, investment going up. And you have seen our CapEx projections go up year-on-year.\n And there is VOS, Vertiv Operating System productivity certainly plays a big role, and there is an ability to utilize more the capacity that at any given instance, we have available, and this is not different from what we shared already in October and indeed at Investor Day. So there is flexibility in that respect and flexibility we are using. But the first part, I couldn't capture very well, so real quick as we're at time. Can you ask again? So I think we are reading too much into that, read it like the industry has a growth rate in direct-to- chip. We want to make sure that we provide capacity over and above that growth rate so that whatever the industry needs, we will be able to cover that. Well, thank you. Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. And looking forward to more interaction in the next few days. I want to thank the Vertiv team globally, hard work in 2023, and we have executed well. We -- as we mentioned a few times in the recent past and continues to do, we are shifting our culture towards high-performance culture.\n It doesn't happen overnight, but certainly happening at Vertiv gradually, a lot more to do. We are heading in the right direction. We started to develop the right sense of urgency across the organization, and you can see that. As I like to say, I'm pleased, but absolutely never satisfied. Good year 2023. Looking forward for a stronger year yet, in 2024. A lot of potential, very excited. Thanks, everyone, for joining us, and we'll speak soon."

Our stock price increased 252% in 2023, putting us well ahead of the #1 performer in all of the S&P 500, and it's up very well again so far this year. We announced the capital allocation strategy at our November investor conference is very flexible and we believe is structured well to provide additional benefits to shareowners and is a great reflection of the cash-generating capability of the company, a very nice and exceptionally promising change from where we were.\n We finished the year strong, quite strong, in fact, and we fully expect this to set us up well to continue to provide good returns for our shareowners in 2024 and beyond. So Gio and team were off to a very good start, but we still have work to do. You'll hear Gio talk about his focus areas for 2024 and what we plan to accomplish this year to deliver another good year for our investors.\n It's getting the important thing customer relationships, technology, BOS, organization resiliency, working capital and capital deployment. We've demonstrated our potential in 2023, but we still have a long way to run, and that's all upside. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded.\n I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, David Fallon.\n Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings made with the SEC.\n Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Good morning, everyone. Well, we've delivered another strong quarter, built squarely on getting the fundamentals right, good operational execution throughout the organization that translated nicely, outperforming guidance in the third quarter. I believe we're starting to see a trend and one we plan to continue.\n Financial and operating performance continues to strengthen significantly across the board. And the most exciting part of that is we're still early in our path of improvement. Alignment to great end market matters. We have a great position in a good industry, and our technology differentiation continues to strengthen. Data continues to proliferate in good times and bad times. And that portends a very favorable end market environment for the foreseeable future.\n We're intending to finish the year strong. The benefits of our [ seed ] planning are taking hold and still to be fully realized. Our end markets remain resilient. Operational execution continues to improve, and there is still a lot of runway ahead. That is a great setup as we think about 2024 and beyond. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you, Dave. In the last 12 months, we have created intense focus on operational execution, including margin improvement and cash flow generation, combined with a sense of urgency, which underpins a high-performance culture. This quarter shows progress across the board, exceeding our own expectations, demonstrating there is still more value the business can deliver.\n Here are some highlights. Third quarter sales were up 17% organically. Americas continues to lead the growth, up 40%. We continue to see headwinds in APAC, specifically in China. More on that in a few slides.\n Very pleased with our orders, up 11%, excluding FX. We were not totally surprised by the strength in orders. We have seen pipelines built, but timing is never certain. We are encouraged by the order booking acceleration. We believe this is a sign of good things to come.\n Adjusted operating profit, that was $296 million, and adjusted operating margin of 17%. Operational execution is sharpening and certainly translating into margin performance. We had another strong cash flow quarter, an area of intense focus, and we are delivering. Of course, this has a nice effect on our leverage, which was 2.4 at the end of September, and guidance gets us close to 2x by year-end.\n Given our performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year guidance. Again, we're now expecting sales for the full year to be up 21% organically, AOP between $1,020 million and $1,030 million and adjusted free cash flow of $625 million at the midpoint. A very strong year continues to unfold, and we see that momentum enduring.\n Let's turn to Slide 4. No changes on the market environment slide. Things are consistent with the picture we gave 90 days ago, healthy markets overall. The data center end market remains strong, with the cloud hyperscale and colocation continued to lead the growth. We see accelerating demand and a strong overall market for the foreseeable future.\n Different customers are at different points in their demand cycle, but they all recognize that strong future demand is coming. There are encouraging signs from enterprise. We are hearing a more positive outlook, but still balanced against some macro concerns. Telecom is still weak. Some telco carriers have delayed investments, and there is a lull in the market after a few years of a strong 5G investment.\n Regionally, APAC remains soft, mainly due to a slow Chinese market, partially offset by encouraging signs in India and rest of Asia. We don't anticipate a sharp recovery in China and expect that it will stay soft until the back end of 2024. Now the bright spot in APAC, India, is quite convincing. A lot of investment happening, and the trend is likely to continue for quite a while.\n We are also seeing good activity in Malaysia, the Philippines and Southeast Asia in general. I continue to be quite encouraged by the market signals. We are seeing the demand formation in the pipeline, in the order book, in conversations with customers all over the world.\n There's a very good seg to Slide 5. Let's go to Slide 5, please. Orders in Q3 were up 11% year-on-year and 16% sequentially. I have said throughout the year that pipeline activity is strong. We are seeing that translate into orders. So not entirely surprising, but encouraging velocity. We anticipate Q4 orders will also be positive year-on-year. I wouldn't be surprised if Q4 growth was like Q3's, velocity is increasing.\n Now we get a lot of questions on the amount of AI activity in our order book. Those questions are often formulated as binary questions. Is it AI? Or is it not AI? But there is no binary answer. If we talk about technologies that univocally are applied to high-density GPU or compute, as for example, liquid cooling, CDUs or some rack-level power distribution solutions, I will still say our order book is in the tens of millions of dollars. But many elements of our portfolio, chillers, direct expansion cooling, heat rejection systems, switchgear, busbars, UPS, you name them are -- regardless if GPU or CPU compute, high density or normal density. So the volume supporting AI or future AI-proof data centers is way larger than that tens of millions.\n Also, many data centers have been designed to be multipurpose. So the majority of our products will support many types of compute, including AI. That is the beauty of having a comprehensive portfolio of all critical infrastructure technologies across the entire span of the powertrain, the thermal chain and IT-wide space infrastructure, something that very few companies truly have.\n Different players, hyperscale, colocation but also enterprise and edge will have different approaches to AI. And now that suits us well. Complexity, customization at scale, all things we're good at. So overall, AI is coming, and we anticipate it will show up. We're in a more pronounced manner in 2024.\n Now on to supply chain. We are in a much different place than we were historically, much different. I'm not just talking about incrementally better than 90 days ago. If you look at the progress over the last year, you tangibly see this in our reduced lead times. Suppliers of key components have been making substantial capacity investments, and we are seeing the benefit. We have qualified many additional suppliers, with a sharp eye on geopolitical diversification and overall supply chain resilience. We are doing capacity locks in key areas to make sure the supply base is strong for today and for the future under various growth scenarios. We will be ready.\n Let's move to Slide 6. Here, we want to provide some additional color around capacity, an important topic given the different growth scenarios that are indeed possible. We start in a strong place, with 22 manufacturing plants around the world. It's much more believable to say you can scale with this strong starting point. The existing footprint was built with the idea that future growth would need to be accommodated. So you've seen us scale, expand existing facilities, ramp-up the 2 facilities -- the 2 new facilities to support growth.\n And we have buffer capacity in our plants today, roughly around additional 25% to support more intense growth periods and can flex across facilities to optimize our production. And of course, we continue to invest.\n Productivity is another capacity lever. The utilization and productivity opportunities are plentiful. And candidly, just starting. Vertiv's operating system is being deployed vigorously across the organization, unlocking further capacity. I enjoyed tremendously running a plant during my early years with the company. So there is a manufacturing in general is near and dear to my heart. It has my and [ there's ] a full attention.\n We'll continue to make capital investments to support growth. We will be ready for what is ahead, but this can be done in a measured way that does not significantly change the cash flow profile of this business. We can invest for growth, prudently and deliver strong free cash flow. And with that, over to you, David. \nDavid Fallon: Great. Thanks, Gio. Turning in the presentation to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. As you can see, strong financial performance continues across the board. Organic net sales up 17%, with 9% from volume and 8% from pricing. As Gio mentioned, we continue to see the Americas, which was up 40% organically, drive the growth engine, particularly in this past third quarter.\n Adjusted operating profit was $162 million higher than last year's third quarter, mainly driven by $100 million price cost benefit and $45 million of volume. Adjusted operating profit was $40-plus million higher than our prior guidance, driven by $15 million higher-than-anticipated pricing and $30 million lower inflation, as we have seen some core metals, notably steel, trending lower in the past quarter.\n We did have a onetime $7 million benefit from a commercial concession as we note on this slide that also contributed to the favorability versus prior guidance. This commercial concession also favorably influenced adjusted operating margin by 40 to 50 basis points as adjusted operating margin reached 17% in the quarter. And that's 790 basis point higher than last year, a great indicator of the significant progress we have made in a relatively short period in driving operational execution.\n Certainly more work to do, but third quarter results should provide some confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-term margin targets.\n Moving to the right on this slide. We had another strong quarter of adjusted free cash flow, generating $221 million in the quarter, a year-over-year improvement of $241 million. We continue to see the benefit of higher profitability and improved working capital management really across the organization. Cash taxes were higher, the inevitable result of driving higher profitability.\n But in general, we are driving much more consistency and predictability with our cash flow, controlling the things that matter, notably trade working capital, as we fully appreciate that sales and profitability mean little if they do not translate into cash flow, which is absolutely essential to drive long-term shareholder value.\n Last on this slide, if you look at the bottom right-hand corner, net leverage declined to 2.4x at the end of the quarter and is expected to be approximately 2.1x by year-end. Of course, this net leverage improvement certainly correlates with improved cash generation. Clearly, our balance sheet continues to strengthen, which provides flexibility as we think about capital deployment. And more to come on capital deployment in our November 29th Investor Conference.\n Next, turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. The Americas region continues its strong growth trajectory with organic net sales up 40%, including 28% from volume and 12% from pricing. We continue to see substantial year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin in the Americas, up 910 basis points, which is largely driven by favorable price cost and fixed cost leverage.\n APAC top line, moving to the center section of the graph, continues to be negatively impacted by China, with organic net sales in that region declining 7% from last year. From a subregion perspective, the rest of Asia, so everything outside of China continues to grow nicely year-over-year, up low double digits in the third quarter. Adjusted operating margin for APAC remained flat year-over-year despite the lower sales at 19.1%, really a strong testament to their focus on cost control while continuing to drive margin enhancements.\n Now we do anticipate that APAC will return to mid- to low single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, in part due to typical fourth quarter seasonality in China, but this region will likely be down for full year 2023 versus 2022. And we are not planning for a sharp recovery in China at the beginning of '24. Rather, we are expecting sales activity to be relatively muted, at least until the back half of next year.\n The EMEA region was relatively flat organically in the third quarter, which was slightly better than we anticipated in guidance. Flat year-over-year sales in the quarter was mostly due to timing, as we expect a significant sequential increase in the fourth quarter, with full year organic sales growth in that region in the upper single- to low double digits. EMEA continues to deliver strong adjusted operating margin, almost 28% this quarter, an increase of 1,030 basis points compared with last year's third quarter, with the improvement driven by favorable price/cost and good fixed cost control.\n And finally, on this page, corporate costs in the third quarter were approximately $7 million higher than last year, driven by both R&D investment and an incremental $3 million foreign exchange loss. Our current guidance assumes second half corporate costs in the aggregate to be consistent with the first half.\n Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We expect a strong finish to the year with adjusted operating profit in the range of $295 million to $305 million and adjusted operating margin at 16.3% at the midpoint, 360 basis points higher than last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be down sequentially from the 17% in the third quarter as regional mix plays a role with higher APAC volume. And recall that the third quarter was favorably impacted by the commercial concession that we talked about a couple of slides ago.\n Adjusted free cash flow is also projected to be lower sequentially as we expect CapEx to ramp up about $35 million, a lot of that driven by timing. And working capital use should be approximately $35 million higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as sales are expected to increase about $100 million sequentially.\n China cash collections are a watch item for the fourth quarter, with larger customers paying a bit slower given the macro environment there and the impact on cash availability.\n Next, moving to Slide 10, our full year guidance. We are increasing projected full year sales by approximately $30 million and adjusted operating profit to $1.20 billion to $1.30 billion, an increase of over $580 million from 2022. This revised guidance is approximately $75 million higher than previous guidance, with $40 million from the third quarter beat and $35 million from the raise in the fourth quarter.\n Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to be 15%, 730 basis points higher than last year, with approximately 500 basis points from higher variable contribution margin and over 200 basis points from fixed cost leverage. And finally, on this page, we are increasing adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million to $625 million at the midpoint, $885 million higher than last year. This improvement demonstrates our focus on cash and the operational process improvements that have taken a hold across the organization. And our commitment to delivering strong and consistent free cash flow is a crucial part of our high-performance culture, and I believe this could be a harbinger of continued good things to come.\n And with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you, David. Thanks a lot. And let's go to Slide 11.\n So some initial thoughts on 2024. I'm going to say we see more tailwinds than headwinds. Our starting point, it is a strong. The data center market continues to accelerate. And AI is forming a tailwind that will likely be more evident in 2024.\n Our supply chain resilience is at a much greater level of maturity. This is important as we think about the demand profiles that may emerge for next year and beyond. Balanced investments in the business will continue. R&D capacity, things that will support the growth of the business for the years to come. We will continue our relentless focus on operational execution and implement the Vertiv operating system increasingly deeply. This will support continuous improvement consistently. We have started making progress, but much more to come.\n There are headwinds too. Certainly, China is slow, and recovery doesn't appear near term. Worth noting, we anticipate more normal seasonality returning in 2024. And for Vertiv, that typically means our financial measures in absolute dollars get stronger sequentially as the year progresses.\n Let's go to Slide 12. Once more, remind everyone that we have our first Investor Conference on the 29th of November. So here are the topics we plan to cover that day. And we'll be sharing a lot of exciting information. I look forward to spending the day with you, talking about our strategy, technology, use on the market, operations and financial framework. We hope you will be able to join us, preferably in person, or remote.\n Let's go to Slide 13. I'd say we have meaningfully evolved from where we were a year ago. You can see that across all the key takeaways on this slide. A lot of improvement. It has been quite intense and fun, and we are still quite far from our full potential. I want to thank our team around the world for the passion and the hard work, tackling challenges every day, making sure we exceed our customer expectations, helping the entire industry scale and holding ourselves accountable for delivering strong results every quarter. I am sure you can see the early signs of a high-performing culture.\n With that, over to the operator. Over to you, Bruno. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Where -- I'm looking at Slide 11, where does telecom fit in this tailwind, headwind? Or is it the lack of kind of telecom being on here, I mean it's more of a neutral? Or just -- I don't know, I'll just stop there. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. No, Scott. I would say, Telecom is neutral right now in this whole picture. Honestly speaking, the fact that telecom is soft is no new news this quarter. That's something that we already signaled for at least the last 2 calls.\n So we see that continuing in 2024. So if anything, we can be surprised by the opposite. In the industry, there is some expectations that sooner or later, the extreme edge will happen in the, let's say, telecom perimeter operations. But again, not counting on that, but having the right technology available and the customer reach, if that happens. \nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, price. This has been an industry historically where price wasn't really a big deal until you had the -- not meaningful contributor one way or another until you had the supply chain debacle and needed to get after some. But do you have to start giving back some of that when you get into 2024? Is there a new paradigm just because your -- perhaps your kind of value-based selling and kind of figure out how to hold that -- how to hold the line on price a little bit more effectively than maybe in the past? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes, Scott. Certainly, value is a big element. The industry and the line technology is becoming more complex. We will talk certainly about high density. We'll talk about the overall net increment on installed power and the need for total cost of ownership, efficiency, et cetera.\n So the world is becoming more complex. Value in terms of the technology that you deliver matters. And we talked about Vertiv's ability to exercise the pricing muscle, both in terms of process and in terms of translating value in the initial price, both in terms of project price process and in general, pricing new technology.\n But it's also true that the industry -- in the industry in general, there is more demand than capacity. So that is certainly a favorable environment in many respects. I'm going to say that we see in the future, diminishing price gains. We have certainly enjoyed a lot of the kind of catching up after the inflation. But again, we continue to be positive about the future investor respect. \nScott Davis: Sounds encouraging. We'll see you all at the Analyst Day. Thank you. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Looking forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: Maybe we could just start with the comments that you guys made about 2024. I think it's an important distinction with 1 half versus 2 halves since the comps are really difficult in the first half. And I guess the follow-up to that comment is, do you still expect to be able to grow organically in the first half of the year? Or is that going to be totally back half weighted just because of the comp dynamic? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Nicole, as we -- as I mentioned, let me elaborate on it. As I mentioned, we are going more towards a normal is what is historically normal first half, second half. 2023 may expect a little bit abnormal in the sense that we had a pent-up backlog, let me say, almost a 2022 backlog residue that we moved because of the shortage of components, et cetera, moved to the first half of the year. So that makes certainly a more flat H1, H2 year.\n In this moment, we are thinking something that probably will be around 45%, 55% top line, first half, second half. Give and take something, it's too early to say, but that's probably the thought -- that thought process. I would be surprised, and it's again, early, but I would be surprised if H1 '24 were below 2023. So we -- I think it was going to be positive all the way through.\n But again, we'd like to be clear about the seasonality. That's all. \nNicole DeBlase: That's really helpful. And then the comments that you guys made about capacity and investing in the business. I guess, if we kind of look at the multiyear CapEx picture, are you trying to send the message that CapEx does need to grow from current levels? Or do you think that you can kind of expand capacity gradually at the current levels of spend? \nGiordano Albertazzi: There will be some CapEx growth, as a matter of fact, just as our top line grows. I mean, there will be an element of a proportionality, but probably a little bit more than that. Again, I think this is a unique trend in the industry, the main industry that we serve. And as we said, we have many ways to make sure that we make the capacity available.\n Productivity being one, we're making sure that we use everything that we have created in terms of capacity over the last couple of years. But yes, we -- if the conditions, as we believe, will favor that, we think we can be a little bit more aggressive. But I want to once more highlight the fact that we do not believe that this will materially, meaningfully change the cash flow profile of the business overall. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: Congrats on a really good set of numbers here. I guess the first one I had was, your orders accelerated really nicely, I think it was up 11% year-over-year, you sound more positive going forward on this as well. How much of this uplift do you think in orders is driven by volume versus pricing? And any sense if the duration of -- are the customers are putting in is starting to stretch out as well? And maybe that's helping also. Maybe you can talk about pricing versus volume versus duration on orders would be really helpful. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Okay. So I would say that there is a lot of volume in the orders that we've taken. As I'm saying, we are -- as we are saying, we are -- we're printing nice price numbers this year in our sales. We expect that to trim a little bit. And the growth -- the future growth will have a very good volume component.\n When it comes to the duration, I think you're asking duration in terms of how far out the orders that we are receiving and covering. And I would say it's a little bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there are shortened lead times, that I mentioned in a few occasions and also earlier today, are favorable in terms of accelerating what is the so-called run rate more territory business, which is always good, great also in terms of installed base creation for future service revenue. But we see also increasingly the big part of the -- the big players, be them hyperscalers or be them the large colocation players increasingly look out in terms of coverage. So it's really a good combination of the 2. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That is really helpful. And then if I can get your perspective on this. There's an expectation that new data center deployments will add, I don't know, 15, 20 gigawatts of incremental power consumption in the next few years. And you think about these racks going from 10 kilowatts to [ 50, 100 ]. Can you talk about what does it do to your power management side of the portfolio? Do we need a completely different set of power solutions versus what we have today? What does that imply for [indiscernible] because I think [ Edwards ] always focused on the cooling side, which is obviously incredibly positive. But I'd love to know how does it play out on the power management side as we shift into these higher density racks? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, it's an absolutely good point that -- it's a very important part of our portfolio as well as a thermal part and one that will benefit from the expansion, the acceleration, the gigawatts that you are mentioning. Fundamentally, the powertrain that we have, from medium voltage switchgear all the way to busbars and PDUs, so the entire powertrain, it's not going to change dramatic. It's just going to be more, deployed more because it's more power that needs to be transferred from the grid to the chip.\n So it's good news. It's a net volume increase. There will be some fine-tuning in what exactly happens in terms of power distribution inside the rack. Some PDU solutions will be designed for high density, but it's a relatively small portion of the total powertrain that will expand as a lot.\n The other aspect is positive for the power side of our business is that power is, as we said several times that the industry is very vocal about that, an overall constraint, power availability for new data centers. And that drives operators to think about alternative ways to power. So dynamic power solution, microgrids, battery, energy storage systems, et cetera, are all future opportunities that we are keenly looking into and for which we are cooperating with the big players in terms of proof of concepts, et cetera. Something -- a future good opportunity for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: And thank you for the preview on the Investor Day. I just want a bit more detail on the geographics. EMEA, negatives this quarter. You talked about some project delays. It looks like it's bounced back nicely in the fourth quarter. How does that break in 2024? Where do you see the [indiscernible] of strength or weakness in Europe right now, especially given the macro? And then you called out China, you're not expecting that to recover until back end of '24. But is there enough growth in India, Philippines, et cetera, to drive -- to kind of offset that in 2024? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, I think it's a little bit premature to -- no, absolutely. To be exactly [ tail on ] -- even geographics within APAC. But again, we are very encouraged from what we see in India and Southeast Asia. China, again, we, of course, continue to be a strong player in China, a strong local player in China. But we have kind of a prudent posture in the way we look at the next year.\n When it comes to EMEA, I am encouraged by the pipeline. I'm very encouraged by pipelines in EMEA and also the conversations with the various customers. And you do say that the macroeconomics are not phenomenal in EMEA. And the geopolitics are as hard as it gets. There is clearly a big question mark when it comes to the Middle East, for us, not a big part of our market. Absolutely not a big part of our, let's say, our revenue. But yes, it's -- we don't know what will happen. But overall, for what we can control, absolutely a strong position in EMEA and good pipelines. \nNigel Coe: Great. A quick one on pricing, because I think it's important to sort of like bet this because there is some concerns around price rollback. Are you seeing any price sensitivity or price-based negotiations or price-based competition across your businesses in any meaningful extent? And then maybe, David, if you could opine perhaps on the carry forward from 4Q pricing into 2024. We calculate about 2 points-plus of price carry forwards. Is that in the right zone? \nGiordano Albertazzi: So Nigel, I'll start with the general comments about the market. I mean, we will live in a commercially active world. Don't get me wrong. So different geographies, especially different types of market, different go-to markets have slightly different dynamics from a price standpoint. But overall, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to have a commercial advantage. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. And Nigel, on your question on pricing carryover, unfortunately, probably a little premature to give specific numbers that there certainly will be some benefit. It probably is not reasonable to anticipate 8% pricing every year going forward like we've seen this year and even the 7% last year. But we do anticipate to have some carryover impact. And the one thing we can safely say, it's certainly our intention going forward, even beyond, to be price/cost positive. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: So as you look at your AI -- yes, yes, as you look at your AI-related pipeline, so are we building more for new build locations? Or is it more retrofit of existing data centers? What does it look like from your perspective? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Retrofit will be an opportunity, definitely. In this moment, we predominantly but not exclusively see new build. But there is also quite encouraging conversations about retrofit. But it's -- things are very much in flux. Things are very much in flux. We participate in both conversations very actively. \nAndrew Obin: And just a follow-up. Where are you guys in terms of -- and I know these questions have sort of been asked, but U.S. capacity utilization today? And how much extra U.S. capacity would be in place by year-end '24? And the current plans. And also curious to know how flexible can you be -- and when I say you -- if I include Mexico, but how flexible can you be in pulling capacity from other regions into the U.S. as there are very different electrical standards? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. No, absolutely. I would say that the general plus-25% that we were signaling during the slide show earlier, it's definitely applicable -- is definitely applicable to pretty much homogeneously across the world. And certainly true for the North American business as of now.\n And as I was saying, we will continue to invest. But we do have a very explicit and well-orchestrated initiative to make sure that we use and leverage the global capacity also for the U.S. It's something that we are doing already partially today in different degrees, different lines of business. But it's something that we will be able to accelerate and accentuate as we go ahead.\n In terms of American codes versus other type of codes, that's something that -- it's just about having the right certification of a plant outside the North American or American region. And it's something that we have or that we are accelerating, depending on the technology. So it's very, very margin-focused and very much something we do and that we will accelerate going forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: I know you said that the positive order inflection you're seeing hasn't really been that unexpected. But can you talk about how you're thinking about the longevity of the current order inflection? Would you expect order growth to continue to accelerate into '24? And then how are you thinking about the duration of the up cycle? Do you see the AI contribution as sort of a big gold rush and then it flames out? Or could it last quite a long time? \nGiordano Albertazzi: The second -- the last part of your question, we believe this is a long-term trend. In a sense that we believe that AI will be pretty pervasive. And this is just the beginning. This is a multiyear, truly many years of cycle -- many years cycle, we believe. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: And Gio, maybe just in thinking about the mix of orders, you mentioned enterprise markets. Maybe some encouraging trends there. How much of the incremental order growth is from hyperscale and colo customers? Are they now a larger percentage of your orders versus enterprise? And then how would you characterize the enterprise market? You mentioned some positive signs, but obviously, rates are higher and concerns around the economy. So color would be helpful. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes, definitely, colocation and hyperscale are a very large part of our mix and our order intake. And growing actually in terms of speed of growth. So well -- very well covered there.\n What we see is that the acceleration in compute power and anyway, utilization, and volume of data that is further accentuated by AI is going to require some infrastructure also on the enterprise side of the equation. More distributed compute, more edge compute or sometimes even on-prem or proprietary data centers. So clearly, the biggest part of the acceleration is coming, and it will come from the hyperscale, colo and cloud. But we are optimistic and positive about the Enterprise business.\n Plus, the Enterprise business constitute a big portion of what I was referring to, our more distributed territory go-to-market and type of segment. And we are helped by improving lead times. We are accelerating that part of the market. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Yes. Congratulations on the good results. Hoping you could elaborate a bit more on what you're seeing in China and some of the causes of the weakness. In a related topic, to what extent you think geopolitics and export restrictions for AI could impact Vertiv in China, even if it's an indirect effect, Vertiv's own products aren't directly put on to any sort of export controllers? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. Well, we see China as really a general market situation. More so than anything to do with the export restrictions, in our case. I just want to remind everyone that no data flow through our stuff. The only thing we power and cool IT infrastructure. So clearly, the market is not strong in China right now. And we participate to the market as a very local supplier, as a very local player. The majority of our supply chain is local. So we operate as a Chinese supplier, and we move with that market. And that market in this moment is not strong. \nMark Delaney: That's helpful, Gio. and my other question is just around pricing and -- came in better than your guidance in the third quarter. There's no larger tailwinds in terms of pricing in 2023 guidance relative to what you assumed last quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more on what's been driving the pricing strength that you're seeing in 3Q and for the year? And to what extent it's more about mix or like-for-like pricing? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, again, there is a number of actions that we have implemented from a pricing standpoint. But clearly, the mix, the sequence of orders that we execute and a certain degree of being on the safe side and in guiding have all contributed to this price/cost upside. \nMark Delaney: Got it. Congrats again on the good results. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: So I just wanted to delve into the comments around the first half of next year a little more. We've been hearing that there have been some -- and you guys sound pretty confident on this in the fourth quarter, some -- not only early indications of orders for next year from hyperscalers, but like some real big orders in the last couple of weeks. And that the only real concern is like when they're going to actually want delivery, i.e., like when suppliers are going to produce.\n I'm just curious as to if you're kind of seeing that profile, if you're seeing those orders yet in that you're kind of caution on next year is just more about not knowing really when those things will ship, given that we're in kind of a very growthy and perhaps fluid situation where these guys are still figuring out the best way to go about this.\n I'm just curious as to how tangible that demand is early in October. And I think -- I don't know, it would make sense to me that you guys are talking a lot about capacity here and proving that you have the capacity, which would be juxtaposed against what I think people are viewing as a \"soft start to next year.\" I'm just trying to kind of put that all together and understand how concrete this visibility on orders is that you guys have early in the quarter here in the fourth quarter. \nGiordano Albertazzi: No, just when we're sharing the slide -- going through the slides, we have -- we expect a fourth quarter that is probably going to be up more or less the same that we think something around what we experienced in Q3. So we're quite optimistic about that.\n I would say that we should not read too much in the first half, second half. That's the normal nature of the industry. And again, it would have been the same of '23 first half, were it not for the supply constraints that marred the entire 2022 for us and for everyone else.\n So that, if anything, there was an artificial drift of backlog from, let's say, the second half of '22 to the first half of '23, that balanced the 2 halves in '23 in a way that is not so kind of normal in our type of business. So I would not read too much into it.\n We are happy about our pipeline. We're happy about the order pace. And yes, a lot of those orders will be coming from hyperscale and colo and that type of market. And really, those orders are placed today for tomorrow. Those are aligned with the big site deployments, with fairly forward-looking project plans. So I look at it as something quite normal, starting to happen again. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Right. That makes sense. And then just one last one on -- any updates on how this liquid cooling strategy is progressing? And I assume we're going to hear more about it in the 29th. But any updates there on how you guys are going about that solution? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, we are very happy by the way things are progressing in terms of portfolio, in terms of partnerships, et cetera. And yes, as I said in several occasions, we see that as -- we see this piece as additive because it's adding a link to the cooling chain, so to speak, to the thermal chain. We'll certainly have more details at Investor Day here, but pretty -- feel pretty good about what we're doing also with our partners and the biggest chip manufacturers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: And just a couple for me. I wonder if we could talk about service a little bit. Obviously isn't growing anywhere near the rate of equipment, which I think is tied to the mix of where the equipment is going. But all this talk about system integration complexity and the like, what is the prospect for kind of service growth to accelerate here or service revenue per unit or per megawatt deployed, however you might frame it? Maybe you could give us some perspective there. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. Service is accelerating for us towards a double-digit growth territory, which, of course, we like. It is in the nature of service, especially the life cycle part of service. I always like to think in terms of project services, the services that you sell with new equipment, say, and instead the life cycle, the duration of the life of the kit. The latter is very important from a profit standpoint, from a customer experience standpoint, but also very important because it compounds over time. But it's built on the installed base that we are growing.\n So we are happy about the direction. We want to accelerate further, and we'll accelerate further. But definitely, a component of service that is being able and uniquely, given our global footprint and experience, uniquely able to accompany our customers in the complexity from an installation commissioning start-up standpoint or retrofit standpoint, customer on the journey of high density, be it cooling high density, very complex. And power high density is something that, a, we are well equipped for, uniquely experienced and geographically positioned, but also getting ready for it. So I am -- I've never been more excited about our service opportunity going forward. \nJeffrey Sprague: Then maybe you could address capital deployment a little bit more, and maybe we'll hear more about that next month. But maybe your appetite for M&A, your view on whether the organization is up to digesting something else or share repurchases in the cards? Maybe just what the priorities might be? \nGiordano Albertazzi: I would say that there's certainly a very relevant question. And our Investor Day is relative -- is relatively soon about a month. And I think the best thing is to just ask you to be patient for us -- with us for another month. And we will certainly go into those details together on the 29th of November. Bear with us for now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lance Vitanza from TD Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: My question is around how Vertiv is positioned specifically with respect to liquid cooling and direct-to-chip technologies. Are there notable gaps in your product portfolio? And if so, how do you expect to address them? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Hey, Lance, we feel very good about our liquid cooling portfolio. And it's a broad portfolio, and it's a portfolio that stretches direct-to-chip, immersion cooling, so we feel good with what we have today in the portfolio. And again... \nLance Vitanza: [indiscernible] \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes, go ahead. \nLance Vitanza: No, no, please continue. \nGiordano Albertazzi: No, I was saying that would be a big... \nLance Vitanza: My follow-up was just going -- yes. So just specifically, do you worry about potentially being disintermediated, so to speak, by either hyperscalers or chip manufacturers directly embedding their own or someone else's technology into the chip or into the rack and thus bypassing Vertiv? Is that something that you worry about? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We are working very closely with both hyperscalers and chip manufacturers. And the whole landscape of high-density cooling and power looks very promising to us. And again, more when we're together also in the interest of time. \nOperator: We currently have no further questions. So I would like to hand over back to Giordano for closing remarks. \nGiordano Albertazzi: All right. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So again, 2023, certainly shaping up as a strong year. We're happy about that. Again, an opportunity for me to thank the Vertiv team around the world for their hard work, dedication and focus. So we definitely have seen the benefits of a stronger execution. And we really appreciate your support. We look forward to connecting with all of you in November at our Investor Conference. With that, thank you very much, and have a splendid day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Gio. Turning in the presentation to Page 7. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. As you can see, strong financial performance continues across the board. Organic net sales up 17%, with 9% from volume and 8% from pricing. As Gio mentioned, we continue to see the Americas, which was up 40% organically, drive the growth engine, particularly in this past third quarter.\n Adjusted operating profit was $162 million higher than last year's third quarter, mainly driven by $100 million price cost benefit and $45 million of volume. Adjusted operating profit was $40-plus million higher than our prior guidance, driven by $15 million higher-than-anticipated pricing and $30 million lower inflation, as we have seen some core metals, notably steel, trending lower in the past quarter.\n We did have a onetime $7 million benefit from a commercial concession as we note on this slide that also contributed to the favorability versus prior guidance. This commercial concession also favorably influenced adjusted operating margin by 40 to 50 basis points as adjusted operating margin reached 17% in the quarter. And that's 790 basis point higher than last year, a great indicator of the significant progress we have made in a relatively short period in driving operational execution.\n Certainly more work to do, but third quarter results should provide some confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-term margin targets.\n Moving to the right on this slide. We had another strong quarter of adjusted free cash flow, generating $221 million in the quarter, a year-over-year improvement of $241 million. We continue to see the benefit of higher profitability and improved working capital management really across the organization. Cash taxes were higher, the inevitable result of driving higher profitability.\n But in general, we are driving much more consistency and predictability with our cash flow, controlling the things that matter, notably trade working capital, as we fully appreciate that sales and profitability mean little if they do not translate into cash flow, which is absolutely essential to drive long-term shareholder value.\n Last on this slide, if you look at the bottom right-hand corner, net leverage declined to 2.4x at the end of the quarter and is expected to be approximately 2.1x by year-end. Of course, this net leverage improvement certainly correlates with improved cash generation. Clearly, our balance sheet continues to strengthen, which provides flexibility as we think about capital deployment. And more to come on capital deployment in our November 29th Investor Conference.\n Next, turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. The Americas region continues its strong growth trajectory with organic net sales up 40%, including 28% from volume and 12% from pricing. We continue to see substantial year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin in the Americas, up 910 basis points, which is largely driven by favorable price cost and fixed cost leverage.\n APAC top line, moving to the center section of the graph, continues to be negatively impacted by China, with organic net sales in that region declining 7% from last year. From a subregion perspective, the rest of Asia, so everything outside of China continues to grow nicely year-over-year, up low double digits in the third quarter. Adjusted operating margin for APAC remained flat year-over-year despite the lower sales at 19.1%, really a strong testament to their focus on cost control while continuing to drive margin enhancements.\n Now we do anticipate that APAC will return to mid- to low single-digit year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, in part due to typical fourth quarter seasonality in China, but this region will likely be down for full year 2023 versus 2022. And we are not planning for a sharp recovery in China at the beginning of '24. Rather, we are expecting sales activity to be relatively muted, at least until the back half of next year.\n The EMEA region was relatively flat organically in the third quarter, which was slightly better than we anticipated in guidance. Flat year-over-year sales in the quarter was mostly due to timing, as we expect a significant sequential increase in the fourth quarter, with full year organic sales growth in that region in the upper single- to low double digits. EMEA continues to deliver strong adjusted operating margin, almost 28% this quarter, an increase of 1,030 basis points compared with last year's third quarter, with the improvement driven by favorable price/cost and good fixed cost control.\n And finally, on this page, corporate costs in the third quarter were approximately $7 million higher than last year, driven by both R&D investment and an incremental $3 million foreign exchange loss. Our current guidance assumes second half corporate costs in the aggregate to be consistent with the first half.\n Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We expect a strong finish to the year with adjusted operating profit in the range of $295 million to $305 million and adjusted operating margin at 16.3% at the midpoint, 360 basis points higher than last year's fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be down sequentially from the 17% in the third quarter as regional mix plays a role with higher APAC volume. And recall that the third quarter was favorably impacted by the commercial concession that we talked about a couple of slides ago.\n Adjusted free cash flow is also projected to be lower sequentially as we expect CapEx to ramp up about $35 million, a lot of that driven by timing. And working capital use should be approximately $35 million higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter as sales are expected to increase about $100 million sequentially.\n China cash collections are a watch item for the fourth quarter, with larger customers paying a bit slower given the macro environment there and the impact on cash availability.\n Next, moving to Slide 10, our full year guidance. We are increasing projected full year sales by approximately $30 million and adjusted operating profit to $1.20 billion to $1.30 billion, an increase of over $580 million from 2022. This revised guidance is approximately $75 million higher than previous guidance, with $40 million from the third quarter beat and $35 million from the raise in the fourth quarter.\n Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to be 15%, 730 basis points higher than last year, with approximately 500 basis points from higher variable contribution margin and over 200 basis points from fixed cost leverage. And finally, on this page, we are increasing adjusted free cash flow guidance by $75 million to $625 million at the midpoint, $885 million higher than last year. This improvement demonstrates our focus on cash and the operational process improvements that have taken a hold across the organization. And our commitment to delivering strong and consistent free cash flow is a crucial part of our high-performance culture, and I believe this could be a harbinger of continued good things to come.\n And with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. Yes. And Nigel, on your question on pricing carryover, unfortunately, probably a little premature to give specific numbers that there certainly will be some benefit. It probably is not reasonable to anticipate 8% pricing every year going forward like we've seen this year and even the 7% last year. But we do anticipate to have some carryover impact. And the one thing we can safely say, it's certainly our intention going forward, even beyond, to be price/cost positive."

            "name": "Giordano Albertazzi",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Dave. In the last 12 months, we have created intense focus on operational execution, including margin improvement and cash flow generation, combined with a sense of urgency, which underpins a high-performance culture. This quarter shows progress across the board, exceeding our own expectations, demonstrating there is still more value the business can deliver.\n Here are some highlights. Third quarter sales were up 17% organically. Americas continues to lead the growth, up 40%. We continue to see headwinds in APAC, specifically in China. More on that in a few slides.\n Very pleased with our orders, up 11%, excluding FX. We were not totally surprised by the strength in orders. We have seen pipelines built, but timing is never certain. We are encouraged by the order booking acceleration. We believe this is a sign of good things to come.\n Adjusted operating profit, that was $296 million, and adjusted operating margin of 17%. Operational execution is sharpening and certainly translating into margin performance. We had another strong cash flow quarter, an area of intense focus, and we are delivering. Of course, this has a nice effect on our leverage, which was 2.4 at the end of September, and guidance gets us close to 2x by year-end.\n Given our performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year guidance. Again, we're now expecting sales for the full year to be up 21% organically, AOP between $1,020 million and $1,030 million and adjusted free cash flow of $625 million at the midpoint. A very strong year continues to unfold, and we see that momentum enduring.\n Let's turn to Slide 4. No changes on the market environment slide. Things are consistent with the picture we gave 90 days ago, healthy markets overall. The data center end market remains strong, with the cloud hyperscale and colocation continued to lead the growth. We see accelerating demand and a strong overall market for the foreseeable future.\n Different customers are at different points in their demand cycle, but they all recognize that strong future demand is coming. There are encouraging signs from enterprise. We are hearing a more positive outlook, but still balanced against some macro concerns. Telecom is still weak. Some telco carriers have delayed investments, and there is a lull in the market after a few years of a strong 5G investment.\n Regionally, APAC remains soft, mainly due to a slow Chinese market, partially offset by encouraging signs in India and rest of Asia. We don't anticipate a sharp recovery in China and expect that it will stay soft until the back end of 2024. Now the bright spot in APAC, India, is quite convincing. A lot of investment happening, and the trend is likely to continue for quite a while.\n We are also seeing good activity in Malaysia, the Philippines and Southeast Asia in general. I continue to be quite encouraged by the market signals. We are seeing the demand formation in the pipeline, in the order book, in conversations with customers all over the world.\n There's a very good seg to Slide 5. Let's go to Slide 5, please. Orders in Q3 were up 11% year-on-year and 16% sequentially. I have said throughout the year that pipeline activity is strong. We are seeing that translate into orders. So not entirely surprising, but encouraging velocity. We anticipate Q4 orders will also be positive year-on-year. I wouldn't be surprised if Q4 growth was like Q3's, velocity is increasing.\n Now we get a lot of questions on the amount of AI activity in our order book. Those questions are often formulated as binary questions. Is it AI? Or is it not AI? But there is no binary answer. If we talk about technologies that univocally are applied to high-density GPU or compute, as for example, liquid cooling, CDUs or some rack-level power distribution solutions, I will still say our order book is in the tens of millions of dollars. But many elements of our portfolio, chillers, direct expansion cooling, heat rejection systems, switchgear, busbars, UPS, you name them are -- regardless if GPU or CPU compute, high density or normal density. So the volume supporting AI or future AI-proof data centers is way larger than that tens of millions.\n Also, many data centers have been designed to be multipurpose. So the majority of our products will support many types of compute, including AI. That is the beauty of having a comprehensive portfolio of all critical infrastructure technologies across the entire span of the powertrain, the thermal chain and IT-wide space infrastructure, something that very few companies truly have.\n Different players, hyperscale, colocation but also enterprise and edge will have different approaches to AI. And now that suits us well. Complexity, customization at scale, all things we're good at. So overall, AI is coming, and we anticipate it will show up. We're in a more pronounced manner in 2024.\n Now on to supply chain. We are in a much different place than we were historically, much different. I'm not just talking about incrementally better than 90 days ago. If you look at the progress over the last year, you tangibly see this in our reduced lead times. Suppliers of key components have been making substantial capacity investments, and we are seeing the benefit. We have qualified many additional suppliers, with a sharp eye on geopolitical diversification and overall supply chain resilience. We are doing capacity locks in key areas to make sure the supply base is strong for today and for the future under various growth scenarios. We will be ready.\n Let's move to Slide 6. Here, we want to provide some additional color around capacity, an important topic given the different growth scenarios that are indeed possible. We start in a strong place, with 22 manufacturing plants around the world. It's much more believable to say you can scale with this strong starting point. The existing footprint was built with the idea that future growth would need to be accommodated. So you've seen us scale, expand existing facilities, ramp-up the 2 facilities -- the 2 new facilities to support growth.\n And we have buffer capacity in our plants today, roughly around additional 25% to support more intense growth periods and can flex across facilities to optimize our production. And of course, we continue to invest.\n Productivity is another capacity lever. The utilization and productivity opportunities are plentiful. And candidly, just starting. Vertiv's operating system is being deployed vigorously across the organization, unlocking further capacity. I enjoyed tremendously running a plant during my early years with the company. So there is a manufacturing in general is near and dear to my heart. It has my and [ there's ] a full attention.\n We'll continue to make capital investments to support growth. We will be ready for what is ahead, but this can be done in a measured way that does not significantly change the cash flow profile of this business. We can invest for growth, prudently and deliver strong free cash flow. And with that, over to you, David. Well, thank you, David. Thanks a lot. And let's go to Slide 11.\n So some initial thoughts on 2024. I'm going to say we see more tailwinds than headwinds. Our starting point, it is a strong. The data center market continues to accelerate. And AI is forming a tailwind that will likely be more evident in 2024.\n Our supply chain resilience is at a much greater level of maturity. This is important as we think about the demand profiles that may emerge for next year and beyond. Balanced investments in the business will continue. R&D capacity, things that will support the growth of the business for the years to come. We will continue our relentless focus on operational execution and implement the Vertiv operating system increasingly deeply. This will support continuous improvement consistently. We have started making progress, but much more to come.\n There are headwinds too. Certainly, China is slow, and recovery doesn't appear near term. Worth noting, we anticipate more normal seasonality returning in 2024. And for Vertiv, that typically means our financial measures in absolute dollars get stronger sequentially as the year progresses.\n Let's go to Slide 12. Once more, remind everyone that we have our first Investor Conference on the 29th of November. So here are the topics we plan to cover that day. And we'll be sharing a lot of exciting information. I look forward to spending the day with you, talking about our strategy, technology, use on the market, operations and financial framework. We hope you will be able to join us, preferably in person, or remote.\n Let's go to Slide 13. I'd say we have meaningfully evolved from where we were a year ago. You can see that across all the key takeaways on this slide. A lot of improvement. It has been quite intense and fun, and we are still quite far from our full potential. I want to thank our team around the world for the passion and the hard work, tackling challenges every day, making sure we exceed our customer expectations, helping the entire industry scale and holding ourselves accountable for delivering strong results every quarter. I am sure you can see the early signs of a high-performing culture.\n With that, over to the operator. Over to you, Bruno. Yes. No, Scott. I would say, Telecom is neutral right now in this whole picture. Honestly speaking, the fact that telecom is soft is no new news this quarter. That's something that we already signaled for at least the last 2 calls.\n So we see that continuing in 2024. So if anything, we can be surprised by the opposite. In the industry, there is some expectations that sooner or later, the extreme edge will happen in the, let's say, telecom perimeter operations. But again, not counting on that, but having the right technology available and the customer reach, if that happens. Yes, Scott. Certainly, value is a big element. The industry and the line technology is becoming more complex. We will talk certainly about high density. We'll talk about the overall net increment on installed power and the need for total cost of ownership, efficiency, et cetera.\n So the world is becoming more complex. Value in terms of the technology that you deliver matters. And we talked about Vertiv's ability to exercise the pricing muscle, both in terms of process and in terms of translating value in the initial price, both in terms of project price process and in general, pricing new technology.\n But it's also true that the industry -- in the industry in general, there is more demand than capacity. So that is certainly a favorable environment in many respects. I'm going to say that we see in the future, diminishing price gains. We have certainly enjoyed a lot of the kind of catching up after the inflation. But again, we continue to be positive about the future investor respect. Looking forward. Nicole, as we -- as I mentioned, let me elaborate on it. As I mentioned, we are going more towards a normal is what is historically normal first half, second half. 2023 may expect a little bit abnormal in the sense that we had a pent-up backlog, let me say, almost a 2022 backlog residue that we moved because of the shortage of components, et cetera, moved to the first half of the year. So that makes certainly a more flat H1, H2 year.\n In this moment, we are thinking something that probably will be around 45%, 55% top line, first half, second half. Give and take something, it's too early to say, but that's probably the thought -- that thought process. I would be surprised, and it's again, early, but I would be surprised if H1 '24 were below 2023. So we -- I think it was going to be positive all the way through.\n But again, we'd like to be clear about the seasonality. That's all. There will be some CapEx growth, as a matter of fact, just as our top line grows. I mean, there will be an element of a proportionality, but probably a little bit more than that. Again, I think this is a unique trend in the industry, the main industry that we serve. And as we said, we have many ways to make sure that we make the capacity available.\n Productivity being one, we're making sure that we use everything that we have created in terms of capacity over the last couple of years. But yes, we -- if the conditions, as we believe, will favor that, we think we can be a little bit more aggressive. But I want to once more highlight the fact that we do not believe that this will materially, meaningfully change the cash flow profile of the business overall. Okay. So I would say that there is a lot of volume in the orders that we've taken. As I'm saying, we are -- as we are saying, we are -- we're printing nice price numbers this year in our sales. We expect that to trim a little bit. And the growth -- the future growth will have a very good volume component.\n When it comes to the duration, I think you're asking duration in terms of how far out the orders that we are receiving and covering. And I would say it's a little bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, there are shortened lead times, that I mentioned in a few occasions and also earlier today, are favorable in terms of accelerating what is the so-called run rate more territory business, which is always good, great also in terms of installed base creation for future service revenue. But we see also increasingly the big part of the -- the big players, be them hyperscalers or be them the large colocation players increasingly look out in terms of coverage. So it's really a good combination of the 2. Well, it's an absolutely good point that -- it's a very important part of our portfolio as well as a thermal part and one that will benefit from the expansion, the acceleration, the gigawatts that you are mentioning. Fundamentally, the powertrain that we have, from medium voltage switchgear all the way to busbars and PDUs, so the entire powertrain, it's not going to change dramatic. It's just going to be more, deployed more because it's more power that needs to be transferred from the grid to the chip.\n So it's good news. It's a net volume increase. There will be some fine-tuning in what exactly happens in terms of power distribution inside the rack. Some PDU solutions will be designed for high density, but it's a relatively small portion of the total powertrain that will expand as a lot.\n The other aspect is positive for the power side of our business is that power is, as we said several times that the industry is very vocal about that, an overall constraint, power availability for new data centers. And that drives operators to think about alternative ways to power. So dynamic power solution, microgrids, battery, energy storage systems, et cetera, are all future opportunities that we are keenly looking into and for which we are cooperating with the big players in terms of proof of concepts, et cetera. Something -- a future good opportunity for us. Well, I think it's a little bit premature to -- no, absolutely. To be exactly [ tail on ] -- even geographics within APAC. But again, we are very encouraged from what we see in India and Southeast Asia. China, again, we, of course, continue to be a strong player in China, a strong local player in China. But we have kind of a prudent posture in the way we look at the next year.\n When it comes to EMEA, I am encouraged by the pipeline. I'm very encouraged by pipelines in EMEA and also the conversations with the various customers. And you do say that the macroeconomics are not phenomenal in EMEA. And the geopolitics are as hard as it gets. There is clearly a big question mark when it comes to the Middle East, for us, not a big part of our market. Absolutely not a big part of our, let's say, our revenue. But yes, it's -- we don't know what will happen. But overall, for what we can control, absolutely a strong position in EMEA and good pipelines. So Nigel, I'll start with the general comments about the market. I mean, we will live in a commercially active world. Don't get me wrong. So different geographies, especially different types of market, different go-to markets have slightly different dynamics from a price standpoint. But overall, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to have a commercial advantage. Retrofit will be an opportunity, definitely. In this moment, we predominantly but not exclusively see new build. But there is also quite encouraging conversations about retrofit. But it's -- things are very much in flux. Things are very much in flux. We participate in both conversations very actively. Yes. No, absolutely. I would say that the general plus-25% that we were signaling during the slide show earlier, it's definitely applicable -- is definitely applicable to pretty much homogeneously across the world. And certainly true for the North American business as of now.\n And as I was saying, we will continue to invest. But we do have a very explicit and well-orchestrated initiative to make sure that we use and leverage the global capacity also for the U.S. It's something that we are doing already partially today in different degrees, different lines of business. But it's something that we will be able to accelerate and accentuate as we go ahead.\n In terms of American codes versus other type of codes, that's something that -- it's just about having the right certification of a plant outside the North American or American region. And it's something that we have or that we are accelerating, depending on the technology. So it's very, very margin-focused and very much something we do and that we will accelerate going forward. The second -- the last part of your question, we believe this is a long-term trend. In a sense that we believe that AI will be pretty pervasive. And this is just the beginning. This is a multiyear, truly many years of cycle -- many years cycle, we believe. Yes, definitely, colocation and hyperscale are a very large part of our mix and our order intake. And growing actually in terms of speed of growth. So well -- very well covered there.\n What we see is that the acceleration in compute power and anyway, utilization, and volume of data that is further accentuated by AI is going to require some infrastructure also on the enterprise side of the equation. More distributed compute, more edge compute or sometimes even on-prem or proprietary data centers. So clearly, the biggest part of the acceleration is coming, and it will come from the hyperscale, colo and cloud. But we are optimistic and positive about the Enterprise business.\n Plus, the Enterprise business constitute a big portion of what I was referring to, our more distributed territory go-to-market and type of segment. And we are helped by improving lead times. We are accelerating that part of the market. Yes. Well, we see China as really a general market situation. More so than anything to do with the export restrictions, in our case. I just want to remind everyone that no data flow through our stuff. The only thing we power and cool IT infrastructure. So clearly, the market is not strong in China right now. And we participate to the market as a very local supplier, as a very local player. The majority of our supply chain is local. So we operate as a Chinese supplier, and we move with that market. And that market in this moment is not strong. Well, again, there is a number of actions that we have implemented from a pricing standpoint. But clearly, the mix, the sequence of orders that we execute and a certain degree of being on the safe side and in guiding have all contributed to this price/cost upside. No, just when we're sharing the slide -- going through the slides, we have -- we expect a fourth quarter that is probably going to be up more or less the same that we think something around what we experienced in Q3. So we're quite optimistic about that.\n I would say that we should not read too much in the first half, second half. That's the normal nature of the industry. And again, it would have been the same of '23 first half, were it not for the supply constraints that marred the entire 2022 for us and for everyone else.\n So that, if anything, there was an artificial drift of backlog from, let's say, the second half of '22 to the first half of '23, that balanced the 2 halves in '23 in a way that is not so kind of normal in our type of business. So I would not read too much into it.\n We are happy about our pipeline. We're happy about the order pace. And yes, a lot of those orders will be coming from hyperscale and colo and that type of market. And really, those orders are placed today for tomorrow. Those are aligned with the big site deployments, with fairly forward-looking project plans. So I look at it as something quite normal, starting to happen again. Well, we are very happy by the way things are progressing in terms of portfolio, in terms of partnerships, et cetera. And yes, as I said in several occasions, we see that as -- we see this piece as additive because it's adding a link to the cooling chain, so to speak, to the thermal chain. We'll certainly have more details at Investor Day here, but pretty -- feel pretty good about what we're doing also with our partners and the biggest chip manufacturers. Yes. Service is accelerating for us towards a double-digit growth territory, which, of course, we like. It is in the nature of service, especially the life cycle part of service. I always like to think in terms of project services, the services that you sell with new equipment, say, and instead the life cycle, the duration of the life of the kit. The latter is very important from a profit standpoint, from a customer experience standpoint, but also very important because it compounds over time. But it's built on the installed base that we are growing.\n So we are happy about the direction. We want to accelerate further, and we'll accelerate further. But definitely, a component of service that is being able and uniquely, given our global footprint and experience, uniquely able to accompany our customers in the complexity from an installation commissioning start-up standpoint or retrofit standpoint, customer on the journey of high density, be it cooling high density, very complex. And power high density is something that, a, we are well equipped for, uniquely experienced and geographically positioned, but also getting ready for it. So I am -- I've never been more excited about our service opportunity going forward. I would say that there's certainly a very relevant question. And our Investor Day is relative -- is relatively soon about a month. And I think the best thing is to just ask you to be patient for us -- with us for another month. And we will certainly go into those details together on the 29th of November. Bear with us for now. Hey, Lance, we feel very good about our liquid cooling portfolio. And it's a broad portfolio, and it's a portfolio that stretches direct-to-chip, immersion cooling, so we feel good with what we have today in the portfolio. And again... Yes, go ahead. No, I was saying that would be a big... We are working very closely with both hyperscalers and chip manufacturers. And the whole landscape of high-density cooling and power looks very promising to us. And again, more when we're together also in the interest of time. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So again, 2023, certainly shaping up as a strong year. We're happy about that. Again, an opportunity for me to thank the Vertiv team around the world for their hard work, dedication and focus. So we definitely have seen the benefits of a stronger execution. And we really appreciate your support. We look forward to connecting with all of you in November at our Investor Conference. With that, thank you very much, and have a splendid day."

Well, we've delivered another strong quarter, built squarely on getting the fundamentals right, good operational execution throughout the organization that translated nicely, outperforming guidance in the third quarter. I believe we're starting to see a trend and one we plan to continue.\n Financial and operating performance continues to strengthen significantly across the board. And the most exciting part of that is we're still early in our path of improvement. Alignment to great end market matters. We have a great position in a good industry, and our technology differentiation continues to strengthen. Data continues to proliferate in good times and bad times. And that portends a very favorable end market environment for the foreseeable future.\n We're intending to finish the year strong. The benefits of our [ seed ] planning are taking hold and still to be fully realized. Our end markets remain resilient.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Lauren. Good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer; Giordano Albertazzi; and Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon.\n Before we begin, I would like to point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings made with the SEC.\n Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n During this call, we will also present rapid non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Well, these last few quarters have been a lot more enjoyable to report. We had another strong quarter of performance in Vertiv, which positions us very well to achieve our significantly increased 2023 outlook. Adjusted free cash flow, adjusted operating profit, sales and margins all performed very well and operational execution continues to improve. We've raised our full year guidance because of our strong first half performance. We also have the very pleasant effect of a strengthening balance sheet. The data center end market continues to look very healthy, and there is an incremental tailwind from AI coming. And that tailwind should provide additional opportunities over many years for Vertiv because our technology will matter. A great market position, a great industry where we can differentiate with technology, these attributes are what attracted me to Vertiv over 4 years ago, and they are truer today than ever. \n We're obviously pleased with the results, but there is so much more to come. There's a lot of upside, not just in the market and our technology, but also just continuing to fix legacy process issues and building a high-performance culture which didn't exist. Gio and his team are off to a great start, and there is a lot of work left to be done, but it is also [indiscernible] supports more consistent execution over the long term.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you very much, Dave. We saw the positive momentum continuing into second quarter across all key financial metrics. Second quarter sales were up 25% organically, led again by a 48% increase in Americas. We continue to see supply chain improvements and increased resiliency. We saw healthy market demand, which supported the shipment of substantial volume in the Americas region. Orders excluding FX, were down just 3% from last year's second quarter better than anticipated, and book-to-bill remained at 1. Despite ongoing order normalization as well as difficult comparison, the market remains healthy. We have also seen an encouraging AI-related activity, and I'll elaborate on this when we cover Slide 6. \n Our adjusted operating profit was $251 million, and we saw benefits from our increased volume as well as price cost. Our adjusted operating profit margin improved 860 basis points to 14.5% as we continue to strengthen operational execution. I am particularly pleased to report the strong adjusted free cash flow of $227 million in second quarter. We also continue to see the leverage profile of the business to improve at 3.1x at the end of Q2 as the balance sheet continues to strengthen. These are early successes and still much more opportunity ahead. We are raising fairly significantly our full year guidance. And are now expecting sales for the full year to be up 20% organically, AOP at $950 million at the midpoint and adjusted free cash flow of $550 million at the midpoint. We are executing our plan to deliver the full year 1 quarter at a time, and our transformation continues. \n We are making meaningful steps forward in our operational execution. We are demonstrating clear traction and there is tremendous value creation ahead. We're not relenting our focus on operational execution, that is what we intend to continue to demonstrate each and every quarter. \n So let's now turn to Page 4. A few changes on the market environment slide. First, we moved cloud hyperscale to green in EMEA. Globally, we have seen an acceleration in the cloud hyperscale and colocation market segment in the last 90 days, substantiated by the large amount of incremental capacity that is being planned as well as by the amount of leasing capacity that was signed in the -- in this past quarter gigawatts of new capacity.\n Our pipelines have clearly strengthened. It is hard to delineate what is AI and what is not. But we know the industry is certainly getting ready for AI, and we have orders in our books and opportunities in our pipeline that are unequivocally for AI infrastructure. \n Conversations with cloud and colo players are now around making sure there is available capacity to support a healthy outlook, and we are in discussions with several large and relevant customers on what this commercial arrangement can look like, very encouraging. \n As we move to telecom, this area has further weakened in the last 90 days, with some further carving of spent by the major telco carriers. We anticipate the telecom markets remain quiet for the balance of 2023, not particularly worrisome. These patterns are not atypical for this market. We have left the APAC market yellow across the segments. The China market specifically, experienced a slower-than-expected start to the year, not just for us but for most companies. In our current view, we are not anticipating much recovery in China market in 2023, but there are some encouraging signs as we see orders turned positive in Q2 and pipelines are healthy. No changes in view on enterprise SMB or commercial and industrial. Overall, I'm more encouraged today than 90 days ago, given clear demand signals from the cloud hyperscale colocation markets that support our view for second half '23 and shape our thinking around 2024.\n Let's move to Slide 5. Orders performed better than anticipated, although down 3%, they are coming together stronger than expected, and they were 13% sequentially up from Q1. Book-to-bill ratio of 1 preserves a healthy backlog. We anticipate orders flat more or less in Q3 and turning positive in Q4. \n I know everyone is interested in what AI orders looks -- looked like in the quarter. And candidly, that would be almost impossible to answer with precision. We have seen AI-related orders, I would say, in the tens of millions of dollars. Our customers are focused on AI retrofit rate infrastructure, and we see evidence of this in our pipelines. Many of our products today can be used for either regular density or high-density applications, and we won't be able to report out a discrete AI number. For example, most AI viewed today are still being air cooled, perfectly served by the traditional vertical portfolio. Over time, a part of these loads will transition to liquid. And here too, we are uniquely positioned, liquid to remove heat from the server and the rack, but removal of the heat doesn't stop outside the rack. You need to remove the heat from the data hole, and we have a portfolio of solutions to do just that.\n As I say, we are seeing clear demand acceleration signals from the market, and we are having conversations with very relevant market players, around securing capacity and not just over the next few quarters, but well in '24 and beyond. \n Let us transition to supply chain. We see improving the environment but there are 2 parts to this story. First, supply chain continues to incrementally improve. No doubt, lead times are gradually reducing, and there is more certainty supply. The second part is the self-health part. We have been vocal about our multi-sourcing programs. One of the most important architects of this ongoing supply chain resilience program, Paul Ryan, is now our leader of global procurement. He is not new to me or Vertiv. He has been with us over a decade and has more than 25 years of experience and a strong track record operational execution combined with very clear strategic vision. Supply chain resilience is key considering the demand waves that may be ahead. \n Let's now talk capacity. We have been investing in capacity for a few years in a balanced approach across the globe. [indiscernible] The focus is on utilizing and coordinating capacity globally. We have recently announced a new role in the organization, Executive Vice President, Manufacturing, Logistics and Operational Excellence with Andrew's -- [ Anders Carberry ] leading the effort. Over the last 5 years, [ Anders ] led Vertiv's operations in Asia, then EMEA and finally, Americas. In the Americas operations over the past year, specifically, we have seen significant improvements. He's the right person to take the organization to the next level on process and operations improvement as well as company-wide deployment of Vertiv operating system. Our ability to navigate strong periods of growth in a complex environment continues to improve. \n Let's talk about inflation. While inflation is trending a bit more favorably than anticipated, a couple of dynamics influence the second half of 2023. First, metal prices were at lower levels in Q3 and Q4 over the last year. So as we lap that comparison, we're experiencing year-on-year inflation, a bitter higher, a bit higher in the second half. We also anticipate when the Chinese economy accelerates, that increased demand could cause additional inflationary pressure on commodities. We have seen a favorable tailwind from price cost with good processes in place that better prepare us for volatility related to our input costs. \n Let's go to Slide 6. We believe AI will increase our overall TAM. AI is a reinforcement of demand trend and AI workloads are incremental to new applications. They aren't in general, replacing other applications in our digital economy. We expect growth in both high-density and general compute. This benefits all Vertiv technologies. We believe liquid cooling is not a displacement risk and, in fact, is additive to growth for Vertiv. Before liquid cooling, we would take the heat from it outside the rack to outside the data center building. With liquid cooling, it's additive. We reach out into the rack and get one step closer to the heat generation point while still controlling all parts of the heat rejection.\n The infrastructure transition to AI, high-density environment will be complicated and likely involve hybrid approaches to technology deployment. It is very likely a data center will need both liquid and air cooling orchestrated tightly together to optimize the data center environment. We do very well with that approach with the widest portfolio of thermal technology available, deepest domain expertise on how to orchestrate these technologies using our advanced control systems. \n Hence over 3,500 field service engineers across the world to support the deployment and maintenance of the infrastructure. We have the scale and the ability to increase capacity. And I hope -- and I believe you can sense my excitement. Much more to come on high-density AI at our Investor conference in November, but feel very well positioned for this opportunity. \n With that, over to Dave. \nDavid Fallon: Perfect. Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results. As you can see, strong financial performance across the board, starting with our [indiscernible] from last year. 9% of that was from pricing and 16% from volume, with most of that volume benefit in the Americas, highlighting the continued supply chain and operational improvements in that region, which has been a pillar of our turnaround over the last 18 months or so. Adjusted operating profit of [indiscernible] quarter and adjusted operating margin of 14.5% improved 860 basis points, of which 610 was from higher variable contribution margin and 250 basis points was from fixed cost leverage. \n Adjusted operating profit was $61 million higher than our prior guidance, $45 million from higher pricing, $25 million from incremental volume and $15 million from lower-than-expected inflation with these tailwinds, partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange and investment in fixed costs, primarily from restructuring and incentive compensation. Higher-than-expected pricing was driven by higher volume, favorable regional mix and some conservatism for potential pricing headwinds that did not materialize. Inflation was not as bad as we expected as commodity costs, including metals, declined from the end of the first quarter, likely influenced by a slower-than-expected rebound in the Chinese economy. \n Next, on this slide, and very proudly, we generated $227 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, an impressive $460 million higher than last year's second quarter. While there's still a lot of work to do to optimize working capital, our second quarter is reflective of our focus on cash and indicative of the cash generation potential of this business when we do control working capital, which increased just $5 million in the second quarter despite a $213 million increase in sales from the first quarter. \n Now the second quarter number was aided by some favorable timing tailwinds, and we should not expect free cash flow to be 130% of adjusted net income each quarter, but it shows we have made significant strides towards unlocking the cash generation potential of this business while funding organic growth. \n Last on this slide, net leverage declined to 3.1x at the end of the quarter and is expected to be approximately 2.3x by year-end, well within our previously communicated target leverage range of 2 to 3x. It was only a few months ago that we were being labeled by some and likely discounted from a multiple perspective as highly levered. We argued at the time that it was pursuant to a mechanical calculation and just a matter of timing. Well, I think we were proven correct as our year-to-date performance has now driven that mechanical calculation towards what we believe to be the practical reality. \n Turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to show strong year-over-year performance with organic net sales growth of $0.48 including 35% from volume and 13% from pricing. Adjusted operating margin improved 12.3 percentage points on the strength of price cost, fixed cost leverage and notably improved operating results from E&I.\n APAC top line continues to be influenced by slower-than-expected recovery in China. Volume was relatively flat, so our organic growth was driven by incremental pricing. Adjusted operating margin declined about 100 basis points from last year, and that was primarily driven by approximately $6 million of restructuring costs in the quarter. We do anticipate sequential quarterly sales growth in APAC in the third quarter but we have reduced our full year projection from our prior guidance, now expecting full year low single-digit growth. \n EMEA grew organically 9% in the second quarter almost entirely driven by pricing. We expect third quarter sale EMEA to be down slightly from the second quarter, with a significant increase in the fourth quarter and full year growth expected to be in the upper single digits. EMEA continues to impress from an adjusted operating margin perspective, posting 26.6% for the second quarter, 870 basis points higher than last year, with this increase primarily driven by price cost and fixed cost leverage.\n Finally, on this page, corporate costs were $21 million higher than last year, driven by higher restructuring and incentive compensation costs and an incremental $5 million loss on foreign exchange. Based on the current guidance, we anticipate these incremental costs at our corporate entity to flow through for the full year, and we expect second half corporate cost to be consistent with the first half. \n Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our third quarter guidance. As a reminder, we have anticipated a more stable quarterly sequential sales cadence as we proceed through 2023. For this reason, our third quarter guidance looks largely consistent with our second quarter in absolute terms. We have included provision for sequential increases in both pricing and inflation in the third quarter and sequential headwinds from foreign exchange, including $15 million on sales and $5 million on adjusted operating profit.\n Moving to Slide 10, our full year guidance. We are raising our projected top line by $285 million, primarily driven by higher expected sales in the Americas, partially offset by lower expected sales in APAC with EMEA consistent with prior guidance. We are raising our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance by $150 million, $60 million from the second quarter beat and $90 million in the second half. This increase translates into a 170 basis point increase in our expected adjusted operating margin to 14%. And while we have not explicitly provided fourth quarter guidance, math suggests we exit the year at 15%, edging closer to our intermediate-term target of 16%, which should provide good momentum transitioning into 2024. \n And finally, on this page, we are increasing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance by $200 million at the midpoint to $550 million. This is an $810 million improvement over last year and demonstrates momentum not only with our drive for profitability but also with our management of working capital. \n Before I hand it back over to Gio, let me front run some potential questions on our adjusted free cash flow guidance, which implies approximately $300 million of free cash flow in the second half, which is $150 million lower than our second quarter number multiplied by 2. The primary driver of this variance is timing, timing for both CapEx and cash taxes, which are normally back half loaded, and this year is no exception. These 2 items explain approximately $130 million of the $150 million variance. The remainder is driven by higher use of cash from trade working capital as we prepare for strong anticipated demand in 2024, and that being partially offset by higher projected EBITDA and lower cash interest.\n So with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thanks a lot. As Dave said earlier, great quarter. There's still a lot to do. In February -- in our February call, I went through the focus areas for 2023, creating a high-performance culture where ownership is clear, and we hold ourselves accountable for the results, constant focus on things that matter, and executing relentless focus on execution. At the halfway mark of 2023, we have made progress.\n Innovation and technology continue to be a key differentiator for Vertiv. And with our ongoing investment in this area, I'm very encouraged by our road maps for R&D and technology development. I believe you will see this momentum building and differentiation further distinguish Vertiv as the partner of choice in critical infrastructure. I continue to travel around the globe visiting customers in Vertiv locations, and key industry players are more excited today than I have been in the last 25 years with this great organization. I can feel the energy, the momentum building in our business, in our industry. It is tangible. This traction is not easy to translate in words, but you are starting to see the transformation taking hold, deepening and becoming Vertiv's DNA. \n So the takeaways. Strong first half, supported by continued improvements in operational execution, a healthy market, momentum continuing, in fact, increasing with AI tailwinds. We are raising our guidance across all financial metrics and especially pleased to be raising our adjusted operating profit guidance to $950 million at the midpoint. This indicates a healthy second half and a great foundation for 2024. \n An important reminder, Vertiv's Investors Conference on November 29th at the New York Stock Exchange. So I truly hope you can join us and make sure you mark that in your calendars. \n With that, over to the operator. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: So November conference is in the calendar. No problem with that. Great. So obviously, a lot to go through. One thing you mentioned, Gio, was the AI, so GPU retrofit opportunity. And we don't often think of retrofit activity in the data centers. So maybe just run through sort of what you're seeing today and sort of how impactful do you think this could be for Vertiv? And maybe just talk about how important your service organization can be if we do start seeing material retrofits? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes, 2 aspects to this, Nigel. Thank you for the question. There is certainly a kind of a non-retrofit new market, new data center, and it's a place, this one, where our service organization becomes absolutely critical in our ability to partner with customers everywhere in the world. Not all the players in specifically the liquid part of the thermal spectrum have this ability to reach out everywhere as we are. And we have demonstrated that, and our numbers prove that. As I was saying, 3,500 service engineers globally. \n But the other is we see it today and we talk with our customers today, and they say, not only do we have to think about liquid cooling. But the thing that we have to think about is a hybrid environment probably in an initial build that has more traditional server cooling. So there needs to be an ability to retrofit over time because the sites will hybridize and we enable that. And then being there with our customers to execute on that retrofit is again fundamental. And that retrofit is not just the rack itself or the row, but it's the ability to interconnect and balance it with the rest of the existing thermal system. \n But think about the stock of data center that exists in the industry today. It's really hard to believe that, that part will not be hybrid in and of itself. And that's what we hear. That's what we hear today. Today, we hear people saying, hey, we are already today sometimes having AI-enabling high-density racks, and we air cool them. But that sounds easier said than done, then you have to balance, of course, the cooling in the hole. But at the same time, that very same retrofit can be a liquid retrofit eventually. And again, the same problem exists. Even more complicated, if you will, than with an infrastructure that was thought for future retrofit. Hope I answered. It could be very long. I will avoid. \nNigel Coe: Yes. Yes, there's a lot there. I mean, it sounds like it could be quite a material opportunity. \nGiordano Albertazzi: We don't have exactly a figure on that. \nNigel Coe: Okay. No, no. We'll come back to that. On the pricing, so I think it's 9% in the quarter. I think, 7% in the third quarter. Maybe, David, what's in your fourth quarter for pricing? And then what would be a reasonable outlook for pricing in 2024? I'm assuming we're going to be down to a more sort of normal range. But I'm just curious if you're still continuing to push price real time. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. From a quarterly cadence perspective, pricing, 9% first quarter, 9% second quarter, 7% in the third quarter, and 5% in the fourth. So full year, $420 million, it's up about $120 million from our prior guidance, and it's probably too early at this point to comment on 2024 pricing. But we should have a nice tailwind heading into next year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with from Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Gio, you said it's difficult to discern AI versus not AI in your markets. But as you said, your pipeline of opportunities seems to have increased in the last 90 days, and you turned EMEA's cloud hyperscale to green. So is there a way to quantify how much bigger your pipeline is that is feeding into the expectation of flat bookings in Q3 and up modestly in Q4? And then just stepping back, would you say AI contribution in orders is coming earlier than you expected in 2023? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, the acceleration of pipeline that I referred to in my -- when we were going through the slide is specific to industry -- sorry, to region and customer, really. So it varies, but acceleration it is. How big? It is, again, part of a wave of demand, as I explained. This is additional demand, and it is additional demand that will probably drive also the more traditional type of loads and compute further up. Specifically, the comment about EMEA is that we start to see this effect hit EMEA as well. And anyway, we wanted to send the message that we see acceleration on colo cloud across the board because of AI. How big, exactly? Again, it's premature to say. The market is moving. I would say it's hard to distinguish what is AI and what is not, but we know that some technologies, specifically for high-density, specifically for GPU. And that is a little bit earlier to track. But we know that there are a lot of traditional technologies, a lot of traditional technologies that are there to enable AI as well. And that's true for the power part of our portfolio and for the thermal part of our portfolio. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: Congrats on a nice print. Gio, I was hoping you could just talk a little bit more about when it comes to cooling AI clusters, liquid cooling clearly becomes a more important thing, especially in higher densities. But there seems to be multiple ways that you can use liquid cooling. Direct-to-chip is something you folks do, but I think there's immersion and other forms of it. So from your perspective, do you think Vertiv's strategy would be to have a broader liquid cooling solution across different formats? Or would you want to focus more on direct-to-chip? And then as it comes -- as it relates to these AI clusters, can you just touch on what do you think your economics look like versus the corporate average? \nGiordano Albertazzi: So I want to reiterate the message that I had when I was going through the slides is that when we talk about liquid cooling here, we really talk about how we extract heat from the heat generation point, i.e., the chip to outside the server outside the rack and into the data hole, this is the novelty. This is the new part. As I was saying, actually, there are 3 ways to make that extraction. A, continue to do it through air. And we have seen air-cooled racks going all the way to north of 40 kilowatts per rack density. But clearly, at a certain stage, as one of our slides was explaining, at a certain stage, liquid kicks in. Liquid kicks in, in form of immersion or direct-to-chip. We have both in our portfolio. And also, we're partnering with people that handle both. But the fact is we think -- we believe that the main technology going forward when it comes to liquid is really direct-to-chip. But again, it is certainly a portfolio approach that we're taking. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then, I guess, how do you think about the economics with these clusters versus corporate average? I imagine it's more complex with higher ASPs. But I would love to know if you think that, A, that's fair, and then how does it flow out for operating margins and so on as well? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, it's a bit a lot of detail and also, premature for those details. But I go back to the point I made at the beginning, we see this as additive. So it is another technology. We did not participate in the heat sink or extraction of the heat from the server. Now we started to participate also in that part of the equation. So a bit premature, but I want to make sure we understand that is something, an addition for us. But that absolutely dovetails in what you're asking for. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Lance Vitanza with TD Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: My question is with leverage down to around 2x at the end of the year, you're about a year ahead of where we thought you'd be. And it seems to me that 2x is low enough and that free cash flow in 2024 should be directed back to shareholders. Can you discuss your thoughts on that idea? And would you favor increasing the recurring dividend or a share buyback or perhaps other vehicles? How are you thinking about the return of capital? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. First, let me say, it's very nice to have this conversation because we couldn't have asked this a year ago. So at this point, we're going to get through this year. And we will share in our investor conference our further thoughts on capital allocation. We certainly are participating in an industry where there should be plenty of growth, and there's probably plenty of opportunity to continue to reinvest in the business. But we do recognize that we will have to make some strategic decisions with what to do with some excess cash. I think as we said previously, we do believe there are some accretive strategic acquisitions out there. That is probably something we would look at first, but we'll be able to give a lot more detail in November. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. \nJeffrey Sprague: Nice quarter. Good to see. I wanted to pick up on sort of the exit rate there on the margin. And David, thanks for doing that math for us. We had done it, but I'm glad you pointed it out. And really, the -- I guess, the question is if we go back to that original algorithm before kind of the missteps to 18.5 months ago -- 18 months ago or so, we were thinking about operational improvement, being better on price execution, the internal execution and the like. I just wonder if you could update us on all of those levers really, particularly kind of the internal operational opportunities that you see. And I would suspect we're in a strong enough demand environment that you would expect to be able to remain price cost positive for the foreseeable future, but I wonder if you would agree with that. Or how are you thinking about kind of the price cost lever inside the margin trajectory from here? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Maybe I can start with a little bit of the 3 points you were talking and were asking about: price, cost and execution. I mean this is something we've been absolutely vocal about in the last 3 calls, as a matter of fact, this included. There's certainly a lot of price efforts and successful execution, as David explained also, our outlook. But what is most important is our price cost. When we were talking about price, I was vocal about the fact that we have now a muscle that we did not have before, and that has helped a lot to rebalance back to the position, let's say, pretty big inflation position. .\n When it comes to the cost side of the equation, we have a lot of focus on efficiency, be that in manufacturing execution, be that in procurement. And there is still potential -- there's still potential in general. Execution, in particular, is true across the organization. But I can point particularly to the execution that we have started to drive in the procurement and manufacturing and ability to ship. That has certainly characterized and accelerated our ability to deliver on a strong backlog we enter 2023 with. \n So we will have time in November to go to more details of exactly what are the axis of this acceleration. But I was vocal about our internal promotion of Paul and [ Anders ] as a further step in the direction that is testament to the fact that we are not done yet. And that's very good news. I don't know if you... \nJeffrey Sprague: Yes. No, it is. I wonder if you could maybe give us some perspective on incremental margins, so trying to kind of pull all that together. So we kind of say we're not done in '23, but we've kind of pulled out of the big hole and/or something maybe approaching normal, not quite there. But as we look into 2024 and beyond, what would be kind of a reasonable kind of incremental margin construct for us to have in our head? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I think the easy answer is higher. But if you look at where we were last year -- and we've disclosed this in the past. We were probably in the low 30s from a variable contribution margin perspective. We're in the upper 30s at this point in time. Let's call it the mid- to upper 30s. So if you look at the projected 600-plus basis point increase in operating margin this year versus last year, about 400 of that is related to the variable contribution margin and 200 is related to fixed cost leverage. And I definitely don't want to discount the power of the fixed cost constant methodology and culture. That should continue to provide upward momentum on the operating profit. So as we've consistently said, 16% has been our intermediate-term goal. We have high confidence of getting there for sure, but we're not celebrating. Our long-term goal is 20% and higher. But to get to that level, Jeff, to your question, we're going to have to continue to improve with the contribution margin while also incorporating that fixed cost leverage philosophy. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: Can we just start with enterprise demand? I know you didn't change the bubbles in the market outlook, but what are you seeing on that front? I know this has been kind of like a watched item year-to-date. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Nicole, not much really to add to what we were saying. We continue to see that demand fairly, fairly stable. The technology continues to be evolving for everyone in the industry, and that's not just colo hyperscale. But again, not a lot to elaborate upon here. We see -- we've seen some stability in that space. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. And then the EMEA margins, obviously, pretty big step-up this quarter. How are you guys thinking about the sustainability of that level of margins into the second half of the year? \nGiordano Albertazzi: I would say that we have done a very, very good job operationally in terms of positioning ourselves in the market with our technology and with our total cost of ownership story. So we are strongly positioned in EMEA altogether. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Congrats on the free cash flow. Why -- just a nitpicky one, then I have a follow-up. But why do you guys have the inflation, the material freight and labor inflation, ticking up quarter-to-quarter from 2Q to 3Q? Is that something to do with the comp from last year or something? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So there's 3 components to the inflation story. You have the material inflation, which is a $110 million headwind for the full year. Yes, you have actually a benefit in freight of about $40 million and labor is about $100 million. The benefit from freight is definitely front-end loaded. So of that $40 million, probably $30 million of it is in the first half, which provides an actual tailwind as you look at the second half versus the first half. In addition, we do see an uptick in labor inflation, partly because of the timing of pay raises, but also related to a foreign exchange dynamic in Mexico where we have some of our labor. So I would say those are probably the 2 most significant dynamics. It's pretty much just front half, back half dynamics in both freight and then also labor. \nC. Stephen Tusa: And then can you just help reconcile it? It just seems like the other guys, the other peers you compete against, their orders are trending better than you guys on a year-over-year basis. I know there's some difference in portfolio, there's some lumpiness. Or do you guys feel like you're being selective? Or you're kind of holding your own in these bids for now? \nGiordano Albertazzi: So there are 2 elements here. One is the normalization that we've been vocal about in the last 2 calls and this will continue. So that's a very normal, very healthy situation we're in. We certainly have very strong comparisons. This is certainly true. And we see pipelines growing. So I am positive about the trajectory we're on. I can't speak for other players. \nDavid Cote: Base period of comparison. \nGiordano Albertazzi: There is an element, exactly. Exactly. So if we go back to the beginning of the year, we were saying, hey, we are at $4.8 billion backlog, and we are likely going to shrink that, and we're going to probably consume this backlog. So here we are halfway through the year, that has not been the case. So we're positively surprised by that. We have a book-to-bill, 1. But only if we look at our book-to-bill on the 12 trailing months, then we are at 1.1. So there are multiple ways to look at this. And I recommend we don't just take things at their face value, but we double-click on what's really behind. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Yes, great. And then just one last one. On this new technology around cooling and just the proliferation of these AI-related data centers. Do you feel like you're going to need to, at some point, go and do invest more, whether it's through acquisitions or through technology at some stage to kind of bring more in-house? Or it's more steady as she goes as far as partnerships and developing internally? Is there a certain degree -- is there some sort of acquisition that you feel like you'll end up doing when you get better visibility on what the format is? \nGiordano Albertazzi: This technology is still at a very early stage. And as every technology at an early stage, you're looking at the opportunities through multiple lenses. One is the organic lenses, and we're certainly investing a lot, but we have partnerships as well. So there are multiple opportunities out there. We'll really see and be -- with a stronger balance sheet as well, we'll be focused on understanding exactly what's the best path going forward as the market matures. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: Just a question. What are typical lead times for thermal management products at this point, i.e., if data center owners are planning to buy these GPU chips, what lead times are you quoting for the related thermal products? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, that really depends on the customer request, of course. But in this moment, we have changed a lot from the situation in which we were in 2022, as we explained during the last earnings call, where we were out of the 50, 60 weeks lead time to much lower levels to the 30, 40 weeks and down from there further. So really, what requested lead times we get depends on the strategy of the various players. And do not think necessarily, if I may suggest, that it's an exact concatenation of when do I get the chip or the GPU and when I need the infrastructure because the 2 things go in parallel. And very often, the infrastructure comes first. So you will see probably some earlier infrastructure demand and when the bulk of the chips will be available for AI. But it's customer specific. For what we are concerned, we have moved down the path of shortening our lead times. And now we're able to serve the market with much shorter lead times than we did a year ago and indeed 3 months ago. That's [ exact cadence ]. \nAndrew Obin: And maybe just a follow-up, and I'll echo Steve's comment on cash. Could you give us some update, just more color on internal changes that you're making to improve cash? Changes on how you bill, payment terms, down payments? Just any color about sort of nuts and bolts of moving the needle there. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I think your words, nuts and bolts, probably is a pretty good description. We are similar to what we did from an operational perspective, notably in the Americas, is we are really getting into the basics and focusing on day-to-day execution. And we have a lot stronger visibility, transparency with where we are with particular payment terms with every customer. We get daily updates as it relates to inventory. And probably most importantly, we have a plan that we are executing against. So I would say there's been some early successes, but there still is a ton of opportunity out there. And this is -- was a focus as we exited last year, probably started in force mid last year, but it's also a huge cultural aspect. So when we talk about drumbeat and when we talk about financial metrics, we generally start with cash at this point in time. So we're encouraged with where we are but not satisfied. There's still a lot of work to do. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Congratulations on the strong results. The company had been expecting backlog to get worked down a bit this year as lead times normalize. But book-to-bill, as you mentioned, has come in at 1.0, approximately for both 1Q and 2Q. So given the upside in orders you've seen in the first half of the year, can you share your latest views on how you expect backlog to trend? Do you still think that comes down a bit this year? And then on a related topic, given the better-than-expected demand, do you think you need to put any more manufacturing capacity in place to support that? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. Well, thanks a lot for the question. So when it comes to the backlog, we have it planned for orders that sees our orders in Q3 and Q4 sequentially increase. And we'll see what the backlog does exactly. We still are in an unusually big backlog situation, given our historical trends and the historical trends in the industry. We were north of 70% coverage. We believe that anything above 50% is a good place to be. But yes, let's see how things unfold in that respect. Certainly, the pipeline strength is something that is encouraging in that respect. \nMark Delaney: And just operationally, in order to support the backlog, do you need to put any more capacity or you've got the [ exact ] facilities you need? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, we do have capacity. As I explained, we have increased investing in capacity in the last 12, 18 months. We are certainly extracting more capacity from what we have. We've been vocal many times about our Vertiv operating system, and that certainly is a big enabler for more capacity out of our current footprint. But we are very focused and very keen on building scenarios as to what exactly will happen. So we will move early if needed when we see that  there is an imbalance between the potential demand and our available capacity. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Giordano Albertazzi for closing remarks. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thanks a lot. Again, a good first half and looking forward to our second half, and looking forward to meeting you all in November. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Perfect. Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our second quarter financial results. As you can see, strong financial performance across the board, starting with our [indiscernible] from last year. 9% of that was from pricing and 16% from volume, with most of that volume benefit in the Americas, highlighting the continued supply chain and operational improvements in that region, which has been a pillar of our turnaround over the last 18 months or so. Adjusted operating profit of [indiscernible] quarter and adjusted operating margin of 14.5% improved 860 basis points, of which 610 was from higher variable contribution margin and 250 basis points was from fixed cost leverage. \n Adjusted operating profit was $61 million higher than our prior guidance, $45 million from higher pricing, $25 million from incremental volume and $15 million from lower-than-expected inflation with these tailwinds, partially offset by headwinds from foreign exchange and investment in fixed costs, primarily from restructuring and incentive compensation. Higher-than-expected pricing was driven by higher volume, favorable regional mix and some conservatism for potential pricing headwinds that did not materialize. Inflation was not as bad as we expected as commodity costs, including metals, declined from the end of the first quarter, likely influenced by a slower-than-expected rebound in the Chinese economy. \n Next, on this slide, and very proudly, we generated $227 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, an impressive $460 million higher than last year's second quarter. While there's still a lot of work to do to optimize working capital, our second quarter is reflective of our focus on cash and indicative of the cash generation potential of this business when we do control working capital, which increased just $5 million in the second quarter despite a $213 million increase in sales from the first quarter. \n Now the second quarter number was aided by some favorable timing tailwinds, and we should not expect free cash flow to be 130% of adjusted net income each quarter, but it shows we have made significant strides towards unlocking the cash generation potential of this business while funding organic growth. \n Last on this slide, net leverage declined to 3.1x at the end of the quarter and is expected to be approximately 2.3x by year-end, well within our previously communicated target leverage range of 2 to 3x. It was only a few months ago that we were being labeled by some and likely discounted from a multiple perspective as highly levered. We argued at the time that it was pursuant to a mechanical calculation and just a matter of timing. Well, I think we were proven correct as our year-to-date performance has now driven that mechanical calculation towards what we believe to be the practical reality. \n Turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. The Americas region continues to show strong year-over-year performance with organic net sales growth of $0.48 including 35% from volume and 13% from pricing. Adjusted operating margin improved 12.3 percentage points on the strength of price cost, fixed cost leverage and notably improved operating results from E&I.\n APAC top line continues to be influenced by slower-than-expected recovery in China. Volume was relatively flat, so our organic growth was driven by incremental pricing. Adjusted operating margin declined about 100 basis points from last year, and that was primarily driven by approximately $6 million of restructuring costs in the quarter. We do anticipate sequential quarterly sales growth in APAC in the third quarter but we have reduced our full year projection from our prior guidance, now expecting full year low single-digit growth. \n EMEA grew organically 9% in the second quarter almost entirely driven by pricing. We expect third quarter sale EMEA to be down slightly from the second quarter, with a significant increase in the fourth quarter and full year growth expected to be in the upper single digits. EMEA continues to impress from an adjusted operating margin perspective, posting 26.6% for the second quarter, 870 basis points higher than last year, with this increase primarily driven by price cost and fixed cost leverage.\n Finally, on this page, corporate costs were $21 million higher than last year, driven by higher restructuring and incentive compensation costs and an incremental $5 million loss on foreign exchange. Based on the current guidance, we anticipate these incremental costs at our corporate entity to flow through for the full year, and we expect second half corporate cost to be consistent with the first half. \n Next, turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our third quarter guidance. As a reminder, we have anticipated a more stable quarterly sequential sales cadence as we proceed through 2023. For this reason, our third quarter guidance looks largely consistent with our second quarter in absolute terms. We have included provision for sequential increases in both pricing and inflation in the third quarter and sequential headwinds from foreign exchange, including $15 million on sales and $5 million on adjusted operating profit.\n Moving to Slide 10, our full year guidance. We are raising our projected top line by $285 million, primarily driven by higher expected sales in the Americas, partially offset by lower expected sales in APAC with EMEA consistent with prior guidance. We are raising our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance by $150 million, $60 million from the second quarter beat and $90 million in the second half. This increase translates into a 170 basis point increase in our expected adjusted operating margin to 14%. And while we have not explicitly provided fourth quarter guidance, math suggests we exit the year at 15%, edging closer to our intermediate-term target of 16%, which should provide good momentum transitioning into 2024. \n And finally, on this page, we are increasing our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance by $200 million at the midpoint to $550 million. This is an $810 million improvement over last year and demonstrates momentum not only with our drive for profitability but also with our management of working capital. \n Before I hand it back over to Gio, let me front run some potential questions on our adjusted free cash flow guidance, which implies approximately $300 million of free cash flow in the second half, which is $150 million lower than our second quarter number multiplied by 2. The primary driver of this variance is timing, timing for both CapEx and cash taxes, which are normally back half loaded, and this year is no exception. These 2 items explain approximately $130 million of the $150 million variance. The remainder is driven by higher use of cash from trade working capital as we prepare for strong anticipated demand in 2024, and that being partially offset by higher projected EBITDA and lower cash interest.\n So with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. Yes. From a quarterly cadence perspective, pricing, 9% first quarter, 9% second quarter, 7% in the third quarter, and 5% in the fourth. So full year, $420 million, it's up about $120 million from our prior guidance, and it's probably too early at this point to comment on 2024 pricing. But we should have a nice tailwind heading into next year. Yes. First, let me say, it's very nice to have this conversation because we couldn't have asked this a year ago. So at this point, we're going to get through this year. And we will share in our investor conference our further thoughts on capital allocation. We certainly are participating in an industry where there should be plenty of growth, and there's probably plenty of opportunity to continue to reinvest in the business. But we do recognize that we will have to make some strategic decisions with what to do with some excess cash. I think as we said previously, we do believe there are some accretive strategic acquisitions out there. That is probably something we would look at first, but we'll be able to give a lot more detail in November. Yes. I think the easy answer is higher. But if you look at where we were last year -- and we've disclosed this in the past. We were probably in the low 30s from a variable contribution margin perspective. We're in the upper 30s at this point in time. Let's call it the mid- to upper 30s. So if you look at the projected 600-plus basis point increase in operating margin this year versus last year, about 400 of that is related to the variable contribution margin and 200 is related to fixed cost leverage. And I definitely don't want to discount the power of the fixed cost constant methodology and culture. That should continue to provide upward momentum on the operating profit. So as we've consistently said, 16% has been our intermediate-term goal. We have high confidence of getting there for sure, but we're not celebrating. Our long-term goal is 20% and higher. But to get to that level, Jeff, to your question, we're going to have to continue to improve with the contribution margin while also incorporating that fixed cost leverage philosophy. Yes. So there's 3 components to the inflation story. You have the material inflation, which is a $110 million headwind for the full year. Yes, you have actually a benefit in freight of about $40 million and labor is about $100 million. The benefit from freight is definitely front-end loaded. So of that $40 million, probably $30 million of it is in the first half, which provides an actual tailwind as you look at the second half versus the first half. In addition, we do see an uptick in labor inflation, partly because of the timing of pay raises, but also related to a foreign exchange dynamic in Mexico where we have some of our labor. So I would say those are probably the 2 most significant dynamics. It's pretty much just front half, back half dynamics in both freight and then also labor. Yes. I think your words, nuts and bolts, probably is a pretty good description. We are similar to what we did from an operational perspective, notably in the Americas, is we are really getting into the basics and focusing on day-to-day execution. And we have a lot stronger visibility, transparency with where we are with particular payment terms with every customer. We get daily updates as it relates to inventory. And probably most importantly, we have a plan that we are executing against. So I would say there's been some early successes, but there still is a ton of opportunity out there. And this is -- was a focus as we exited last year, probably started in force mid last year, but it's also a huge cultural aspect. So when we talk about drumbeat and when we talk about financial metrics, we generally start with cash at this point in time. So we're encouraged with where we are but not satisfied. There's still a lot of work to do."

            "name": "Giordano Albertazzi",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Dave. We saw the positive momentum continuing into second quarter across all key financial metrics. Second quarter sales were up 25% organically, led again by a 48% increase in Americas. We continue to see supply chain improvements and increased resiliency. We saw healthy market demand, which supported the shipment of substantial volume in the Americas region. Orders excluding FX, were down just 3% from last year's second quarter better than anticipated, and book-to-bill remained at 1. Despite ongoing order normalization as well as difficult comparison, the market remains healthy. We have also seen an encouraging AI-related activity, and I'll elaborate on this when we cover Slide 6. \n Our adjusted operating profit was $251 million, and we saw benefits from our increased volume as well as price cost. Our adjusted operating profit margin improved 860 basis points to 14.5% as we continue to strengthen operational execution. I am particularly pleased to report the strong adjusted free cash flow of $227 million in second quarter. We also continue to see the leverage profile of the business to improve at 3.1x at the end of Q2 as the balance sheet continues to strengthen. These are early successes and still much more opportunity ahead. We are raising fairly significantly our full year guidance. And are now expecting sales for the full year to be up 20% organically, AOP at $950 million at the midpoint and adjusted free cash flow of $550 million at the midpoint. We are executing our plan to deliver the full year 1 quarter at a time, and our transformation continues. \n We are making meaningful steps forward in our operational execution. We are demonstrating clear traction and there is tremendous value creation ahead. We're not relenting our focus on operational execution, that is what we intend to continue to demonstrate each and every quarter. \n So let's now turn to Page 4. A few changes on the market environment slide. First, we moved cloud hyperscale to green in EMEA. Globally, we have seen an acceleration in the cloud hyperscale and colocation market segment in the last 90 days, substantiated by the large amount of incremental capacity that is being planned as well as by the amount of leasing capacity that was signed in the -- in this past quarter gigawatts of new capacity.\n Our pipelines have clearly strengthened. It is hard to delineate what is AI and what is not. But we know the industry is certainly getting ready for AI, and we have orders in our books and opportunities in our pipeline that are unequivocally for AI infrastructure. \n Conversations with cloud and colo players are now around making sure there is available capacity to support a healthy outlook, and we are in discussions with several large and relevant customers on what this commercial arrangement can look like, very encouraging. \n As we move to telecom, this area has further weakened in the last 90 days, with some further carving of spent by the major telco carriers. We anticipate the telecom markets remain quiet for the balance of 2023, not particularly worrisome. These patterns are not atypical for this market. We have left the APAC market yellow across the segments. The China market specifically, experienced a slower-than-expected start to the year, not just for us but for most companies. In our current view, we are not anticipating much recovery in China market in 2023, but there are some encouraging signs as we see orders turned positive in Q2 and pipelines are healthy. No changes in view on enterprise SMB or commercial and industrial. Overall, I'm more encouraged today than 90 days ago, given clear demand signals from the cloud hyperscale colocation markets that support our view for second half '23 and shape our thinking around 2024.\n Let's move to Slide 5. Orders performed better than anticipated, although down 3%, they are coming together stronger than expected, and they were 13% sequentially up from Q1. Book-to-bill ratio of 1 preserves a healthy backlog. We anticipate orders flat more or less in Q3 and turning positive in Q4. \n I know everyone is interested in what AI orders looks -- looked like in the quarter. And candidly, that would be almost impossible to answer with precision. We have seen AI-related orders, I would say, in the tens of millions of dollars. Our customers are focused on AI retrofit rate infrastructure, and we see evidence of this in our pipelines. Many of our products today can be used for either regular density or high-density applications, and we won't be able to report out a discrete AI number. For example, most AI viewed today are still being air cooled, perfectly served by the traditional vertical portfolio. Over time, a part of these loads will transition to liquid. And here too, we are uniquely positioned, liquid to remove heat from the server and the rack, but removal of the heat doesn't stop outside the rack. You need to remove the heat from the data hole, and we have a portfolio of solutions to do just that.\n As I say, we are seeing clear demand acceleration signals from the market, and we are having conversations with very relevant market players, around securing capacity and not just over the next few quarters, but well in '24 and beyond. \n Let us transition to supply chain. We see improving the environment but there are 2 parts to this story. First, supply chain continues to incrementally improve. No doubt, lead times are gradually reducing, and there is more certainty supply. The second part is the self-health part. We have been vocal about our multi-sourcing programs. One of the most important architects of this ongoing supply chain resilience program, Paul Ryan, is now our leader of global procurement. He is not new to me or Vertiv. He has been with us over a decade and has more than 25 years of experience and a strong track record operational execution combined with very clear strategic vision. Supply chain resilience is key considering the demand waves that may be ahead. \n Let's now talk capacity. We have been investing in capacity for a few years in a balanced approach across the globe. [indiscernible] The focus is on utilizing and coordinating capacity globally. We have recently announced a new role in the organization, Executive Vice President, Manufacturing, Logistics and Operational Excellence with Andrew's -- [ Anders Carberry ] leading the effort. Over the last 5 years, [ Anders ] led Vertiv's operations in Asia, then EMEA and finally, Americas. In the Americas operations over the past year, specifically, we have seen significant improvements. He's the right person to take the organization to the next level on process and operations improvement as well as company-wide deployment of Vertiv operating system. Our ability to navigate strong periods of growth in a complex environment continues to improve. \n Let's talk about inflation. While inflation is trending a bit more favorably than anticipated, a couple of dynamics influence the second half of 2023. First, metal prices were at lower levels in Q3 and Q4 over the last year. So as we lap that comparison, we're experiencing year-on-year inflation, a bitter higher, a bit higher in the second half. We also anticipate when the Chinese economy accelerates, that increased demand could cause additional inflationary pressure on commodities. We have seen a favorable tailwind from price cost with good processes in place that better prepare us for volatility related to our input costs. \n Let's go to Slide 6. We believe AI will increase our overall TAM. AI is a reinforcement of demand trend and AI workloads are incremental to new applications. They aren't in general, replacing other applications in our digital economy. We expect growth in both high-density and general compute. This benefits all Vertiv technologies. We believe liquid cooling is not a displacement risk and, in fact, is additive to growth for Vertiv. Before liquid cooling, we would take the heat from it outside the rack to outside the data center building. With liquid cooling, it's additive. We reach out into the rack and get one step closer to the heat generation point while still controlling all parts of the heat rejection.\n The infrastructure transition to AI, high-density environment will be complicated and likely involve hybrid approaches to technology deployment. It is very likely a data center will need both liquid and air cooling orchestrated tightly together to optimize the data center environment. We do very well with that approach with the widest portfolio of thermal technology available, deepest domain expertise on how to orchestrate these technologies using our advanced control systems. \n Hence over 3,500 field service engineers across the world to support the deployment and maintenance of the infrastructure. We have the scale and the ability to increase capacity. And I hope -- and I believe you can sense my excitement. Much more to come on high-density AI at our Investor conference in November, but feel very well positioned for this opportunity. \n With that, over to Dave. Well, thanks a lot. As Dave said earlier, great quarter. There's still a lot to do. In February -- in our February call, I went through the focus areas for 2023, creating a high-performance culture where ownership is clear, and we hold ourselves accountable for the results, constant focus on things that matter, and executing relentless focus on execution. At the halfway mark of 2023, we have made progress.\n Innovation and technology continue to be a key differentiator for Vertiv. And with our ongoing investment in this area, I'm very encouraged by our road maps for R&D and technology development. I believe you will see this momentum building and differentiation further distinguish Vertiv as the partner of choice in critical infrastructure. I continue to travel around the globe visiting customers in Vertiv locations, and key industry players are more excited today than I have been in the last 25 years with this great organization. I can feel the energy, the momentum building in our business, in our industry. It is tangible. This traction is not easy to translate in words, but you are starting to see the transformation taking hold, deepening and becoming Vertiv's DNA. \n So the takeaways. Strong first half, supported by continued improvements in operational execution, a healthy market, momentum continuing, in fact, increasing with AI tailwinds. We are raising our guidance across all financial metrics and especially pleased to be raising our adjusted operating profit guidance to $950 million at the midpoint. This indicates a healthy second half and a great foundation for 2024. \n An important reminder, Vertiv's Investors Conference on November 29th at the New York Stock Exchange. So I truly hope you can join us and make sure you mark that in your calendars. \n With that, over to the operator. Yes, 2 aspects to this, Nigel. Thank you for the question. There is certainly a kind of a non-retrofit new market, new data center, and it's a place, this one, where our service organization becomes absolutely critical in our ability to partner with customers everywhere in the world. Not all the players in specifically the liquid part of the thermal spectrum have this ability to reach out everywhere as we are. And we have demonstrated that, and our numbers prove that. As I was saying, 3,500 service engineers globally. \n But the other is we see it today and we talk with our customers today, and they say, not only do we have to think about liquid cooling. But the thing that we have to think about is a hybrid environment probably in an initial build that has more traditional server cooling. So there needs to be an ability to retrofit over time because the sites will hybridize and we enable that. And then being there with our customers to execute on that retrofit is again fundamental. And that retrofit is not just the rack itself or the row, but it's the ability to interconnect and balance it with the rest of the existing thermal system. \n But think about the stock of data center that exists in the industry today. It's really hard to believe that, that part will not be hybrid in and of itself. And that's what we hear. That's what we hear today. Today, we hear people saying, hey, we are already today sometimes having AI-enabling high-density racks, and we air cool them. But that sounds easier said than done, then you have to balance, of course, the cooling in the hole. But at the same time, that very same retrofit can be a liquid retrofit eventually. And again, the same problem exists. Even more complicated, if you will, than with an infrastructure that was thought for future retrofit. Hope I answered. It could be very long. I will avoid. We don't have exactly a figure on that. Well, the acceleration of pipeline that I referred to in my -- when we were going through the slide is specific to industry -- sorry, to region and customer, really. So it varies, but acceleration it is. How big? It is, again, part of a wave of demand, as I explained. This is additional demand, and it is additional demand that will probably drive also the more traditional type of loads and compute further up. Specifically, the comment about EMEA is that we start to see this effect hit EMEA as well. And anyway, we wanted to send the message that we see acceleration on colo cloud across the board because of AI. How big, exactly? Again, it's premature to say. The market is moving. I would say it's hard to distinguish what is AI and what is not, but we know that some technologies, specifically for high-density, specifically for GPU. And that is a little bit earlier to track. But we know that there are a lot of traditional technologies, a lot of traditional technologies that are there to enable AI as well. And that's true for the power part of our portfolio and for the thermal part of our portfolio. So I want to reiterate the message that I had when I was going through the slides is that when we talk about liquid cooling here, we really talk about how we extract heat from the heat generation point, i.e., the chip to outside the server outside the rack and into the data hole, this is the novelty. This is the new part. As I was saying, actually, there are 3 ways to make that extraction. A, continue to do it through air. And we have seen air-cooled racks going all the way to north of 40 kilowatts per rack density. But clearly, at a certain stage, as one of our slides was explaining, at a certain stage, liquid kicks in. Liquid kicks in, in form of immersion or direct-to-chip. We have both in our portfolio. And also, we're partnering with people that handle both. But the fact is we think -- we believe that the main technology going forward when it comes to liquid is really direct-to-chip. But again, it is certainly a portfolio approach that we're taking. Well, it's a bit a lot of detail and also, premature for those details. But I go back to the point I made at the beginning, we see this as additive. So it is another technology. We did not participate in the heat sink or extraction of the heat from the server. Now we started to participate also in that part of the equation. So a bit premature, but I want to make sure we understand that is something, an addition for us. But that absolutely dovetails in what you're asking for. Maybe I can start with a little bit of the 3 points you were talking and were asking about: price, cost and execution. I mean this is something we've been absolutely vocal about in the last 3 calls, as a matter of fact, this included. There's certainly a lot of price efforts and successful execution, as David explained also, our outlook. But what is most important is our price cost. When we were talking about price, I was vocal about the fact that we have now a muscle that we did not have before, and that has helped a lot to rebalance back to the position, let's say, pretty big inflation position. .\n When it comes to the cost side of the equation, we have a lot of focus on efficiency, be that in manufacturing execution, be that in procurement. And there is still potential -- there's still potential in general. Execution, in particular, is true across the organization. But I can point particularly to the execution that we have started to drive in the procurement and manufacturing and ability to ship. That has certainly characterized and accelerated our ability to deliver on a strong backlog we enter 2023 with. \n So we will have time in November to go to more details of exactly what are the axis of this acceleration. But I was vocal about our internal promotion of Paul and [ Anders ] as a further step in the direction that is testament to the fact that we are not done yet. And that's very good news. I don't know if you... Nicole, not much really to add to what we were saying. We continue to see that demand fairly, fairly stable. The technology continues to be evolving for everyone in the industry, and that's not just colo hyperscale. But again, not a lot to elaborate upon here. We see -- we've seen some stability in that space. I would say that we have done a very, very good job operationally in terms of positioning ourselves in the market with our technology and with our total cost of ownership story. So we are strongly positioned in EMEA altogether. So there are 2 elements here. One is the normalization that we've been vocal about in the last 2 calls and this will continue. So that's a very normal, very healthy situation we're in. We certainly have very strong comparisons. This is certainly true. And we see pipelines growing. So I am positive about the trajectory we're on. I can't speak for other players. There is an element, exactly. Exactly. So if we go back to the beginning of the year, we were saying, hey, we are at $4.8 billion backlog, and we are likely going to shrink that, and we're going to probably consume this backlog. So here we are halfway through the year, that has not been the case. So we're positively surprised by that. We have a book-to-bill, 1. But only if we look at our book-to-bill on the 12 trailing months, then we are at 1.1. So there are multiple ways to look at this. And I recommend we don't just take things at their face value, but we double-click on what's really behind. This technology is still at a very early stage. And as every technology at an early stage, you're looking at the opportunities through multiple lenses. One is the organic lenses, and we're certainly investing a lot, but we have partnerships as well. So there are multiple opportunities out there. We'll really see and be -- with a stronger balance sheet as well, we'll be focused on understanding exactly what's the best path going forward as the market matures. Well, that really depends on the customer request, of course. But in this moment, we have changed a lot from the situation in which we were in 2022, as we explained during the last earnings call, where we were out of the 50, 60 weeks lead time to much lower levels to the 30, 40 weeks and down from there further. So really, what requested lead times we get depends on the strategy of the various players. And do not think necessarily, if I may suggest, that it's an exact concatenation of when do I get the chip or the GPU and when I need the infrastructure because the 2 things go in parallel. And very often, the infrastructure comes first. So you will see probably some earlier infrastructure demand and when the bulk of the chips will be available for AI. But it's customer specific. For what we are concerned, we have moved down the path of shortening our lead times. And now we're able to serve the market with much shorter lead times than we did a year ago and indeed 3 months ago. That's [ exact cadence ]. Yes. Well, thanks a lot for the question. So when it comes to the backlog, we have it planned for orders that sees our orders in Q3 and Q4 sequentially increase. And we'll see what the backlog does exactly. We still are in an unusually big backlog situation, given our historical trends and the historical trends in the industry. We were north of 70% coverage. We believe that anything above 50% is a good place to be. But yes, let's see how things unfold in that respect. Certainly, the pipeline strength is something that is encouraging in that respect. Well, we do have capacity. As I explained, we have increased investing in capacity in the last 12, 18 months. We are certainly extracting more capacity from what we have. We've been vocal many times about our Vertiv operating system, and that certainly is a big enabler for more capacity out of our current footprint. But we are very focused and very keen on building scenarios as to what exactly will happen. So we will move early if needed when we see that  there is an imbalance between the potential demand and our available capacity. Well, thanks a lot. Again, a good first half and looking forward to our second half, and looking forward to meeting you all in November."

            "content": "Well, these last few quarters have been a lot more enjoyable to report. We had another strong quarter of performance in Vertiv, which positions us very well to achieve our significantly increased 2023 outlook. Adjusted free cash flow, adjusted operating profit, sales and margins all performed very well and operational execution continues to improve. We've raised our full year guidance because of our strong first half performance. We also have the very pleasant effect of a strengthening balance sheet. The data center end market continues to look very healthy, and there is an incremental tailwind from AI coming. And that tailwind should provide additional opportunities over many years for Vertiv because our technology will matter. A great market position, a great industry where we can differentiate with technology, these attributes are what attracted me to Vertiv over 4 years ago, and they are truer today than ever. \n We're obviously pleased with the results, but there is so much more to come. There's a lot of upside, not just in the market and our technology, but also just continuing to fix legacy process issues and building a high-performance culture which didn't exist. Gio and his team are off to a great start, and there is a lot of work left to be done, but it is also [indiscernible] supports more consistent execution over the long term.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio. Base period of comparison."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded. \n I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations, to begin. So Lynne, please go ahead. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Vertiv's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Giordano Albertazzi; and Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon. \n Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings made with the SEC. \n Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. \n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Well, it's one hell of a debut for our new CEO's first quarter isn't it? I am very pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter and our ongoing progress. Gio's first quarter as CEO is under his belt, and his operational focus on delivering results and creating a high-performance culture is particularly noticeable, especially in the Americas. \n We over-delivered in the first quarter compared to guidance and we increased the midpoint of our AOP guidance by $25 million, and cash flow was terrific. We entered the year with a very strong backlog. We were able to secure needed parts and we had capacity in place to deliver a high Q1 sales level.\n Order rates will be another metric that looks different this year. Gio has some detail in his prepared remarks to explain that. We are constantly focused on the orders rate, and we are encouraged both by the pipeline activity and the pace of investment in our end markets. I've said this for a number of years. There is a true secular growth story at Vertiv and the work we have done in positioning the company for growth and being able to leverage that growth in a meaningful way by getting after margin opportunities while still protecting growth investment makes Vertiv uniquely positioned to create substantial value in the years ahead. It is what attracted me to this assets 4 years ago, and I'm even more excited today with the runway ahead. \n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you, Dave. Thank you very much, and good day, everyone. So we delivered a very strong first quarter sales, up 35% organically, led by Americas, up over 60% and EMEA, up 25%. We were able to ship more in Q1 than a typical first quarter as we strengthened our supply chain and increase capacity across the world, in particular, in our Monterrey thermal management facility. \n We had very high backlog starting the year, and we have the capacity to serve the growing demand of the industry. Orders excluding FX, were down 23% from last year's first quarter. This was in line with our expectations, driven by the comparison with an exceptionally high Q1 '22 and consistent with the orders normalization trend we referred to in February. Book-to-bill ratio was 1x and backlog remained flat versus year-end '22, our historical peak. I will further elaborate on this when we review Slide 6. \n Our adjusted operating profit was $176 million, which was $41 million higher than the top end of our guidance. The beat was largely driven by additional volume and higher-than-expected variable contribution margin coming from a combination of manufacturing efficiency and supply chain efficiency. We are raising our full year adjusted operating profit guidance by $25 million at the midpoint, given the strong first quarter results. \n Adjusted free cash flow was another good story with $25 million cash generation in the quarter, $100 million higher than our guidance. Although we're pleased with our first quarter performance, we know very well there is still work to do. We are holding the adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year at $350 million, i.e., the previous midpoint, but we understand there is ample opportunity for improvement and certainly in inventory. \n We are continuing to strengthen our processes and operational rigor around trade working capital execution. So overall, a good start, and we are squarely focused on delivering the full year, and that is one quarter at a time. \n And let us turn to Slide 4. We have no changes to the view on the market from 2 months ago at the end of February. We are cognizant of the headlines around tech and the general uncertainty around macro environment, we continue to see encouraging pipeline activity. Some cloud hyperscale customers are digesting capacity. Others are using this as an opportunity to accelerate their build-outs. Some hyperscalers are moderating CapEx growth, that this moderate growth is still healthy growth. And we see investment continuing. \n Additionally, we see some market reacceleration in the second half of the year, especially in China, which has been softer over the last several quarters. As Dave mentioned, there is significant secular growth story in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the acceleration of everything artificial intelligence in the tech space. We are distinctly seeing the first signs of the AI investment cycle in our pipelines and orders. Vertiv is uniquely positioned to win here given our market leadership and deep domain expertise in areas like thermal management and controls, which are vital to support the complexity of future AI infrastructures. \n Let's move to Slide 5. First and most importantly, markets are, in general, healthy. Investment continues across markets, hyperscale, colos, enterprise. Our project pipeline remains strong. We review pipeline activity regularly and diligently, and pipeline activity remains encouraging. First quarter orders, including the impact of foreign exchange, declined 23%. There are order dynamics that are important to unfold. So we have provided additional details in the next slide. More comments then. \n Let me go back to the investments in AI. You may have heard it as generally characterized as the next infrastructure arms race, Vertiv benefits from this race and is an agnostic partner of choice to the risk participants. The acceleration in investment in AI will turn into a net infrastructure capacity demand acceleration, and this starts to be visible in our pipelines. AI applications demand a net capacity increase in the industry, higher power density, a gradual migration to an air and liquid hybrid cooling environment and a transition to liquid-ready facility designed. \n I do not believe there is anyone else in the data center infrastructure space as well positioned as Vertiv even our expertise broaden technology portfolio, infrastructure system view and advanced control systems. \n Already today, some AI infrastructure orders are in our backlog, and we are encouraged by the potential that AI represents for Vertiv. So supply chain, it is incrementally better. There are still pockets of tightness in electronics, but the relentless qualification of additional suppliers we have driven in the last 12 months is helping us a lot. \n Inflation. We anticipate metal cost at lower levels in '23 versus '22, although they are starting to trend upwards, a more favorable environment on freight, reduced spot buy activity that both trending back to historic levels and that are good offset. I also like to remind that we have built up a robust pricing process that helps us in case of enduring inflation. Any overall price cost is developing according to plan and consistent with expectations. \n Let's now move to Slide 6. Let me here elaborate on future Q1 orders, order normalization and lead times. Indeed, last year's Q1 poses an exceptionally challenging comparison with orders up 34% from the first quarter of 2021. We will see some quarter-to-quarter variation due to timing of large projects, but last year's first quarter was exceptionally in that sense. We believe order normalization is very real. We talked about this in February 2022. \n In February. In 2022, the large hyperscale and colocation customers were giving us orders that covered their requirements for extended period. As I mentioned, some going out 18-plus months due to the challenging supply chain and lead time situation in the industry. They wanted to secure the capacity they needed long term. That behavior was particularly pronounced in our thermal line of business. \n Now that our lead times are improving, not yet where we want them to be, but much better than last year. We anticipate they will continue to improve going forward. \n Now that our lead times are improving, I would say, customers are more comfortable releasing orders at a much more normal cadence. This creates short-term air pocket but does not impact the volume or timing of what we will ultimately ship to customers. Order patterns are just normalizing. This is healthy for our business and the industry. So what does that leave us? We are encouraged that our book-to-bill ratio is 1x. And our backlog remains at the same level we had at the end of 2022, even with an extremely strong shipment quarter in Q1 where organic sales were increased 35%. Worth signaling an approximately 12% 3-year order CAGR that reflects good end market demand. \n We believe that Q1 2023 will remain the most unfavorable year-over-year quarterly comparison in 2023, we believe it improves from here. We still anticipate a reduction in Q2 23 orders versus prior year, but improving relative to Q1. It is hard to have a crystal ball into second half of 2023. But with what I hear from customers, including what seems to be forming into a substantial investment cycle for AI. I remain optimistic that year-over-year orders will turn positive when we get to later quarters. \n Having said that, I'll pass it over to David, who will walk us through the financials. Over to you, David. \nDavid Fallon: Perfect. Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter financial results. As you can see, we exceeded the high end of guidance for all metrics on this slide, starting with sales, which were up organically $405 million or 35% from last year's first quarter. $105 million of this increase was from pricing and $300 million from volume, which was up approximately $100 million versus what we assumed in guidance. \n A vast majority of this volume increase was based in the Americas as we continue to see significant improvements in supply chain and manufacturing efficiency and the 2 are related in that region. And it all starts with, and it's supported by a sound SIOP process. \n Adjusted operating profit of $176 million was $163 million higher than last year's first quarter. and $41 million higher than the top end of guidance, and this was primarily due to volume leverage and a higher contribution margin percentage driven by the improved manufacturing efficiency in our North American plants as once again, supply chain issues continue to be addressed and process improvements take hold. \n Of note at the very bottom of the second gray box at the bottom of this page, we recognized a $13 million charge for restructuring in the quarter, and you can see that on the face of our income statement. \n In the spirit of winning now and winning later, while we continuously invest in productivity and efficiency projects, we will overdrive these investments when opportunities present themselves. -- well, in the first quarter, an $8 million onetime gain related to the reversal of an indemnification claim pursuant to the Emerson carve-out provided that opportunity. Instead of dropping this gain to the bottom line, we accelerated restructuring projects costing $13 million, which should drive $20 million of annualized savings, some of which should benefit the later part of 2023. Once again, winning now and winning later. \n Moving to the right on this slide, adjusted free cash flow of $25 million was $175 million higher than last year and $100 million better than the midpoint of guidance. Improvement versus both last year and guidance was driven by higher adjusted operating profit, and significant progress in driving advanced payments from customers. As Gio mentioned, while there is still work to do across all trade working capital categories, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter, and we anticipate continued improvement going forward. \n Finally, on this slide, if you look at the bottom right-hand corner of that last box, we exited the first quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of approximately 4.3x and that was down from 5.5x at year-end. While net debt did not significantly change our trailing 12-month adjusted operating profit increased approximately $163 million from year-end as the $13 million from the first quarter of last year was replaced by the $176 million this year. \n As we reminded folks in February, although mechanical leverage calculations might have wrote and one could say maybe even lazily classified us as higher leverage. We do not believe that was consistent with the underlying reality but more a product of timing in our challenged first half of 2022. Based upon our updated guidance, we expect to be between 3.5 and 4x after the second quarter and approximately 3x at year-end, which is at the top end of our 2 to 3x long-term target range. \n Next, turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. The Americas region had year-over-year organic sales growth of 61%, and that's not a typo. -- including volume of 48% and pricing of 13%. Americas entered the year with a very strong backlog and with improvements in the SIOP process and the supply chain, coupled with the continued capacity ramp-up in our new thermal facility in Monterrey, we were able to drive significant top line volume growth. \n EMEA also benefiting from a strong backlog, posted organic growth of 26%, including 17% from volume and 9% from pricing. APAC is somewhat an outlier compared to the other 2 regions for the first quarter. While we had good growth in India and Southeast Asia, China continued to be impacted by the effects of the post-COVID recovery and related project pushouts to the second quarter and back half of the year. \n Based upon our visibility to an improving pipeline driven by the anticipated macroeconomic recovery and government-sponsored actions that should benefit data centers, we remain optimistic, anticipating mid- to upper single-digit organic growth in APAC for 2023 and good momentum heading into 2024. \n At the bottom of the slide, Americas continued its momentum from the second half of 2022 with adjusted operating margin of 22.1%, 11.3 percentage points higher than last year's first quarter and 160 basis points better than the fourth quarter. About half of the improvement was driven by higher variable contribution margin, including a significant price cost benefit with the other half from fixed cost leverage as we continue to drive our fixed cost constant philosophy while investing in capacity and technology. \n EMEA adjusted operating margin also improved nicely from last year's first quarter by over 700 basis points with about half of that improvement from fixed cost leverage. Finally, APAC, their adjusted operating margin, like its top line remained relatively flat from last year.\n Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our second quarter guidance. As we mentioned in our press release, due to our strong beginning of the year backlog and an improved supply chain, we anticipate quarterly seasonality to look a bit different in 2023 compared with historic patterns. As a result, we are not projecting as a significant incremental jump in top line from the first quarter to the second quarter, like prior years, and we should see a more uniform quarterly sales pattern, albeit increasing as we sequentially move through 2023. \n For the second quarter, we anticipate organic sales growth of 15%, with 9% from volume and 6% from pricing. We are projecting adjusted operating profit of $190 million at the midpoint, with pricing, volume and productivity benefits partially offset by inflation and growth investments with the resulting adjusted operating margin up 600 basis points from prior year. We have not provided adjusted free cash flow guidance for the second quarter, but we expect positive cash flow in each of the remaining quarters with sequential increases, and we reiterate our full year guidance on the next slide, which is a good segue. \n Moving to the next slide, Slide 10, where we summarize our full year guidance. We have raised our -- as Gio mentioned, we have raised our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance by $25 million at the midpoint, building on our strong first quarter performance. Although we experienced favorable supply chain dynamics in the first quarter, there remains uncertainty in certain pockets of our procurement, including notably power semiconductors. So we are approaching volume estimates for the rest of the year with caution. This may be perceived as conservatism, but we believe it is the prudent approach at this point based upon the supply chain volatility we have all seen in the last 18 months, as we know, things can change quickly. \n We are guiding full year adjusted operating margin of 12.3% as we continue our progress towards an anticipated 16% in the intermediate term and 20% in the long term. And as I mentioned, we are reiterating our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the full year of $350 million at the midpoint. \n With that said, I turn it back over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you, David. Let us then turn to Slide 11, and let's summarize the key takeaways. So a very good first quarter. Momentum is continuing. Market remains healthy, and we benefit from having a large backlog and a better supply chain and more capacity. We are raising our AOP guidance given a good Q1 performance. \n I am very pleased to announce Vertiv will be hosting its first Investor Conference on November 29 at the New York Stock Exchange. More details certainly to come, but already now, hope your pencil is down your calendars, and we hope you will be able to join us. \n As Dave, Dave Cote is known for saying, \"The trick is in the doing and we are getting after the doing.\" And that means a strong execution, supported by a high-performing team and culture, make sure there are no shortcuts, no magic wands, the doing is clarity of vision, alignment and relentless focus on improvement and execution. \n I am very proud of the staff [indiscernible] we continue to take as an organization, and I want to thank the entire Vertiv team for the ever-increasing focus and passion and execution. We are still in the early stages of our acceleration. And after my first quarter as a CEO, I'm more optimistic than ever about our path ahead. \n With that, we will now turn the call over to the operator who will open the line for questions for us. Thank you very much. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Gio, could you give us a little more color into your end markets and elaborate on your comments that you think orders could turn positive later this year? I think some investors are probably surprised that cloud and colocation markets in the Americas have hung in as well as they have. So maybe more specific color on those markets? And then how much of the incremental orders or pipeline that you see -- or would you say more AI focused? And what gives you the confidence that China is going to come back in the second half of the year? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Okay. Well, thank you for your question, Andy. I would say that many elements for this confidence. One is what we see in the pipelines and pipelines are moving, we are definitely pleased by our book-to-bill ratio at 1, as we were saying, especially given the overage in sales relative to Q1 guidance. But as we said, the -- especially the hyperscalers and not stopping their investment. \n We also heard some prominent hyperscalers in the last few days, sending messages about their infrastructure spend. So there is positivity in the year. And again, that resounds with our -- with what we see in the pipeline. \n Now we talked last time about normalization, and that's what we continue to see. So do not be surprised when we will see still the second quarter that on a competitive basis will be down year-on-year, but up in absolute terms versus Q1 as we were saying. But again, there is movement out there. There is a positivity. \n Now not all the hyperscalers are exactly in the same place or all the colos are in the same place, but many of the large ones are -- continues to plan capacity expansion. It is difficult to your point about AI. It's difficult to really draw a line between AI investment, enabling investment and other investments. I would say that the line is blurring. One would think that AI is a totally new thing. Certainly, generative AI is accelerating very rapidly. But there are elements in AI and everything we do today already. So if anything, we see an acceleration not a sharp transition to something completely new. \n But we see AI in terms of the type of conversations and specifications that we see coming our way. And again, as I was saying, when going through the slides, a lot about power density, and a lot about bigger capacity investments, kind of bigger chunks and that's encouraging. \n So again, AI as a transition and I invite everyone to think AI more in terms of a transition towards a higher density, higher density compute and high-density power as a consequence. \n You were asking about China. We believe China will reaccelerate in the second half. The best indicator -- 2 indicators. That's what we see other markets, other industries than China in general is an economy say in and trending towards but also we see it quite clearly in our pipeline. Our pipelines are strongly accelerating in China. Hope I answered your question. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: You did. And I asked it in 4 parts. So Gio, just a little more color on free cash flow. Obviously, much better than your initial expectations for Q1. We know it's one of our tops focus if not your top focus this year. So you didn't raise the guide as you said. Is that just sort of prudent, and what have you really changed so far this year about collecting cash? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes. Multifaceted question. I'll ask also David to chip in at a certain stage. But I would say that when we look at Q1 is really a combination of a better AOP, better profit certainly helped, and the are kind of our payments, advanced payments that helped. We know that we have work to do on the trade working capital and we are focusing on that. \n For us, that means concentrating especially on inventory and for us, industry -- inventory reduction and inventory optimization means working intensely on supplier lead time reduction, execution in everything that is a size of material planning, material management production planning. Vendor management in general, we are activating a lot of vendor-managed inventory agreements, all things that will go in the direction of shortening the cycle. \n As the cycle shortens our inventory go down, I was talking about supply chain resiliency, that's a big element. Supply performance is a big element because we can reduce our safety stock without impacting our service level, et cetera. So it's a system. It's an array of actions. And I think that touched upon the most important. David, anything else to add? Of course, it's not just inventory. There are many facets. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. I think the important thing Gio mentioned, the beat in the first quarter was driven by higher profitability and the advanced payments. The advanced payments were super focused on that. But that's a matter of timing. We have to prove that execution over and over as we get through the year or it will just be accelerating cash we would have seen later in the year into the first quarter. So we'll have a better update in 3 months from now. And at this point, we're still very comfortable with that $300 million to $400 million guide. \nOperator: Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: Maybe we could just start with the Americas. Obviously, like the biggest source of the beat and really, really impressive growth this quarter. Can you just talk maybe about how you see that phasing throughout the rest of the year because I expect that 60% plus organic growth probably isn't sustainable. \nGiordano Albertazzi: I would say that we have been able to overperform in the Americas, we were talking about, of course, 60%. If you think about the -- what the details David gave us with a 48% volume. So you think about almost 50% volume is certainly a reflection of a much more reliable supply chain. Absolutely not perfect yet, as I was saying. But very, very importantly, in availability of capacity that we did not have before. So we have more capacity now than we had in the past and certainly a lot more capacity to serve an industry that needs capacity. \n We, in the Americas have done -- we have approached the improvements in the Americas at many, many angles, alignment, talent, leadership capacity processes, fixed supply chain, a lot of price, price, price, but we continue to have a strong backlog also in the Americas.\n Now comparatives will be a little bit more challenging, but we continue to see growth for the rest of the year. So the strength of the first quarter was not a fluke. It was simply, okay, let's say, simply a reflection of all the hard work and the investment and the transformation of a business and a culture towards a strength that we did not certainly have a year ago. \nNicole DeBlase: Got it. So maybe it's fair to say that if you guys are making the claim not for the whole business, there's less seasonality this year. And revenue can be kind of stable throughout the year versus what you reported in 1Q, that comment may also apply to the Americas. Is that a fair characterization? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Very much so. Very much so. And our business -- norma business, is there is such a thing as kind of a pre-COVID normal, would have shown always kind of a very steep second half towards last quarter type of seasonality, it will be much flatter here across the year, in particular for the Americas. I don't know, David, anything you want to add? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. And Nicole, just to help with your modeling. You have all the components to look at first half, second half. We definitely -- we see -- still see a $250 million, $300 million increase in sales in the second half versus first half. We do anticipate more uniformity than in prior years. If you look at it from a regional perspective, most of the lift that you'll see in the second half will come from APAC and the Americas and EMEA would be relatively uniform. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, with all of the news about potential credit crunch, can you guys just talk about how concerned you are about a tighter financing environment potentially impacting project activity in the data center space. \nGiordano Albertazzi: In this moment, again, the thing that we keep an eye on is really what customers or our customer's customers tell us what we see in the pipeline. It's hard to -- it's hard for us to speculate on the consequences of the consequences. It's hard to say -- what we think is that the biggest portion of our market, say, everything related to hyperscale but not only colocation, seem not to be extremely bothered by this at this stage. \nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Davis from Melius Research. \nScott Davis: Good to see your stock price up. But let's -- if you don't mind, Gio, I'd love to go back to AI and -- because this is also new to so many of us and the materiality of the comments is always hard to really get our arms around. But when you think about the faster -- the heat -- the thermal management, the faster speed switches and all the stuff that might be necessary. Is -- are your orders just for a different mix or a higher end mix of new or are you talking about retrofit and there's some demand there to go back into existing data centers and upgrade perhaps at a faster clip than you'd anticipated prior. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Hello, first of all, Scott, thank you for the question. I say you quite an insightful question. In a sense that in this moment, it's predominantly a new infrastructure conversation. But I -- as CEO, Vertiv as a whole, we're extremely intrigued by the opportunities out there because there is a lot of large data center stock, of course. And thinking that all the high density will be brand new into an existing data center infrastructure, which certainly happened. \n But it's solely happening in that dimension. No. We believe that the opportunity for retrofit will be there, a bit premature, I must say. But one thing I'm sure we are extremely well positioned there, a, because in the existing stock of data center globally, we have a big installed base. So no one better than current vendor can help you transition to the new technology, but also again, because if you think about our global presence of service domain knowledge. \n And one thing that is interesting, as I alluded to, probably a little bit too rapidly in -- when we're going through the slides is that, when I talk to them, to our customers, rarely do they think binary in terms, oh it's all AI, oh, it's all -- the new infrastructure is all very high density. The most think about an infrastructure that needs to be resilient over time and enable a transition of technology they probably last 10 years. So this mix and change of mix is very -- it's very intriguing. It's very interesting and very promising tool for us [indiscernible]. \nScott Davis: And Gio, just [indiscernible] \nDavid Fallon: [Indiscernible] \nScott Davis: I'm sorry. Go Ahead. Were you going to jump in there, David? Or -- I'm sorry, guys, you must have bad connection. But let me -- I just -- I hate to ask a question. I think I know the answer, and it may be stupid. But when you think -- when you talk about an order that's coming in, in a facility that needs to manage the power density of AI, are you talking about a larger bill of goods or with a higher margin mix or kind of help us understand and what magnitude is it? Is it 10% more intensity of Vertiv products? Is it double? Is there some sort of way to think about TAM as it relates to what may happen here and the changes necessary to accommodate AI? \nGiordano Albertazzi: I would say the investment is not marginal in terms of portion of infrastructure. And I would say that the total accessible market is not -- certainly not shrinking, certainly not shrinking, if anything, expanding because, again, you have to think system and not just individual piece of technology more in the future than today. And we can think system. \nOperator: Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.. \nNigel Coe: So we've had a pretty decent competition about AI. So I want to switch to the more prosaic enterprise market now. I mean we've seen some negative data points on enterprise IT spending. So just curious, recognizing the fact that your outlook hasn't changed by end market. But on balance, are you seeing a more cautious enterprise customer out there maybe just brief up to speed in terms of where we are on that migration path from on-prem to cloud. \nGiordano Albertazzi: The migration plan from on -- and Nigel, first of all, the migration is continuing, but it's -- again, it's not from 100% on-prem, 100% cloud. I'd say that there are elements of stabilization. Clearly, migration continues. We see the enterprise business growing at single digit in this moment. More or less, that's what we see also through our channel business that, by the way, is in a good health right now. So -- and think about enterprise business also as not just data center, but we see also enterprise demand on the commercial and industrial part of the business as a consequence of trends like near shoring. So we see good level of activity there. \nNigel Coe: Okay. So it doesn't sound like you've seen any deterioration there. Okay. And then maybe just to talk about the pipeline. You talked about a very encouraging pipeline, especially in China in the second half of the year. But when you think about the visibility and your confidence in future backlog growth, would you say that the Americas are still a place where you feel more confident in the outlook? \nGiordano Albertazzi: More confident than other places or you're asking... \nNigel Coe: Your pipeline is stronger -- yes, where do see the most vibrant pipeline. \nGiordano Albertazzi: I would say that clearly, the size of the pipeline is different in different regions, reflecting the markets that we serve. We see pipeline particularly [ vacant ] if you will, in China and in Asia. And we see good level of pipeline supporting our plans in the other parts of [Indiscernible] in Europe and in EMEA and in the Americas. So I'd say that I am positively encouraged. I'm encouraged by the size of the pipeline and by the speed at which we are creating new pipeline. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: Yes. Congratulations on the good results. I had one on the pricing outlook for 2023. So you're now expecting a bit higher pricing than you assumed as of last quarter and you're doing it with less volume. So can you see a little bit more on where the pricing is coming from and what's leading to the higher price for 2023? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Mark. So you're right. We took our full year pricing guide up from $275 million to $300 million. We hit the number in Q1, but there's always a little bit of art as it relates to defining what pricing is. And when we look at our backlog and run the numbers versus last year, they're coming up higher. And we continue to be successful with our new pricing. I think the incremental $25 million came from a recalculation of the carryover, but the big thing with the pricing is it's not turning the other way. So the pricing in the market certainly in the Americas and EMEA, it's sticking, and we're continue to be out there, and we think we're kind of at the right price point, but we'll continue to push it a little bit. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Management. \nJeffrey Sprague: Just wanted to -- if I'm going to do one, maybe just go to free cash flow. David, you pointed out maybe people were a little too nervous about your leverage. But I did want to just get to the point of conversion. Your free cash flow, the EBITDA is about 40% or so. A lot of companies in my group kind of operate in the 60% range or so. So how do we kind of get that conversion relative to your EBITDA higher? Are there any things in particular that need to happen? I think working capital is probably a big chunk of it, but maybe you could bridge us to potential improvement in the out years on that metric. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. We talked about this a little bit on the first quarter call. Our long-term goal, of course, every industrials get to 100. That's very dependent upon growth because trade working capital is the biggest drag. So I think if you look at the metric based on 2023, and you have to look at adjusted net income, it's probably 75%. The 2 biggest drags versus getting to 100 is working capital. And then also, we're over investing this year with CapEx. So our depreciation, if you include software amortization is probably close to $90 million, $95 million, but we have $140 million of CapEx a lot of that, which is supporting additional capacity. \n So in the long run, that has to stabilize just mathematically. So that will probably close maybe a little less than half of that gap. But in the long run, your point is absolutely right on. It has to be work -- with working capital. And we made some progress here in the first quarter, and we project that, that will continue to make progress over the rest of the year. But in the long run, to hit that target, we're going to have to continue to optimize inventory and balance out AR and AP. \nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess my question is really on the backlog side. The $4.8 billion backlog, I'd love to understand how do you think that looks into year-end? Just trying to get a sense of how much of the growth do you think this year is going to come from backlog conversion versus not? And anything you would call out in terms of cancellations, something would be really helpful. And then separately, Gio, I'm hoping you could talk a little bit on this AI dynamic. A lot of the hyperscale companies, I think, at this point are debating if they want to do 100% immersion liquid cooling or hybrid cooling. Do you think your value proposition is as attractive in the immersion liquid cooling market as it's on the hybrid side? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, many questions in one. So -- thank you, Amit. So first of all, backlog. Clearly, $4.8 million (sic) [ $4.8 billion ] is a good number as we were seeing at the beginning. But let's go back to February, when we're saying we are entering 2022 with more than 70% backlog coverage, and that's not \"normal.\" We still believe that is the case. I mean if you go back to whatever the normal would be, we would be probably on a 50% or below 50% backlog coverage. So I'd like to think in terms of percent, not necessarily absolute number. So probably when we go into 2024, we will be more on -- we will be -- most likely we will be in a lower coverage than the 70% we saw last year.\n Now it's a little bit premature really to say how everything will pan out. But think in terms of a lower backlog coverage going forward. Again, that's normal. We talked about lead times. We talked about the reduction of lead time and with the reduction of lead time and the levels of backlog coverage that we had at the beginning of 2023 are incompatible. So simply, the industry will adjust again. \n Clearly, a lot of the revenue in 2023 comes from backlog conversion, but that's just in the math, in the numbers. But you're talking about cancellations. Nothing out of the ordinary. \n And let me talk about cooling technology. As I was saying earlier, it will be a hybrid world from a cooling technology standpoint and the degree of the mix between traditional and liquid will probably change over time very, very small percent of liquid at the beginning and then increasing in the next years, I would say, certainly not months, years.\n You're talking about immersion cooling, immersion cooling is just one of the liquid cooling technologies. There are a lot of our technologies that in this moment, are competing in a technology landscape that is not mature yet. And we are working with some of the biggest hyperscalers and some of the biggest chip manufacturers to really make sure that we align our technology to their evolution and we make sure that we enable their scaling, their solutions out in the market. \nOperator: Next question is from Lance Vitanza from TD Cowen. \nLance Vitanza: Nice job on the quarter. My question is with respect to E&I, as the supply chain has continued to improve, is E&I a drag still? Or has it become a tailwind in the first quarter results? And how do you see that playing out? And then related to that, strategically, are there any other potential acquisitions out there, perhaps tuck-ins that would allow Vertiv to further improve the scope of its product offering and its competitive positioning versus some of the other larger players? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We are happy with the progress on the E&I side of the business. I think it was February, when I was talking about making sure that we accelerate integration, we have taken steps in that direction. In particular, we are embedding the American part of the E&I organization in the bigger Americas business also operationally, so we're satisfied with the progress there. \n When it comes to portfolio management, in general, it will be anyway premature, but be sure -- rest assured that this is something we keep a keen eye on and it's a part of our management cadence and processes. We certainly are constantly looking at opportunities out there. Sometimes they are mature, sometimes they are not mature, but that's part of what we do. \nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Baumann from JPMorgan. \nPatrick Baumann: David, maybe a quick one for you. The free cash flow in the quarter, I think you said there was an advanced payment benefit. Maybe that's reflected as deferred revenue, I don't know, in the cash flow statement. It sounds like this could be timing related based on some of your comments. So it would be helpful to get a sense on second quarter expecting -- second quarter expectations for free cash flow. It's not something that you gave on the slides, but you typically give kind of the forward quarter outlook. \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So first of all, advanced payment could the timing if we do not execute and we have every intention and plan to execute. So you're absolutely right. In the balance sheet, it hits deferred revenue. And we have programs in place, notably in Americas to continue that program with larger orders. And it's something that we have embedded in the process. So we're very optimistic that, that will continue. But to embed that into the guidance, we're going to wait for three months another quarter to kind of reassess that.\n As it relates to individual quarterly guidance for free cash flow, I think historically, we have not provided that we did last year. We are not doing that just because of the lumpiness and some of the variability around free cash flow for individual quarters. As we mentioned in the past, we have $40 million to $50 million check runs that could go out one day versus the next and swing a quarter. So I wouldn't read much into that. We're still very confident with the free cash flow program. We do anticipate it to sequentially increase as we move through the year, and we'll reassess that guidance as we get to the end of the second quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. This is all the questions we have time for today. So I'd like to hand back to Giordano Albertazzi for any closing remarks. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you very much, and thank you for your questions. We are starting off the year with a strong quarter. We certainly intend to continue to build on that momentum as we make our way through 2023. So we definitely look forward to discussing our progress with you. Appreciate your support. And don't forget, looking forward to seeing you on the 29th of November. So with that, thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a lovely day.",

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Perfect. Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter financial results. As you can see, we exceeded the high end of guidance for all metrics on this slide, starting with sales, which were up organically $405 million or 35% from last year's first quarter. $105 million of this increase was from pricing and $300 million from volume, which was up approximately $100 million versus what we assumed in guidance. \n A vast majority of this volume increase was based in the Americas as we continue to see significant improvements in supply chain and manufacturing efficiency and the 2 are related in that region. And it all starts with, and it's supported by a sound SIOP process. \n Adjusted operating profit of $176 million was $163 million higher than last year's first quarter. and $41 million higher than the top end of guidance, and this was primarily due to volume leverage and a higher contribution margin percentage driven by the improved manufacturing efficiency in our North American plants as once again, supply chain issues continue to be addressed and process improvements take hold. \n Of note at the very bottom of the second gray box at the bottom of this page, we recognized a $13 million charge for restructuring in the quarter, and you can see that on the face of our income statement. \n In the spirit of winning now and winning later, while we continuously invest in productivity and efficiency projects, we will overdrive these investments when opportunities present themselves. -- well, in the first quarter, an $8 million onetime gain related to the reversal of an indemnification claim pursuant to the Emerson carve-out provided that opportunity. Instead of dropping this gain to the bottom line, we accelerated restructuring projects costing $13 million, which should drive $20 million of annualized savings, some of which should benefit the later part of 2023. Once again, winning now and winning later. \n Moving to the right on this slide, adjusted free cash flow of $25 million was $175 million higher than last year and $100 million better than the midpoint of guidance. Improvement versus both last year and guidance was driven by higher adjusted operating profit, and significant progress in driving advanced payments from customers. As Gio mentioned, while there is still work to do across all trade working capital categories, we are pleased with the results for the first quarter, and we anticipate continued improvement going forward. \n Finally, on this slide, if you look at the bottom right-hand corner of that last box, we exited the first quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of approximately 4.3x and that was down from 5.5x at year-end. While net debt did not significantly change our trailing 12-month adjusted operating profit increased approximately $163 million from year-end as the $13 million from the first quarter of last year was replaced by the $176 million this year. \n As we reminded folks in February, although mechanical leverage calculations might have wrote and one could say maybe even lazily classified us as higher leverage. We do not believe that was consistent with the underlying reality but more a product of timing in our challenged first half of 2022. Based upon our updated guidance, we expect to be between 3.5 and 4x after the second quarter and approximately 3x at year-end, which is at the top end of our 2 to 3x long-term target range. \n Next, turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. The Americas region had year-over-year organic sales growth of 61%, and that's not a typo. -- including volume of 48% and pricing of 13%. Americas entered the year with a very strong backlog and with improvements in the SIOP process and the supply chain, coupled with the continued capacity ramp-up in our new thermal facility in Monterrey, we were able to drive significant top line volume growth. \n EMEA also benefiting from a strong backlog, posted organic growth of 26%, including 17% from volume and 9% from pricing. APAC is somewhat an outlier compared to the other 2 regions for the first quarter. While we had good growth in India and Southeast Asia, China continued to be impacted by the effects of the post-COVID recovery and related project pushouts to the second quarter and back half of the year. \n Based upon our visibility to an improving pipeline driven by the anticipated macroeconomic recovery and government-sponsored actions that should benefit data centers, we remain optimistic, anticipating mid- to upper single-digit organic growth in APAC for 2023 and good momentum heading into 2024. \n At the bottom of the slide, Americas continued its momentum from the second half of 2022 with adjusted operating margin of 22.1%, 11.3 percentage points higher than last year's first quarter and 160 basis points better than the fourth quarter. About half of the improvement was driven by higher variable contribution margin, including a significant price cost benefit with the other half from fixed cost leverage as we continue to drive our fixed cost constant philosophy while investing in capacity and technology. \n EMEA adjusted operating margin also improved nicely from last year's first quarter by over 700 basis points with about half of that improvement from fixed cost leverage. Finally, APAC, their adjusted operating margin, like its top line remained relatively flat from last year.\n Turning to Page 9. This slide summarizes our second quarter guidance. As we mentioned in our press release, due to our strong beginning of the year backlog and an improved supply chain, we anticipate quarterly seasonality to look a bit different in 2023 compared with historic patterns. As a result, we are not projecting as a significant incremental jump in top line from the first quarter to the second quarter, like prior years, and we should see a more uniform quarterly sales pattern, albeit increasing as we sequentially move through 2023. \n For the second quarter, we anticipate organic sales growth of 15%, with 9% from volume and 6% from pricing. We are projecting adjusted operating profit of $190 million at the midpoint, with pricing, volume and productivity benefits partially offset by inflation and growth investments with the resulting adjusted operating margin up 600 basis points from prior year. We have not provided adjusted free cash flow guidance for the second quarter, but we expect positive cash flow in each of the remaining quarters with sequential increases, and we reiterate our full year guidance on the next slide, which is a good segue. \n Moving to the next slide, Slide 10, where we summarize our full year guidance. We have raised our -- as Gio mentioned, we have raised our 2023 adjusted operating profit guidance by $25 million at the midpoint, building on our strong first quarter performance. Although we experienced favorable supply chain dynamics in the first quarter, there remains uncertainty in certain pockets of our procurement, including notably power semiconductors. So we are approaching volume estimates for the rest of the year with caution. This may be perceived as conservatism, but we believe it is the prudent approach at this point based upon the supply chain volatility we have all seen in the last 18 months, as we know, things can change quickly. \n We are guiding full year adjusted operating margin of 12.3% as we continue our progress towards an anticipated 16% in the intermediate term and 20% in the long term. And as I mentioned, we are reiterating our adjusted free cash flow guidance for the full year of $350 million at the midpoint. \n With that said, I turn it back over to Gio. Yes. I think the important thing Gio mentioned, the beat in the first quarter was driven by higher profitability and the advanced payments. The advanced payments were super focused on that. But that's a matter of timing. We have to prove that execution over and over as we get through the year or it will just be accelerating cash we would have seen later in the year into the first quarter. So we'll have a better update in 3 months from now. And at this point, we're still very comfortable with that $300 million to $400 million guide. Yes. And Nicole, just to help with your modeling. You have all the components to look at first half, second half. We definitely -- we see -- still see a $250 million, $300 million increase in sales in the second half versus first half. We do anticipate more uniformity than in prior years. If you look at it from a regional perspective, most of the lift that you'll see in the second half will come from APAC and the Americas and EMEA would be relatively uniform. [Indiscernible] Yes. Thanks, Mark. So you're right. We took our full year pricing guide up from $275 million to $300 million. We hit the number in Q1, but there's always a little bit of art as it relates to defining what pricing is. And when we look at our backlog and run the numbers versus last year, they're coming up higher. And we continue to be successful with our new pricing. I think the incremental $25 million came from a recalculation of the carryover, but the big thing with the pricing is it's not turning the other way. So the pricing in the market certainly in the Americas and EMEA, it's sticking, and we're continue to be out there, and we think we're kind of at the right price point, but we'll continue to push it a little bit. Yes. We talked about this a little bit on the first quarter call. Our long-term goal, of course, every industrials get to 100. That's very dependent upon growth because trade working capital is the biggest drag. So I think if you look at the metric based on 2023, and you have to look at adjusted net income, it's probably 75%. The 2 biggest drags versus getting to 100 is working capital. And then also, we're over investing this year with CapEx. So our depreciation, if you include software amortization is probably close to $90 million, $95 million, but we have $140 million of CapEx a lot of that, which is supporting additional capacity. \n So in the long run, that has to stabilize just mathematically. So that will probably close maybe a little less than half of that gap. But in the long run, your point is absolutely right on. It has to be work -- with working capital. And we made some progress here in the first quarter, and we project that, that will continue to make progress over the rest of the year. But in the long run, to hit that target, we're going to have to continue to optimize inventory and balance out AR and AP. Yes.

            "name": "Giordano Albertazzi",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Thank you very much, and good day, everyone. So we delivered a very strong first quarter sales, up 35% organically, led by Americas, up over 60% and EMEA, up 25%. We were able to ship more in Q1 than a typical first quarter as we strengthened our supply chain and increase capacity across the world, in particular, in our Monterrey thermal management facility. \n We had very high backlog starting the year, and we have the capacity to serve the growing demand of the industry. Orders excluding FX, were down 23% from last year's first quarter. This was in line with our expectations, driven by the comparison with an exceptionally high Q1 '22 and consistent with the orders normalization trend we referred to in February. Book-to-bill ratio was 1x and backlog remained flat versus year-end '22, our historical peak. I will further elaborate on this when we review Slide 6. \n Our adjusted operating profit was $176 million, which was $41 million higher than the top end of our guidance. The beat was largely driven by additional volume and higher-than-expected variable contribution margin coming from a combination of manufacturing efficiency and supply chain efficiency. We are raising our full year adjusted operating profit guidance by $25 million at the midpoint, given the strong first quarter results. \n Adjusted free cash flow was another good story with $25 million cash generation in the quarter, $100 million higher than our guidance. Although we're pleased with our first quarter performance, we know very well there is still work to do. We are holding the adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year at $350 million, i.e., the previous midpoint, but we understand there is ample opportunity for improvement and certainly in inventory. \n We are continuing to strengthen our processes and operational rigor around trade working capital execution. So overall, a good start, and we are squarely focused on delivering the full year, and that is one quarter at a time. \n And let us turn to Slide 4. We have no changes to the view on the market from 2 months ago at the end of February. We are cognizant of the headlines around tech and the general uncertainty around macro environment, we continue to see encouraging pipeline activity. Some cloud hyperscale customers are digesting capacity. Others are using this as an opportunity to accelerate their build-outs. Some hyperscalers are moderating CapEx growth, that this moderate growth is still healthy growth. And we see investment continuing. \n Additionally, we see some market reacceleration in the second half of the year, especially in China, which has been softer over the last several quarters. As Dave mentioned, there is significant secular growth story in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the acceleration of everything artificial intelligence in the tech space. We are distinctly seeing the first signs of the AI investment cycle in our pipelines and orders. Vertiv is uniquely positioned to win here given our market leadership and deep domain expertise in areas like thermal management and controls, which are vital to support the complexity of future AI infrastructures. \n Let's move to Slide 5. First and most importantly, markets are, in general, healthy. Investment continues across markets, hyperscale, colos, enterprise. Our project pipeline remains strong. We review pipeline activity regularly and diligently, and pipeline activity remains encouraging. First quarter orders, including the impact of foreign exchange, declined 23%. There are order dynamics that are important to unfold. So we have provided additional details in the next slide. More comments then. \n Let me go back to the investments in AI. You may have heard it as generally characterized as the next infrastructure arms race, Vertiv benefits from this race and is an agnostic partner of choice to the risk participants. The acceleration in investment in AI will turn into a net infrastructure capacity demand acceleration, and this starts to be visible in our pipelines. AI applications demand a net capacity increase in the industry, higher power density, a gradual migration to an air and liquid hybrid cooling environment and a transition to liquid-ready facility designed. \n I do not believe there is anyone else in the data center infrastructure space as well positioned as Vertiv even our expertise broaden technology portfolio, infrastructure system view and advanced control systems. \n Already today, some AI infrastructure orders are in our backlog, and we are encouraged by the potential that AI represents for Vertiv. So supply chain, it is incrementally better. There are still pockets of tightness in electronics, but the relentless qualification of additional suppliers we have driven in the last 12 months is helping us a lot. \n Inflation. We anticipate metal cost at lower levels in '23 versus '22, although they are starting to trend upwards, a more favorable environment on freight, reduced spot buy activity that both trending back to historic levels and that are good offset. I also like to remind that we have built up a robust pricing process that helps us in case of enduring inflation. Any overall price cost is developing according to plan and consistent with expectations. \n Let's now move to Slide 6. Let me here elaborate on future Q1 orders, order normalization and lead times. Indeed, last year's Q1 poses an exceptionally challenging comparison with orders up 34% from the first quarter of 2021. We will see some quarter-to-quarter variation due to timing of large projects, but last year's first quarter was exceptionally in that sense. We believe order normalization is very real. We talked about this in February 2022. \n In February. In 2022, the large hyperscale and colocation customers were giving us orders that covered their requirements for extended period. As I mentioned, some going out 18-plus months due to the challenging supply chain and lead time situation in the industry. They wanted to secure the capacity they needed long term. That behavior was particularly pronounced in our thermal line of business. \n Now that our lead times are improving, not yet where we want them to be, but much better than last year. We anticipate they will continue to improve going forward. \n Now that our lead times are improving, I would say, customers are more comfortable releasing orders at a much more normal cadence. This creates short-term air pocket but does not impact the volume or timing of what we will ultimately ship to customers. Order patterns are just normalizing. This is healthy for our business and the industry. So what does that leave us? We are encouraged that our book-to-bill ratio is 1x. And our backlog remains at the same level we had at the end of 2022, even with an extremely strong shipment quarter in Q1 where organic sales were increased 35%. Worth signaling an approximately 12% 3-year order CAGR that reflects good end market demand. \n We believe that Q1 2023 will remain the most unfavorable year-over-year quarterly comparison in 2023, we believe it improves from here. We still anticipate a reduction in Q2 23 orders versus prior year, but improving relative to Q1. It is hard to have a crystal ball into second half of 2023. But with what I hear from customers, including what seems to be forming into a substantial investment cycle for AI. I remain optimistic that year-over-year orders will turn positive when we get to later quarters. \n Having said that, I'll pass it over to David, who will walk us through the financials. Over to you, David. Well, thank you, David. Let us then turn to Slide 11, and let's summarize the key takeaways. So a very good first quarter. Momentum is continuing. Market remains healthy, and we benefit from having a large backlog and a better supply chain and more capacity. We are raising our AOP guidance given a good Q1 performance. \n I am very pleased to announce Vertiv will be hosting its first Investor Conference on November 29 at the New York Stock Exchange. More details certainly to come, but already now, hope your pencil is down your calendars, and we hope you will be able to join us. \n As Dave, Dave Cote is known for saying, \"The trick is in the doing and we are getting after the doing.\" And that means a strong execution, supported by a high-performing team and culture, make sure there are no shortcuts, no magic wands, the doing is clarity of vision, alignment and relentless focus on improvement and execution. \n I am very proud of the staff [indiscernible] we continue to take as an organization, and I want to thank the entire Vertiv team for the ever-increasing focus and passion and execution. We are still in the early stages of our acceleration. And after my first quarter as a CEO, I'm more optimistic than ever about our path ahead. \n With that, we will now turn the call over to the operator who will open the line for questions for us. Thank you very much. Okay. Well, thank you for your question, Andy. I would say that many elements for this confidence. One is what we see in the pipelines and pipelines are moving, we are definitely pleased by our book-to-bill ratio at 1, as we were saying, especially given the overage in sales relative to Q1 guidance. But as we said, the -- especially the hyperscalers and not stopping their investment. \n We also heard some prominent hyperscalers in the last few days, sending messages about their infrastructure spend. So there is positivity in the year. And again, that resounds with our -- with what we see in the pipeline. \n Now we talked last time about normalization, and that's what we continue to see. So do not be surprised when we will see still the second quarter that on a competitive basis will be down year-on-year, but up in absolute terms versus Q1 as we were saying. But again, there is movement out there. There is a positivity. \n Now not all the hyperscalers are exactly in the same place or all the colos are in the same place, but many of the large ones are -- continues to plan capacity expansion. It is difficult to your point about AI. It's difficult to really draw a line between AI investment, enabling investment and other investments. I would say that the line is blurring. One would think that AI is a totally new thing. Certainly, generative AI is accelerating very rapidly. But there are elements in AI and everything we do today already. So if anything, we see an acceleration not a sharp transition to something completely new. \n But we see AI in terms of the type of conversations and specifications that we see coming our way. And again, as I was saying, when going through the slides, a lot about power density, and a lot about bigger capacity investments, kind of bigger chunks and that's encouraging. \n So again, AI as a transition and I invite everyone to think AI more in terms of a transition towards a higher density, higher density compute and high-density power as a consequence. \n You were asking about China. We believe China will reaccelerate in the second half. The best indicator -- 2 indicators. That's what we see other markets, other industries than China in general is an economy say in and trending towards but also we see it quite clearly in our pipeline. Our pipelines are strongly accelerating in China. Hope I answered your question. Yes. Multifaceted question. I'll ask also David to chip in at a certain stage. But I would say that when we look at Q1 is really a combination of a better AOP, better profit certainly helped, and the are kind of our payments, advanced payments that helped. We know that we have work to do on the trade working capital and we are focusing on that. \n For us, that means concentrating especially on inventory and for us, industry -- inventory reduction and inventory optimization means working intensely on supplier lead time reduction, execution in everything that is a size of material planning, material management production planning. Vendor management in general, we are activating a lot of vendor-managed inventory agreements, all things that will go in the direction of shortening the cycle. \n As the cycle shortens our inventory go down, I was talking about supply chain resiliency, that's a big element. Supply performance is a big element because we can reduce our safety stock without impacting our service level, et cetera. So it's a system. It's an array of actions. And I think that touched upon the most important. David, anything else to add? Of course, it's not just inventory. There are many facets. I would say that we have been able to overperform in the Americas, we were talking about, of course, 60%. If you think about the -- what the details David gave us with a 48% volume. So you think about almost 50% volume is certainly a reflection of a much more reliable supply chain. Absolutely not perfect yet, as I was saying. But very, very importantly, in availability of capacity that we did not have before. So we have more capacity now than we had in the past and certainly a lot more capacity to serve an industry that needs capacity. \n We, in the Americas have done -- we have approached the improvements in the Americas at many, many angles, alignment, talent, leadership capacity processes, fixed supply chain, a lot of price, price, price, but we continue to have a strong backlog also in the Americas.\n Now comparatives will be a little bit more challenging, but we continue to see growth for the rest of the year. So the strength of the first quarter was not a fluke. It was simply, okay, let's say, simply a reflection of all the hard work and the investment and the transformation of a business and a culture towards a strength that we did not certainly have a year ago. Very much so. Very much so. And our business -- norma business, is there is such a thing as kind of a pre-COVID normal, would have shown always kind of a very steep second half towards last quarter type of seasonality, it will be much flatter here across the year, in particular for the Americas. I don't know, David, anything you want to add? In this moment, again, the thing that we keep an eye on is really what customers or our customer's customers tell us what we see in the pipeline. It's hard to -- it's hard for us to speculate on the consequences of the consequences. It's hard to say -- what we think is that the biggest portion of our market, say, everything related to hyperscale but not only colocation, seem not to be extremely bothered by this at this stage. Hello, first of all, Scott, thank you for the question. I say you quite an insightful question. In a sense that in this moment, it's predominantly a new infrastructure conversation. But I -- as CEO, Vertiv as a whole, we're extremely intrigued by the opportunities out there because there is a lot of large data center stock, of course. And thinking that all the high density will be brand new into an existing data center infrastructure, which certainly happened. \n But it's solely happening in that dimension. No. We believe that the opportunity for retrofit will be there, a bit premature, I must say. But one thing I'm sure we are extremely well positioned there, a, because in the existing stock of data center globally, we have a big installed base. So no one better than current vendor can help you transition to the new technology, but also again, because if you think about our global presence of service domain knowledge. \n And one thing that is interesting, as I alluded to, probably a little bit too rapidly in -- when we're going through the slides is that, when I talk to them, to our customers, rarely do they think binary in terms, oh it's all AI, oh, it's all -- the new infrastructure is all very high density. The most think about an infrastructure that needs to be resilient over time and enable a transition of technology they probably last 10 years. So this mix and change of mix is very -- it's very intriguing. It's very interesting and very promising tool for us [indiscernible]. I would say the investment is not marginal in terms of portion of infrastructure. And I would say that the total accessible market is not -- certainly not shrinking, certainly not shrinking, if anything, expanding because, again, you have to think system and not just individual piece of technology more in the future than today. And we can think system. The migration plan from on -- and Nigel, first of all, the migration is continuing, but it's -- again, it's not from 100% on-prem, 100% cloud. I'd say that there are elements of stabilization. Clearly, migration continues. We see the enterprise business growing at single digit in this moment. More or less, that's what we see also through our channel business that, by the way, is in a good health right now. So -- and think about enterprise business also as not just data center, but we see also enterprise demand on the commercial and industrial part of the business as a consequence of trends like near shoring. So we see good level of activity there. More confident than other places or you're asking... I would say that clearly, the size of the pipeline is different in different regions, reflecting the markets that we serve. We see pipeline particularly [ vacant ] if you will, in China and in Asia. And we see good level of pipeline supporting our plans in the other parts of [Indiscernible] in Europe and in EMEA and in the Americas. So I'd say that I am positively encouraged. I'm encouraged by the size of the pipeline and by the speed at which we are creating new pipeline. Well, many questions in one. So -- thank you, Amit. So first of all, backlog. Clearly, $4.8 million (sic) [ $4.8 billion ] is a good number as we were seeing at the beginning. But let's go back to February, when we're saying we are entering 2022 with more than 70% backlog coverage, and that's not \"normal.\" We still believe that is the case. I mean if you go back to whatever the normal would be, we would be probably on a 50% or below 50% backlog coverage. So I'd like to think in terms of percent, not necessarily absolute number. So probably when we go into 2024, we will be more on -- we will be -- most likely we will be in a lower coverage than the 70% we saw last year.\n Now it's a little bit premature really to say how everything will pan out. But think in terms of a lower backlog coverage going forward. Again, that's normal. We talked about lead times. We talked about the reduction of lead time and with the reduction of lead time and the levels of backlog coverage that we had at the beginning of 2023 are incompatible. So simply, the industry will adjust again. \n Clearly, a lot of the revenue in 2023 comes from backlog conversion, but that's just in the math, in the numbers. But you're talking about cancellations. Nothing out of the ordinary. \n And let me talk about cooling technology. As I was saying earlier, it will be a hybrid world from a cooling technology standpoint and the degree of the mix between traditional and liquid will probably change over time very, very small percent of liquid at the beginning and then increasing in the next years, I would say, certainly not months, years.\n You're talking about immersion cooling, immersion cooling is just one of the liquid cooling technologies. There are a lot of our technologies that in this moment, are competing in a technology landscape that is not mature yet. And we are working with some of the biggest hyperscalers and some of the biggest chip manufacturers to really make sure that we align our technology to their evolution and we make sure that we enable their scaling, their solutions out in the market. We are happy with the progress on the E&I side of the business. I think it was February, when I was talking about making sure that we accelerate integration, we have taken steps in that direction. In particular, we are embedding the American part of the E&I organization in the bigger Americas business also operationally, so we're satisfied with the progress there. \n When it comes to portfolio management, in general, it will be anyway premature, but be sure -- rest assured that this is something we keep a keen eye on and it's a part of our management cadence and processes. We certainly are constantly looking at opportunities out there. Sometimes they are mature, sometimes they are not mature, but that's part of what we do. Well, thank you very much, and thank you for your questions. We are starting off the year with a strong quarter. We certainly intend to continue to build on that momentum as we make our way through 2023. So we definitely look forward to discussing our progress with you. Appreciate your support. And don't forget, looking forward to seeing you on the 29th of November. So with that, thank you very much."

            "content": "Well, it's one hell of a debut for our new CEO's first quarter isn't it? I am very pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter and our ongoing progress. Gio's first quarter as CEO is under his belt, and his operational focus on delivering results and creating a high-performance culture is particularly noticeable, especially in the Americas. \n We over-delivered in the first quarter compared to guidance and we increased the midpoint of our AOP guidance by $25 million, and cash flow was terrific. We entered the year with a very strong backlog. We were able to secure needed parts and we had capacity in place to deliver a high Q1 sales level.\n Order rates will be another metric that looks different this year. Gio has some detail in his prepared remarks to explain that. We are constantly focused on the orders rate, and we are encouraged both by the pipeline activity and the pace of investment in our end markets. I've said this for a number of years. There is a true secular growth story at Vertiv and the work we have done in positioning the company for growth and being able to leverage that growth in a meaningful way by getting after margin opportunities while still protecting growth investment makes Vertiv uniquely positioned to create substantial value in the years ahead. It is what attracted me to this assets 4 years ago, and I'm even more excited today with the runway ahead. \n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Nadia. Good morning and welcome to Vertiv's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Giordano Albertazzi; and Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon. Today we have a few additional slides to cover in our presentation. We will let the Q&A portion of the call go an additional ten minutes if needed, up until 12:10 p.m. Eastern Time. We would kindly request to please limit yourself to one question, and if you have a follow up question, please rejoin the queue. Before we begin, I would like to point out that during the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote.\nDave Cote: Good morning. Q3 was another very strong quarter across the board on every metrics, sales, income, cash flow and orders. Fourth quarter guidance is strong and sales for 2025 looks stronger still based on wicked good autos [ph] performance. And importantly, there is more goodness ahead as our portfolio expands, new products are introduced and the Vertiv Operating System, or VOS, becomes reality. There are two areas I'd like to address specifically where investors seem to oscillate between fear and excitement. The first is AI reality and the second is liquid cooling. We had the agricultural revolution, then the industrial revolution and now we're only about 40 years into the digital revolution. AI is just the next step in that digital revolution. AI is real, and it has just begun. It's got a long way to go. Data centers are fundamental to all that computing. There is no other alternative even on the horizon. Distributed architecture enhances need for data centers, even quantum computing relies on digital-based data centers. We've enjoyed extremely strong orders in the first half of 2024 and we would agree that continued approximately 60% order increases are unlikely as we tried to say last quarter. By the same token, we are seeing robust backlog building growth supporting orders continue. Cloud and AI reinforce each other and drive the need for a lot of computing. Additionally, the AI ramp-up in countries outside the U.S. is just beginning. This bodes extremely well for Vertiv for a long time as a market leader in data center infrastructure. As the data center infrastructure develops, liquid cooling increasingly comes to the fore and we continue to rapidly gain share. There are various parts to a liquid cooling system and like all our products, we've worked to position ourselves in the high IP and know-how areas, specifically, CDUs and total systems. Here are several charts in this presentation to simplify understanding of a liquid cool system, our position and why we will continue to gain share in this rapidly growing market. Our data center products portfolio is the broadest in the industry. It's also important to note that while rapidly growing, we are not just in liquid cooling. Everything is growing well. We have extensive coverage in thermal systems, power management, IT solutions, modular and services. AI and data center growth in this digital age benefits everything we do, not just liquid cooling. While it's true there is competition in liquid cooling, that's also true of all our markets. We won't win 100% of all orders, but I believe we will continue to gain share because of our technology base and broad portfolio, global scale, deep industry expertise, global service and strong customer relationships. These are distinguishing characteristics that others in the market can't match. Vertiv's role is an important one in the industry. We worked very closely on roadmap consistency with key technology providers to be ready for today and seeing around the corners to what the industry needs to do next. A great example of this is the joint announcement we did last week with NVIDIA, highlighting the co-development partnership for the AI factory of the present and future. The industry needs to be ready for this new era of compute and Vertiv is working closely with our customers, so they will be ready for what is coming. While there is intense focus right now on every aspect of AI and the data center market, I would encourage investors who scare themselves about the AI future or Vertiv's role to instead take a longer-term view of the secular growth story in front of us. There is a multi-decade growth trajectory unfolding. Competition is not a new phenomenon, and we expect there to be competitors in the market as there always have been. Vertiv's advantages though are not easily replicated and we are further expanding them. That is what I saw five years ago as I looked at this unique company, market leadership, global scale, technology differentiation, great end markets and longstanding customer relationships. The foundational elements for value creation were there, but it needed to be unlocked in a convincing way with strong leadership. I credit Gio and his team for doing the hard work to start unlocking the full potential of Vertiv. We are still far from our full potential and that is the most exciting part as I think about what is coming next quarter, next year and for many years ahead. And it is certainly supported by our orders and operational performance. So with that, I will turn the call over to Gio.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you. Thank you, Dave. And we go to Slide 3. This was another strong quarter. Q3 organic sales were up 19% with double-digit growth in all three regions. Orders were a 37% growth on a trailing 12-month basis; meet our expectation, thanks to third quarter up 17% on a year-on-year basis despite tougher comparatives. The demand we see is resilient and this 37% trailing 12 corroborates the ambition for long-term growth. Adjusted operating profit at $417 million beat guidance. 20.1% adjusted operating margin expanded 310 basis points, our first time surpassing the 20% mark, an indication for the potential ahead. Adjusted free cash flow was $336 million in the third quarter and we have generated $773 million year-to-date. Leverage reduced to 1.4x as of the end of Q3, while we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We again raised our full year guidance across all financial metrics and expect organic growth of 14%, adjusted operating profit of $1.485 million and margins expanding to 19%. We also expect adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion, up $125 million from previous guidance. The orders trends and our robust backlog indicate that growth in 2025 will accelerate relative to 2024\u2019s 14%. Let\u2019s go to Slide 4. As said, at 37%, our trailing 12-month order growth remains very convincing. Pipelines continue to grow we saw pipeline increase sequentially from Q3 \u2013 from Q2 to Q3 across all regions. We also are seeing more convincing signals that AI is indeed accelerating in EMEA. We are not providing a view on Q4 orders. Do not read too much into this. Orders are hard to forecast. They can be lumpy, exact timing often outside our control, and it ultimately depends on when the customer is ready to issue a PO. With that said, I\u2019d also like to assure you that we feel good, in fact, quite encouraged, that the order trajectory will remain healthy and support the financial ambition that we are targeting. Our backlog continues to strengthen up to $7.4 billion at the end of Q3, and this supports our view that growth will accelerate from 2024 to 2025. Let\u2019s now look at the right side of Slide 4. We have sharp focus on our capacity. We want to make sure we stay ahead of the demand signals and enable growth. We continue to expand capacity. An example is the recently announced, newly integrated, modular solutions facility in the Americas. This facility has started production and shipments in third quarter and it is helping us meet our customers\u2019 needs for rapid data center capacity deployment. Our focus on supply chain is intense. We see the demand trajectory unfolding for years ahead, and we\u2019re making sure our supply chain is resilient in terms of supplier redundancy and geographic diversity. Inflation will continue. We incorporate that expectation in how we approach our commercial excellence programs. The Vertiv Operating System continues to deliver incremental capacity, productivity gains, reduced lead times, fundamental to our ability to execute at speed and scale. Let\u2019s go to Slide 5 now. We have others a few slides in the presentation to fully describe our position in thermal management and more specifically liquid cooling for data centers. Let\u2019s start broad. Vertiv has the most complete portfolio of critical, digital infrastructure products, solutions and services. Sales are well balanced across the five business groups, power management representing 32% of our business; thermal management 30%; IT systems 10%; infrastructure solutions 5%; and services 23%. The impact of AI is favorable to the entire Vertiv portfolio in terms of total volume and TAM per megawatt. The total vertical opportunity is much larger than just the opportunity in thermal, and we love thermal. It\u2019s very important. So let\u2019s talk about it. And let\u2019s focus on the right side of the chart. We have the entire range of thermal chain technologies from outside the data center building to inside the rack, everything as an example, from a chiller to new rack CDU or/and a manifold. Liquid and air cooling coexist for heat collection in the data center of the future. In all cases, liquid and air cooling, no matter the mix of the two, require heat rejection or heat reuse so chillers, direct expansion, condensers, et cetera. So not air or liquid, air and liquid, and heat rejection for the foreseeable future. Now please focus on the thermal market bars on the very right part of the page. We believe from a market value standpoint that air and heat rejection combined will be 70% of the market and liquid 30% over the next few years. Air and heat rejection will grow at a 10% CAGR and liquid at a 30% CAGR, all growing very nicely. We have serious intentions to be the market leader in liquid cooling. Vertiv's growth in liquid cooling exceeds the market growth, and we believe we are rapidly gaining market share. We see that in our orders, we see orders converting to revenue in a convincing way. This quarter is a strong example. Slide 6. I want to describe what Vertiv leadership in liquid cooling means. Focus please on the left side of the slide. Also portfolio, first and foremost, Vertiv has a complete range of liquid and high density solutions, in particular, in-rack CDUs, 1-phase row CDUs, 2-phase row CDUs, manifolds, rear door heat exchangers, immersion cooling. And we are cold-plate agnostic. And we like that approach as it enables our CDUs to be validated across multiple cold-plate technologies and server brands. We are proud of our portfolio, but there is more to our liquid cooling trend than the strength of our portfolio. It is future readiness. We are working today on the products that enable the technology roadmaps of the most influential silicon providers. Our products must precede theirs in the field. Innovation, we are significantly increasing our investment in high density cooling engineering to continue to lead in the future. Complete thermal chain. The data center of the future will have both air and liquid in a mix that will vary during the life cycle of the data center based on the loads and the IT refresh cycles. So having the ability to master all cooling technology is of the essence. Ability to customize at scale, indeed global scale, we are on track to scale our liquid cooling technology, 45x by the end of this year. We are not stopping there. Service strength. Data center expertise and service footprint are vastly different between players. For Vertiv, we have been servicing data centers for multiple decades. We have about 4,000 service engineers deployed globally and growing. Long-standing customer relationships, they need a partner that has the expertise to understand the significant changes ahead and can deliver clear TCO advantages. Reliability and quality, Vertiv has a reputation earned over several decades of keeping data centers up and running. This is what liquid cooling market leadership looks like. And I'm proud of our position. We are seeing this translating into strong orders and now sales. Let's go to Slide 7, and let's zoom out a bit. Let's look at our partnership with NVIDIA. You may have seen the recent announcements of our co-development of complete power and cooling reference designs for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 platform. We are helping data center operators getting ahead of the challenges and enabling the vision of AI factors. Vertiv's advantages on the prior slide exactly why we are uniquely able to play this important role for the industry and why there is a very organic relationship between NVIDIA and Vertiv. We make sure our technology enables NVIDIA roadmaps today and in the future. A great example of enabling the industry to be future-ready is our truly unique Vertiv CoolPhase CDU, which makes it simple to deploy high density liquid cooling where needed without having to reengineer the entire data center environment, even in the absence of a chilled water loop. Vertiv can seamlessly \u2013 sorry, Vertiv can seamlessly embed in one solution, the ability to navigate the transition between liquid and air cooled service. We can develop these unique solutions because we \u2013 because of our decade-long expertise around these technologies. So with that, over to David.\nDavid Fallon: Perfect. Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. Organic net sales up 19%, $114 million above the midpoint of guidance, with that upside driven by favorable timing of shipments in both the Americas and EMEA. Our backlog is strong. And with available production capacity, we were able to realize these additional sales previously projected for the fourth quarter. Double-digit organic growth was seen across all three regions, with EMEA leading the way at 25% and demonstrating that strength in the data center demand is not only an American story, but it is indeed global. Adjusted operating profit of $417 million was $121 million higher than last year, primarily driven by higher volume and commercial execution. Adjusted operating margin of 20.1% represents a significant milestone, surpassing 20% for the first time. We shared last year in our investor event a long-term ambition of 20% plus. It is safe to assume that the 0.1% above the 20% in the third quarter does not define the upper limit of that plus. We believe there is plenty of upside opportunity and a lot of work to do with margins, and we plan to share our revised long-term ambition in this year's November 18th Investor event. Now back to third quarter margins. We did incur launch costs for our new infrastructure solutions facility in Pelzer in the third quarter as well as at several existing facilities where we are expanding internal capacity and these launch costs as well as some project mix negatively impacted third quarter growth margin compared with the second quarter. Some of these launch costs were one time in nature, but others are permanent and we expect those to be more fully absorbed in gross margin with higher volume going forward. Finally, on this page, our adjusted free cash flow was $336 million, $115 million better than last year, driven by higher profitability and continued improved trade working capital, which declined to 16% of annualized third quarter sales. Now that figure had been consistently above 20% in recent prior years, so some good progress there, but once again, similar to margins, still a ton of opportunity. Our adjusted free cash flow conversion was 116% in the third quarter, the second consecutive quarter over 100%. Now turning to Slide 9, this slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. As mentioned, we saw double-digit sales growth across all three regions. Americas had another strong quarter, organic sales up 21% with broad strength across multiple market verticals and product lines, including a material contribution from liquid cooling in the third quarter. Adjusted operating margin expanded 470 basis points, largely driven by operational leverage and strong commercial execution. APAC sales increased 10% organically, with China growing double-digits. Although we are pleased with this growth in China, which represents about 10% of our overall business, we are not projecting that same double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, maybe out of prudence or conservatism, as China still operates in a challenging macro environment. APAC adjusted operating margin declined 260 basis points from third quarter of 2023, primarily due to unfavorable mix and a favorable discrete item in last year\u2019s third quarter. But APAC operating margins did improve sequentially from the second quarter as expected, and we anticipate further sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter. EMEA organic sales increased 25%, driven by continued strong demand from Colocation and Hyperscale customers, and very encouragingly, growth was broad across our product and services portfolios. Looking forward, as Gio mentioned, visibility into a strong pipeline of AI-related demand in EMEA is becoming clear. Adjusted operating margin expanded 400 basis points to 25.9% and in the quarterly competition with the Americas, EMEA won for the second consecutive quarter. But of course, we anticipate another close race between those two regions as we close out the year. Moving to Slide 10, this slide summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We are expecting a strong close to the year, with fourth quarter sales expected to be up 13% organically, with the regional profile reflecting Americas up high-teens and APAC and EMEA up mid to high-single digits from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $437 million at the midpoint and adjusted operating margin of 20.4% with continued expansion from the third quarter margin driven by operational leverage, commercial execution, and productivity gains. We anticipate year-over-year incremental margins of 39% in the fourth quarter, which translates into a projected 46% incremental margin for the full year. Next, turning to Slide 11, our full year guidance. We are increasing guidance for sales by $140 million, a combination of volume and foreign exchange. Full year expected organic growth is now 14%, with this increase primarily driven by the Americas and EMEA, both expected to post mid-teens growth from 2023. We are increasing our full year adjusted operating profit guidance by $50 million to $1.485 billion with $32 million from the third quarter beat and $18 million from the fourth quarter raise. Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to be 19% at the midpoint, 30 basis points higher than our previous full year guidance and a 370 basis point improvement from 2023. We are certainly pleased but not satisfied with our margin performance in 2024. In November of last year, we initially guided to 16.7% versus the 19% we are currently guiding. The consistent quarterly beaten raise with this metric demonstrates our continued progress with operational leverage, commercial execution and productivity business wide, driven by the Vertiv operating system, and as mentioned, more to come. Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.68 is more than 50% higher than 2023, which translates into a very healthy PEG ratio. The higher earnings per share is primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit. We continue to provide additional information on income taxes and share count in the appendix of this presentation, and we will be more than happy to discuss any details on either of these topics after the call. On the far right side of this slide, we raised our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to $1 billion, an increase of $125 million from prior guidance. This implies fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of approximately $230 million and a projected net leverage at year-end of approximately 1.2 times, providing the needed flexibility to exercise our capital deployment strategy going forward. In conclusion, we believe that a strong fourth quarter exit in 2024 indeed positions us very well for a strong 2025. So with that said, I turn it back over to Gio.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you. Thank you, David. And talking about 2025, let's go to Slide 12. And here are some of the early thoughts. In a nutshell, we are excited about the year ahead. The market is strong and we're certainly feeling the AI tailwinds that should continue to strengthen next year. We have good visibility, we have sharp executional focus and price cost is expected to be positive. This results in our expectation for growth in 2025 to be higher than our growth in 2024 with expected expansion of adjusted operating margins and strong free cash flow generation. Let's go to Slide 13. This is a quick reminder. We have an upcoming investor event in Atlanta, Georgia on Monday, November 18. It is also an opportunity to tour our booth at SC24 the following morning. So we hope we will see you there. Summarize things and go to Slide 14. The data center market is strong and the market is coming towards Vertiv. We are ready for this. Not only are we delivering strong growth, but we are also demonstrating our ability to deliver on profit and cash in a convincing manner. We have raised our full year guidance again and we continue the relentless pursuit for better. There is always room for improvement and that is the mindset we adopt every day. We stay humble and focused the intensity of stepping up. This is the right time to go faster, drive differentiation and deliver premium results. I'm holding the Vertiv team and myself directly accountable to do just that. So with that, over to the operator, Nadia, for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question goes to Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew, please go ahead.\nDavid Ridley Lane: Hi, this is David Ridley Lane on for Andrew. As hyperscalers are starting to build out multilocation campuses, how does the order timing for you work out? Do you receive an order for all the buildings at the campus at a single point in time? Do those get phased in over time, and how is that part of the market developing for you?\nGiordano Albertazzi: First of all, we definitely see this large campuses and large data center deployments happen and happen at really large scale. Not just scale all the buildings, but scale across the market. In general, we get good visibility on the entire program, but the exact way in which POs are placed, if you will, really specific to the individual hyperscaler or even speaking about very large deployment colo, some colos have very large deployment themselves. But again, they have different models. But in general that the prevalent is they place POs for the buildings that are in the project of being deployed at that time. So as we said in a previous call, we get certainly a longer visibility in terms of the PO that we receive from this part of the market. But the good thing is that we have the PO and the PO is needed for them and they are actually building and the visibility on the longer program.\nDavid Ridley Lane: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question goes to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve, please go ahead.\nSteve Tusa: Hey guys, good morning.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Good morning, Steve.\nDavid Fallon: Hi, Steve.\nSteve Tusa: Just a backward looking question on 3Q in the orders, obviously in the second quarter, you beat your guidance by several hundred million dollars, you talked about a couple of things moving in or at least hitting in that quarter that maybe you had less visibility on at the beginning. When you look at the outperformance this quarter, which was fine but a lot more modest. Was there anything that like pushed out on you in the quarter? Did you hit most of what you expected to hit from an orders perspective around timing. And just my follow-up would be, there's a lot of questions around the ODMs who are talking about their market share and liquid cooling. Can you just maybe remind us and clarify how you guys fit into that, how much you supply them and would actually take a piece of that share that they're talking about and how you're competing with them as well? Just to kind of clarify the relationship interplay between you guys and the ODMs on liquid cooling. Thank you.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Sure, Steve. So to the first of your questions, the \u2013 clearly, we were talking about projects and order lumpiness. The market has not changed in that respect. We have in Q3 exceeded our guidance and orders, our expectations. So things have happened nicely. But again, what is particularly important for us is that we stayed at a strong trailing 12 months and that is what defines the fact that long-term trajectory. So I wouldn\u2019t comment specifically has this job moved in or moved out. And we explained some of those dynamics in Q2 to give color. We are happy with the way the pipeline is unfolding into orders and we have strong pipelines going forward. And indeed as we\u2019re saying, a quarter-on-quarter pipeline growth and it\u2019s definitely a trend this one that we have experienced over the several quarters now. So all good. We feel very positive about the orders situation. When it comes to the second question talking about ODMs, ODMs play certainly an important role in the go-to-market for the likes of us. ODMs in a play that for liquid cooling sometimes is a white space play. They have a role with their servers, with their racks, with their integration. So it\u2019s natural that they integrate liquid cooling technology in what they do. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don\u2019t. And when they do, they can do that with private labeled products or they can do with products that are the original vendors labeled. When we think about those ODMs, we think of them as a go-to-market for us. And those ODMs very often also rely on our ability not only to deliver and provide technology, but also to provide the service and the liquid cooling know-how at rack, row and system level that they might need kind of being complemented with. So we do not look at that part of the market as competition. We look at a part of the market that we have opportunity to synergize with.\nSteve Tusa: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Amit, please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Gio, I have a clarification which is I understand your decision to not provide order guide going forward. Is it fair to think that you folks will keep disclosing order numbers on a trailing 12 month basis going forward? If you just clarify that that would be really helpful. And my question really is, as we think about calendar 2025 revenue acceleration that you\u2019re talking about, could you talk about how do you expect backlog to trend in that framework? Is acceleration only coming from backlog normalizing or you think there\u2019s enough demand that the backlog can grow and revenues can accelerate in 2025? Thank you.\nGiordano Albertazzi: So yes, to your point \u2013 and good day, Amit. So your point about trailing 12, yes, as we mentioned already last time, we are moving to trailing 12. So think in those terms please when you think about what to expect from Vertiv going forward. We believe that trailing 12 is really the best metric as we talk about lumpiness of orders. But the lumpiness of orders is really meaningful because it\u2019s combined with the individual order size that can become very, very big. So trading 12 as we\u2019re explaining is the way forward and it\u2019s the best indication for everyone. When it comes to the 2025 revenue acceleration, probably a little bit premature to elaborate too much on that. We probably will try to narrow the focus further in Atlanta in November. And by the same token, elaborating on the backlog and how the backlog will unfold during 2025 would still be premature. But suffice to say that we are operating in a market that is favorable, we are winning in this market and we are seeing strong pipelines and we see this acceleration also happen more so globally than in the past. The landscape is certainly favorable and we are optimistic about that, I think more in Atlanta.\nAmit Daryanani: Great. Thank you.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andy, please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, everyone.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Good morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Gio, maybe just to clarify the competition question a little more, are you still getting the same win rate or even a higher win rate as the market moves further into liquid cooling and as Blackwell powered data centers begin to ramp up? And are you getting that 3 million to 3.5 million per megawatt content that you told us about at your last Investor Day on the high density compute focused projects that are out there at this point?\nGiordano Albertazzi: We will not go necessarily talking about win rates and how exactly win rates evolve. If we talk about individual product lines that will be probably too much, too much, too much detail to be really useful. But we clearly have different expectations of win rates for different product lines. And it\u2019s pretty \u2013 how can I say, sophisticated in terms of how we guide and expect internally and how we expect and we drive our business. We are happy with the trajectory of our win rates and our win rates are consistent with our market share ambitions. And this is definitely true also for liquid cooling. When it comes to the second part of your question, is \u2013 maybe second question, is how is your TAM per megawatts evolving? You've seen what the 3, 3.5 [ph] \u2013 we're still in transition. We're still in transition. But what we \u2013 the signal that we see are pointing in the direction of that additional a $0.5 million TAM per megawatt that we indicated in November last year. And that's something that also we will elaborate on further in the plant.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeff, please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just coming back to Slide 5 and just kind of thinking about the array of, kind of thermal solutions you have. Can you maybe speak to what extent, maybe customers historically bought this way, kind of outdoor to the chip? I would imagine it's very minuscule, maybe historically, but is that changing with AI and raising product or project complexity and just the higher stakes involved? And can you demonstrate to customers that Vertiv integrating all three of these can somehow deliver kind of better efficiency, energy savings than maybe going best-of-breed? Maybe you guys are really good in room and row, but trains got better chillers or something, right? Can you actually demonstrate that an integrated solution from Vertiv is superior to trying to pick best-of- breed?\nGiordano Albertazzi: Hi, Jeff. Thanks for the question. The first part of your question, I think, is if we see historically, the entire portfolio, even pre-liquid cooling sold to a customer, or if it's more a point product. I would say that it is very much a combination. It's all the time and pretty much all the time. We talk the entire portfolio and with many customers, we sell the entire portfolio as a matter of fact, and this is true, pretty, and let's say post-liquid cooling, but it's in different portion, in different geographies or for different customers. So in that respect, having the entire portfolio is an advantage for us. Again, sales leverage go-to-market opportunities, and especially now as the technology evolves dramatically, and ability to sit around the table and talk about the problem and the entire solution, not just the individual box is something especially the large customers appreciate a lot and get a lot of value from. The second part of your question is, can demonstrate \u2013 can you demonstrate the TCO de facto [ph]? Yes, we demonstrate the TCO. We believe that our products deliver a lot of efficiency footprint in a number of advantages. There, of course, are specifically to the individual product. And when the product becomes a solution, and this is true in general across our portfolio, not just for thermal, then advantages in terms of footprint, the speed of deployment. Again, various aspects of total cost of ownership that can go from the initial cost, initial cost of installation and efficiency and footprint, they all come to fruition. So we feel pretty good about the strength of our portfolio and even more so when that is an entire solution.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott, please go ahead.\nScott Davis: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Davis: The amount of cash you guys are generating now is a big number. It's a high class problem, I guess, but you did the big buyback when the stock was really down in the dumps. What are you guys thinking now with your excess cash? Are there M&A opportunities out there that you're looking at? Or just like take that balance sheet down a little bit more?\nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, yes, it's a good problem to have, if you will. It's certainly a position that is very different than a few years ago, let's put it this way. So we like where we are, but also because it is enabling our cash allocation strategy. We'll talk more about our cash allocation strategy when we have an investor event in a couple of three weeks. But in general, very interested in M&A. M&A is part of our strategy. So we continue and indeed, we have strengthened our, let's say, radar screen, and we're actively involved in an M&A process or so, I think we have reinforced that process quite a lot. So more on our capital allocation strategy when we are together, but definitely focus on M&A.\nScott Davis: Okay, helpful Gio. And hey, I don't want to get ahead of the guidance or more color in a couple of weeks. But it sounds like to me that you've gotten a lot more confident in your ability to drive incremental margins at that kind of 40% or higher level. Is that confidence based on your ability to capture price for the value that you're creating and/or kind of capacity adds capacity coming on without any hiccups? I mean, again, I don\u2019t want to take away from what you\u2019re going to talk about in a couple of weeks. But if there\u2019s any color you can give us, it just feels like you guys have gotten a little bit more confident in your ability to generate profits of that growth?\nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, I\u2019ll say, Scott, that the equation and the formula has not changed dramatically, normally [ph] may change dramatically. And we know it very well. There is an operational leverage element. And of course, volume helps that significantly. And we continue to operate in \u2013 we believe we\u2019ll continue to operate in a price cost favorable environment going forward. So the two things combined make us on look optimistically to the future.\nScott Davis: Okay. We\u2019ll see you in a couple of weeks. Thank you.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Nicole, please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe just first a follow-up on the order discussion. I know last quarter when you first discussed going to trailing 12-month orders, you kind of noted that we should expect them to stay in the 30% to 35% growth zone. Is that still the view? And then if you could also just talk about, I mean you guys put some more capacity into place with the new facility that you announced this quarter. How do you feel about current capacity and the need to do further expansion based on pipeline growth? Thank you.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Okay. So to the first part, orders and trailing 12 again, the \u2013 we said two things. We will go to trailing 12. We were talking about 30%, 35% for the third quarter. At 37% in the third quarter is something that is, we believe quite strong. I think it\u2019s premature to talk about future ranges. But again we\u2019ve said, and I said it in my \u2013 when we were going through the slides that we will not guide on orders, sorry, given a TTM range would be exactly the same. So I\u2019ll stick to that statement, if you will. But again, look at the \u2013 we look at the pipeline, we look at our \u2013 the dynamic in the industry, and we look at our strength in the industry. So we are optimistic. So that translates of course, in growth and capacity. In general, the situation of capacity is not \u2013 it\u2019s dramatically different from what we said before. But \u2013 so that we always have that wiggle room to be able to accelerate in the short term if needed. That might not be true across all product lines. But in general that ability to accelerate is there just the way we design our capacity. But also capacity should not be viewed as something static or something that moves in step, say from one year to another, but it's something that is constantly growing. Yes, a new plant like Pelzer will have a step up. But in general, if you think about what we\u2019re doing across the 23 factories, there is a constant expansion on the one hand and sometimes expanding an existing factory is faster and generates kind of a expansion and revenue more rapidly than a brand new factory. And so that\u2019s something that we do quite currently. But also our vertical operating system and all the lean activities that we constantly implement and progress on is liberating capacity and that will continue. We do not see that as necessarily as a one-off activity. That will continue. As new product lines are launched, the productivity and the leaning continuous improvement liberates capacity. So think about our capacity is something that is constantly trending if you will northwest on the chart, sometimes with the stats, like in the case of Pelzer. And we believe we have the capacity to support our growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel, please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And by the way, getting off this order guidance is a great thing. So I\u2019m pretty supportive. And \u2013 but that said, I\u2019m not going to ask you about 4Q orders. Trust me on that. So yes, by the way, how is the backlog shape up? So just on the\u2026\nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you.\nNigel Coe: If you can just clarify, first of all, the comment on the content opportunity in sort of the hybrid thermal management, did you say that content\u2019s gone up by $0.5 million per megawatts? We\u2019re now looking at 3.5 to 4 million. And if that\u2019s the case, what\u2019s driving that? Is it just inflation or is there some scope there? But really, I\u2019m just curious, the visibility you have for 2025. Clearly, you\u2019ve got a lot of backlog. But I\u2019m curious if the view on 2025 obviously 14% or more. If that\u2019s driven by backlog already built or if there\u2019s some view on backlog development going forward? Thanks.\nGiordano Albertazzi: So when it comes to the content, no, just to be clear, when we were talking about that 0.5 million, I was referring back in the context of the question that I \u2013 that we were asked is, it was reaffirming, if you will, the 2.53 [ph] million per megawatt going on an AI high density to the 3, 3.5 [ph].\nNigel Coe: Okay.\nGiordano Albertazzi: So not different from what we discussed probably now assume for the last 12 months and something that we will reanalyze when we're together. When it comes to 205 [ph] backlog, clearly, you asked a backlog. So you're asking kind of a very, very forward-looking, but let's say this way. We are happy with the backlog and clearly, the situation of our backlog for 2025 is encouraging, obviously. Otherwise, we would not be in any indication that we have given. And at the same time, every year is a combination of what you have in the backlog and what you book and ship, at least ship book relative to the vantage point. So in this case, the vantage point, I would say, the 2nd of October when we cut a line here to these numbers. So clearly, there is a book and ship to deliver in 2025. But when we analyze things, we know that's always the case. So it's everything measured and evaluated relative to our historical dynamics and relative to our pipeline and the potential of the pipeline. So it's a combination of the two. And hopefully, I'm answering your question, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Perfectly. Thanks Gio.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. Noah, please go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: All right. Thank you. And just to piggyback on this, Gio, for the last few quarters you talked about the elongation in order to revenue conversion cycle times for cloud and colo. And that's supporting some of the strength and visibility you have going into 2025. But just what drives your confidence in remaining price cost positive in 2025 given that longer conversion cycle?\nGiordano Albertazzi: When we were talking, first of all, thanks for the question, Noah. When we think in terms of the elongation, we were talking about the elongation happening de facto and specifically for the cola and large cola and hyperscale. And that elongation was at 12, was, let's say from the 9, 15 months to the 12, 18 months. So it's not a dramatic elongation. We're talking about a three-month elongation. So we have good visibility on our pipelines. We have of course, very good visibility on our backlog. We have visibility on the price elements of that backlog and pipeline. We have good visibility on the cost side of the equation. And the cost side of the equation, of course, is very, very important. So combine the two, enhance our continued reiterated statement that we believe price cost to continue to be favorable.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, maybe just to sneak one more in that, you know, the net CapEx I think the guide is around $200 million for the year, and that implies something like $80 million in 4Q. If I've got my math right, what's just driving this CapEx pattern? And maybe help us understand substantively the increase in CapEx versus the prior quarter's run rate.\nDavid Fallon: Yes. Thanks, Noah. This is David. So I can tell you, first of all, we do not try to plan the year to have CapEx accelerate as you go through the quarters. It just happens to happen that way almost every year. So if you could look back historically, our fourth quarter is generally the highest quarter as it relates to CapEx, and the first quarter is the lowest. And we certainly have that $80 million plan. Can I guarantee that all of this going to happen within the three months in the fourth quarter? I'm not sure. Some could slip into Q1 but the one thing that is certain is that we continue to expand capacity. We have very specific identified projects and we're executing upon those right now.\nNoah Kaye: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Michael Elias of TD Cowen. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones, if I may. First, I want to be absolutely clear. Are you saying that your demand pipeline entering 4Q is higher than the levels you saw entering 3Q? That's my first question. And then second, I just want to revisit a prior question related to like elongating lead times. One of the things that we're seeing in the data center market is that as the preleasing window elongates and we go further out, the lower pricing that, that data center capacity is commanding. So as I think through the equipment side, does it stand to reason that as the customer lead time elongates, Vertiv actually has less pricing power in the conversation? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you, Mike. The answer to the first question is if \u2013 the answer is yes. I was just trying to think about the formulation. But yes, that pipeline entering Q4 is higher than the pipeline entering Q3, no doubt. So that is a resounding, yes. When it comes to the elongated lead times, we do not necessarily see a correlation between lead time elongation. And again, I want to remind everyone it's not a lead time elongation because of Vertiv's need to elongate lead time. So we can, most of the time deliver on shorter lead time on their request. But simply because of lead time gets elongated because that is consistent with our customers, project plans and schedules. So we do not see that correlation our end, but yes, I can't elaborate more that \u2013 than much in that, but what we like on the elongation of lead times is that it helps us; it gives us time to be more ready from a supply chain standpoint in every respect, capacity, negotiation, et cetera, et cetera. So all good things.\nMichael Elias: Great. Thanks for the call, Gio. See you in Atlanta.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Thanks. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Delaney: Yes, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Can you provide more detail on how orders have grown, either in the third quarter or on a TTM basis between products and services? And could you share more on the services business specifically and how the shift to liquid cooling is affecting services revenue growth and bookings potential? Thank you.\nGiordano Albertazzi: So we're pretty happy about the direction of travel of orders for service in general, and we are quite satisfied also how that translates, into service or sales. So I'd say that if you think about the trajectory of the service business is very much reinforcing our value, let's say equation, but not just the value that we provide to investors as well, also but certainly the value that we provide to our customers. And we see more increasing demand for our services. In general, and certainly, specifically for liquid cooling. We have capabilities in liquid cooling in terms of installation and commissioning and life cycle services and let's say predictive maintenance digitally enabled that are quite unique in the industry. And that's something that is very convincing our customer base and reinforces our product value proposition. We have trained and we continue to train a lot of engineers. We want to make sure that there is no shortage of field service, liquid cooling capacities to serve the industry \u2013 the industry, not just that.\nMark Delaney: Thank you.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question goes to Brett Linzey of Mizuho. Brett, please go ahead.\nBrett Linzey: Hello all. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to come back to thermal management. I appreciate the long-term forecast. You guys have always been very, very active on new investment, liquid cooling becoming a bigger component. Should we begin to see thermal application growth outpacing the power side going forward? Is there any major divergence we should be thinking about?\nGiordano Albertazzi: A couple of questions right here. One is certainly inside the let say large, very large thermal portfolio of Vertiv's. Clearly the liquid cooling itself will be characterized by high growth rates. Because of the dynamics of the market, as we explain on Page 5, but also because we believe we're taking much [ph] share. So combined the two, certainly it accelerates, accelerates things, but as we mentioned the demand is quite balanced across the various portfolios and business units, but various parts of the business. And as we said the AI and high density and anyway, high performance compute is beneficial to the entire portfolio. So we will elaborate more on this aspect when we are together in Atlanta. But another aspect is very interesting is that power management, power is going to, as the densification continues, power will continue to grow. So we're very encouraged by what we see in power and the dynamics that the densification will drive. The other element that we talked about, service, of course, I can only reaffirm that, but the other aspect is infrastructure and prefabrication. With the constraints in the industry in terms of speed of building new data centers, prefabrications becoming more and more important. So yes, we will certainly see a positive acceleration coming from liquid cooling, but that\u2019s a \u2013 and we believe the entire portfolio will be favorable impact.\nBrett Linzey: Okay. Appreciate the detail. Leave it at one.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Gio Albertazzi for any closing comments.\nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you very much and thank you for the extra 10 minutes with us. I think it was important to add a little bit more time for Q&A. I really like to thank the Vertiv team for another strong quarter, another strong quarter of execution. So a big thank you for joining us today. And again, thank you for your questions. Really appreciate the support, and see you in Atlanta.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Cote",
            "content": "Good morning. Q3 was another very strong quarter across the board on every metrics, sales, income, cash flow and orders. Fourth quarter guidance is strong and sales for 2025 looks stronger still based on wicked good autos [ph] performance. And importantly, there is more goodness ahead as our portfolio expands, new products are introduced and the Vertiv Operating System, or VOS, becomes reality. There are two areas I'd like to address specifically where investors seem to oscillate between fear and excitement. The first is AI reality and the second is liquid cooling. We had the agricultural revolution, then the industrial revolution and now we're only about 40 years into the digital revolution. AI is just the next step in that digital revolution. AI is real, and it has just begun. It's got a long way to go. Data centers are fundamental to all that computing. There is no other alternative even on the horizon. Distributed architecture enhances need for data centers, even quantum computing relies on digital-based data centers. We've enjoyed extremely strong orders in the first half of 2024 and we would agree that continued approximately 60% order increases are unlikely as we tried to say last quarter. By the same token, we are seeing robust backlog building growth supporting orders continue. Cloud and AI reinforce each other and drive the need for a lot of computing. Additionally, the AI ramp-up in countries outside the U.S. is just beginning. This bodes extremely well for Vertiv for a long time as a market leader in data center infrastructure. As the data center infrastructure develops, liquid cooling increasingly comes to the fore and we continue to rapidly gain share. There are various parts to a liquid cooling system and like all our products, we've worked to position ourselves in the high IP and know-how areas, specifically, CDUs and total systems. Here are several charts in this presentation to simplify understanding of a liquid cool system, our position and why we will continue to gain share in this rapidly growing market. Our data center products portfolio is the broadest in the industry. It's also important to note that while rapidly growing, we are not just in liquid cooling. Everything is growing well. We have extensive coverage in thermal systems, power management, IT solutions, modular and services. AI and data center growth in this digital age benefits everything we do, not just liquid cooling. While it's true there is competition in liquid cooling, that's also true of all our markets. We won't win 100% of all orders, but I believe we will continue to gain share because of our technology base and broad portfolio, global scale, deep industry expertise, global service and strong customer relationships. These are distinguishing characteristics that others in the market can't match. Vertiv's role is an important one in the industry. We worked very closely on roadmap consistency with key technology providers to be ready for today and seeing around the corners to what the industry needs to do next. A great example of this is the joint announcement we did last week with NVIDIA, highlighting the co-development partnership for the AI factory of the present and future. The industry needs to be ready for this new era of compute and Vertiv is working closely with our customers, so they will be ready for what is coming. While there is intense focus right now on every aspect of AI and the data center market, I would encourage investors who scare themselves about the AI future or Vertiv's role to instead take a longer-term view of the secular growth story in front of us. There is a multi-decade growth trajectory unfolding. Competition is not a new phenomenon, and we expect there to be competitors in the market as there always have been. Vertiv's advantages though are not easily replicated and we are further expanding them. That is what I saw five years ago as I looked at this unique company, market leadership, global scale, technology differentiation, great end markets and longstanding customer relationships. The foundational elements for value creation were there, but it needed to be unlocked in a convincing way with strong leadership. I credit Gio and his team for doing the hard work to start unlocking the full potential of Vertiv. We are still far from our full potential and that is the most exciting part as I think about what is coming next quarter, next year and for many years ahead. And it is certainly supported by our orders and operational performance. So with that, I will turn the call over to Gio."

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Perfect. Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 8. This slide summarizes our third quarter financial results. Organic net sales up 19%, $114 million above the midpoint of guidance, with that upside driven by favorable timing of shipments in both the Americas and EMEA. Our backlog is strong. And with available production capacity, we were able to realize these additional sales previously projected for the fourth quarter. Double-digit organic growth was seen across all three regions, with EMEA leading the way at 25% and demonstrating that strength in the data center demand is not only an American story, but it is indeed global. Adjusted operating profit of $417 million was $121 million higher than last year, primarily driven by higher volume and commercial execution. Adjusted operating margin of 20.1% represents a significant milestone, surpassing 20% for the first time. We shared last year in our investor event a long-term ambition of 20% plus. It is safe to assume that the 0.1% above the 20% in the third quarter does not define the upper limit of that plus. We believe there is plenty of upside opportunity and a lot of work to do with margins, and we plan to share our revised long-term ambition in this year's November 18th Investor event. Now back to third quarter margins. We did incur launch costs for our new infrastructure solutions facility in Pelzer in the third quarter as well as at several existing facilities where we are expanding internal capacity and these launch costs as well as some project mix negatively impacted third quarter growth margin compared with the second quarter. Some of these launch costs were one time in nature, but others are permanent and we expect those to be more fully absorbed in gross margin with higher volume going forward. Finally, on this page, our adjusted free cash flow was $336 million, $115 million better than last year, driven by higher profitability and continued improved trade working capital, which declined to 16% of annualized third quarter sales. Now that figure had been consistently above 20% in recent prior years, so some good progress there, but once again, similar to margins, still a ton of opportunity. Our adjusted free cash flow conversion was 116% in the third quarter, the second consecutive quarter over 100%. Now turning to Slide 9, this slide summarizes our third quarter segment results. As mentioned, we saw double-digit sales growth across all three regions. Americas had another strong quarter, organic sales up 21% with broad strength across multiple market verticals and product lines, including a material contribution from liquid cooling in the third quarter. Adjusted operating margin expanded 470 basis points, largely driven by operational leverage and strong commercial execution. APAC sales increased 10% organically, with China growing double-digits. Although we are pleased with this growth in China, which represents about 10% of our overall business, we are not projecting that same double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, maybe out of prudence or conservatism, as China still operates in a challenging macro environment. APAC adjusted operating margin declined 260 basis points from third quarter of 2023, primarily due to unfavorable mix and a favorable discrete item in last year's third quarter. But APAC operating margins did improve sequentially from the second quarter as expected, and we anticipate further sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter. EMEA organic sales increased 25%, driven by continued strong demand from Colocation and Hyperscale customers, and very encouragingly, growth was broad across our product and services portfolios. Looking forward, as Gio mentioned, visibility into a strong pipeline of AI-related demand in EMEA is becoming clear. Adjusted operating margin expanded 400 basis points to 25.9% and in the quarterly competition with the Americas, EMEA won for the second consecutive quarter. But of course, we anticipate another close race between those two regions as we close out the year. Moving to Slide 10, this slide summarizes our fourth quarter guidance. We are expecting a strong close to the year, with fourth quarter sales expected to be up 13% organically, with the regional profile reflecting Americas up high-teens and APAC and EMEA up mid to high-single digits from last year's fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of $437 million at the midpoint and adjusted operating margin of 20.4% with continued expansion from the third quarter margin driven by operational leverage, commercial execution, and productivity gains. We anticipate year-over-year incremental margins of 39% in the fourth quarter, which translates into a projected 46% incremental margin for the full year. Next, turning to Slide 11, our full year guidance. We are increasing guidance for sales by $140 million, a combination of volume and foreign exchange. Full year expected organic growth is now 14%, with this increase primarily driven by the Americas and EMEA, both expected to post mid-teens growth from 2023. We are increasing our full year adjusted operating profit guidance by $50 million to $1.485 billion with $32 million from the third quarter beat and $18 million from the fourth quarter raise. Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to be 19% at the midpoint, 30 basis points higher than our previous full year guidance and a 370 basis point improvement from 2023. We are certainly pleased but not satisfied with our margin performance in 2024. In November of last year, we initially guided to 16.7% versus the 19% we are currently guiding. The consistent quarterly beaten raise with this metric demonstrates our continued progress with operational leverage, commercial execution and productivity business wide, driven by the Vertiv operating system, and as mentioned, more to come. Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.68 is more than 50% higher than 2023, which translates into a very healthy PEG ratio. The higher earnings per share is primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit. We continue to provide additional information on income taxes and share count in the appendix of this presentation, and we will be more than happy to discuss any details on either of these topics after the call. On the far right side of this slide, we raised our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance to $1 billion, an increase of $125 million from prior guidance. This implies fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow of approximately $230 million and a projected net leverage at year-end of approximately 1.2 times, providing the needed flexibility to exercise our capital deployment strategy going forward. In conclusion, we believe that a strong fourth quarter exit in 2024 indeed positions us very well for a strong 2025. So with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. Hi, Steve. Yes. Thanks, Noah. This is David. So I can tell you, first of all, we do not try to plan the year to have CapEx accelerate as you go through the quarters. It just happens to happen that way almost every year. So if you could look back historically, our fourth quarter is generally the highest quarter as it relates to CapEx, and the first quarter is the lowest. And we certainly have that $80 million plan. Can I guarantee that all of this going to happen within the three months in the fourth quarter? I'm not sure. Some could slip into Q1 but the one thing that is certain is that we continue to expand capacity. We have very specific identified projects and we're executing upon those right now."

            "name": "Giordano Albertazzi",
            "content": "Well, thank you. Thank you, Dave. And we go to Slide 3. This was another strong quarter. Q3 organic sales were up 19% with double-digit growth in all three regions. Orders were a 37% growth on a trailing 12-month basis; meet our expectation, thanks to third quarter up 17% on a year-on-year basis despite tougher comparatives. The demand we see is resilient and this 37% trailing 12 corroborates the ambition for long-term growth. Adjusted operating profit at $417 million beat guidance. 20.1% adjusted operating margin expanded 310 basis points, our first time surpassing the 20% mark, an indication for the potential ahead. Adjusted free cash flow was $336 million in the third quarter and we have generated $773 million year-to-date. Leverage reduced to 1.4x as of the end of Q3, while we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We again raised our full year guidance across all financial metrics and expect organic growth of 14%, adjusted operating profit of $1.485 million and margins expanding to 19%. We also expect adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion, up $125 million from previous guidance. The orders trends and our robust backlog indicate that growth in 2025 will accelerate relative to 2024's 14%. Let's go to Slide 4. As said, at 37%, our trailing 12-month order growth remains very convincing. Pipelines continue to grow we saw pipeline increase sequentially from Q3 \u2013 from Q2 to Q3 across all regions. We also are seeing more convincing signals that AI is indeed accelerating in EMEA. We are not providing a view on Q4 orders. Do not read too much into this. Orders are hard to forecast. They can be lumpy, exact timing often outside our control, and it ultimately depends on when the customer is ready to issue a PO. With that said, I'd also like to assure you that we feel good, in fact, quite encouraged, that the order trajectory will remain healthy and support the financial ambition that we are targeting. Our backlog continues to strengthen up to $7.4 billion at the end of Q3, and this supports our view that growth will accelerate from 2024 to 2025. Let's now look at the right side of Slide 4. We have sharp focus on our capacity. We want to make sure we stay ahead of the demand signals and enable growth. We continue to expand capacity. An example is the recently announced, newly integrated, modular solutions facility in the Americas. This facility has started production and shipments in third quarter and it is helping us meet our customers' needs for rapid data center capacity deployment. Our focus on supply chain is intense. We see the demand trajectory unfolding for years ahead, and we're making sure our supply chain is resilient in terms of supplier redundancy and geographic diversity. Inflation will continue. We incorporate that expectation in how we approach our commercial excellence programs. The Vertiv Operating System continues to deliver incremental capacity, productivity gains, reduced lead times, fundamental to our ability to execute at speed and scale. Let's go to Slide 5 now. We have others a few slides in the presentation to fully describe our position in thermal management and more specifically liquid cooling for data centers. Let's start broad. Vertiv has the most complete portfolio of critical, digital infrastructure products, solutions and services. Sales are well balanced across the five business groups, power management representing 32% of our business; thermal management 30%; IT systems 10%; infrastructure solutions 5%; and services 23%. The impact of AI is favorable to the entire Vertiv portfolio in terms of total volume and TAM per megawatt. The total vertical opportunity is much larger than just the opportunity in thermal, and we love thermal. It's very important. So let's talk about it. And let's focus on the right side of the chart. We have the entire range of thermal chain technologies from outside the data center building to inside the rack, everything as an example, from a chiller to new rack CDU or/and a manifold. Liquid and air cooling coexist for heat collection in the data center of the future. In all cases, liquid and air cooling, no matter the mix of the two, require heat rejection or heat reuse so chillers, direct expansion, condensers, et cetera. So not air or liquid, air and liquid, and heat rejection for the foreseeable future. Now please focus on the thermal market bars on the very right part of the page. We believe from a market value standpoint that air and heat rejection combined will be 70% of the market and liquid 30% over the next few years. Air and heat rejection will grow at a 10% CAGR and liquid at a 30% CAGR, all growing very nicely. We have serious intentions to be the market leader in liquid cooling. Vertiv's growth in liquid cooling exceeds the market growth, and we believe we are rapidly gaining market share. We see that in our orders, we see orders converting to revenue in a convincing way. This quarter is a strong example. Slide 6. I want to describe what Vertiv leadership in liquid cooling means. Focus please on the left side of the slide. Also portfolio, first and foremost, Vertiv has a complete range of liquid and high density solutions, in particular, in-rack CDUs, 1-phase row CDUs, 2-phase row CDUs, manifolds, rear door heat exchangers, immersion cooling. And we are cold-plate agnostic. And we like that approach as it enables our CDUs to be validated across multiple cold-plate technologies and server brands. We are proud of our portfolio, but there is more to our liquid cooling trend than the strength of our portfolio. It is future readiness. We are working today on the products that enable the technology roadmaps of the most influential silicon providers. Our products must precede theirs in the field. Innovation, we are significantly increasing our investment in high density cooling engineering to continue to lead in the future. Complete thermal chain. The data center of the future will have both air and liquid in a mix that will vary during the life cycle of the data center based on the loads and the IT refresh cycles. So having the ability to master all cooling technology is of the essence. Ability to customize at scale, indeed global scale, we are on track to scale our liquid cooling technology, 45x by the end of this year. We are not stopping there. Service strength. Data center expertise and service footprint are vastly different between players. For Vertiv, we have been servicing data centers for multiple decades. We have about 4,000 service engineers deployed globally and growing. Long-standing customer relationships, they need a partner that has the expertise to understand the significant changes ahead and can deliver clear TCO advantages. Reliability and quality, Vertiv has a reputation earned over several decades of keeping data centers up and running. This is what liquid cooling market leadership looks like. And I'm proud of our position. We are seeing this translating into strong orders and now sales. Let's go to Slide 7, and let's zoom out a bit. Let's look at our partnership with NVIDIA. You may have seen the recent announcements of our co-development of complete power and cooling reference designs for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 platform. We are helping data center operators getting ahead of the challenges and enabling the vision of AI factors. Vertiv's advantages on the prior slide exactly why we are uniquely able to play this important role for the industry and why there is a very organic relationship between NVIDIA and Vertiv. We make sure our technology enables NVIDIA roadmaps today and in the future. A great example of enabling the industry to be future-ready is our truly unique Vertiv CoolPhase CDU, which makes it simple to deploy high density liquid cooling where needed without having to reengineer the entire data center environment, even in the absence of a chilled water loop. Vertiv can seamlessly \u2013 sorry, Vertiv can seamlessly embed in one solution, the ability to navigate the transition between liquid and air cooled service. We can develop these unique solutions because we \u2013 because of our decade-long expertise around these technologies. So with that, over to David. Well, thank you. Thank you, David. And talking about 2025, let's go to Slide 12. And here are some of the early thoughts. In a nutshell, we are excited about the year ahead. The market is strong and we're certainly feeling the AI tailwinds that should continue to strengthen next year. We have good visibility, we have sharp executional focus and price cost is expected to be positive. This results in our expectation for growth in 2025 to be higher than our growth in 2024 with expected expansion of adjusted operating margins and strong free cash flow generation. Let's go to Slide 13. This is a quick reminder. We have an upcoming investor event in Atlanta, Georgia on Monday, November 18. It is also an opportunity to tour our booth at SC24 the following morning. So we hope we will see you there. Summarize things and go to Slide 14. The data center market is strong and the market is coming towards Vertiv. We are ready for this. Not only are we delivering strong growth, but we are also demonstrating our ability to deliver on profit and cash in a convincing manner. We have raised our full year guidance again and we continue the relentless pursuit for better. There is always room for improvement and that is the mindset we adopt every day. We stay humble and focused the intensity of stepping up. This is the right time to go faster, drive differentiation and deliver premium results. I'm holding the Vertiv team and myself directly accountable to do just that. So with that, over to the operator, Nadia, for Q&A. First of all, we definitely see this large campuses and large data center deployments happen and happen at really large scale. Not just scale all the buildings, but scale across the market. In general, we get good visibility on the entire program, but the exact way in which POs are placed, if you will, really specific to the individual hyperscaler or even speaking about very large deployment colo, some colos have very large deployment themselves. But again, they have different models. But in general that the prevalent is they place POs for the buildings that are in the project of being deployed at that time. So as we said in a previous call, we get certainly a longer visibility in terms of the PO that we receive from this part of the market. But the good thing is that we have the PO and the PO is needed for them and they are actually building and the visibility on the longer program. Good morning, Steve. Sure, Steve. So to the first of your questions, the \u2013 clearly, we were talking about projects and order lumpiness. The market has not changed in that respect. We have in Q3 exceeded our guidance and orders, our expectations. So things have happened nicely. But again, what is particularly important for us is that we stayed at a strong trailing 12 months and that is what defines the fact that long-term trajectory. So I wouldn't comment specifically has this job moved in or moved out. And we explained some of those dynamics in Q2 to give color. We are happy with the way the pipeline is unfolding into orders and we have strong pipelines going forward. And indeed as we're saying, a quarter-on-quarter pipeline growth and it's definitely a trend this one that we have experienced over the several quarters now. So all good. We feel very positive about the orders situation. When it comes to the second question talking about ODMs, ODMs play certainly an important role in the go-to-market for the likes of us. ODMs in a play that for liquid cooling sometimes is a white space play. They have a role with their servers, with their racks, with their integration. So it's natural that they integrate liquid cooling technology in what they do. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. And when they do, they can do that with private labeled products or they can do with products that are the original vendors labeled. When we think about those ODMs, we think of them as a go-to-market for us. And those ODMs very often also rely on our ability not only to deliver and provide technology, but also to provide the service and the liquid cooling know-how at rack, row and system level that they might need kind of being complemented with. So we do not look at that part of the market as competition. We look at a part of the market that we have opportunity to synergize with. So yes, to your point \u2013 and good day, Amit. So your point about trailing 12, yes, as we mentioned already last time, we are moving to trailing 12. So think in those terms please when you think about what to expect from Vertiv going forward. We believe that trailing 12 is really the best metric as we talk about lumpiness of orders. But the lumpiness of orders is really meaningful because it's combined with the individual order size that can become very, very big. So trading 12 as we're explaining is the way forward and it's the best indication for everyone. When it comes to the 2025 revenue acceleration, probably a little bit premature to elaborate too much on that. We probably will try to narrow the focus further in Atlanta in November. And by the same token, elaborating on the backlog and how the backlog will unfold during 2025 would still be premature. But suffice to say that we are operating in a market that is favorable, we are winning in this market and we are seeing strong pipelines and we see this acceleration also happen more so globally than in the past. The landscape is certainly favorable and we are optimistic about that, I think more in Atlanta. Thank you. Good morning. We will not go necessarily talking about win rates and how exactly win rates evolve. If we talk about individual product lines that will be probably too much, too much, too much detail to be really useful. But we clearly have different expectations of win rates for different product lines. And it's pretty \u2013 how can I say, sophisticated in terms of how we guide and expect internally and how we expect and we drive our business. We are happy with the trajectory of our win rates and our win rates are consistent with our market share ambitions. And this is definitely true also for liquid cooling. When it comes to the second part of your question, is \u2013 maybe second question, is how is your TAM per megawatts evolving? You've seen what the 3, 3.5 [ph] \u2013 we're still in transition. We're still in transition. But what we \u2013 the signal that we see are pointing in the direction of that additional a $0.5 million TAM per megawatt that we indicated in November last year. And that's something that also we will elaborate on further in the plant. Hi, Jeff. Thanks for the question. The first part of your question, I think, is if we see historically, the entire portfolio, even pre-liquid cooling sold to a customer, or if it's more a point product. I would say that it is very much a combination. It's all the time and pretty much all the time. We talk the entire portfolio and with many customers, we sell the entire portfolio as a matter of fact, and this is true, pretty, and let's say post-liquid cooling, but it's in different portion, in different geographies or for different customers. So in that respect, having the entire portfolio is an advantage for us. Again, sales leverage go-to-market opportunities, and especially now as the technology evolves dramatically, and ability to sit around the table and talk about the problem and the entire solution, not just the individual box is something especially the large customers appreciate a lot and get a lot of value from. The second part of your question is, can demonstrate \u2013 can you demonstrate the TCO de facto [ph]? Yes, we demonstrate the TCO. We believe that our products deliver a lot of efficiency footprint in a number of advantages. There, of course, are specifically to the individual product. And when the product becomes a solution, and this is true in general across our portfolio, not just for thermal, then advantages in terms of footprint, the speed of deployment. Again, various aspects of total cost of ownership that can go from the initial cost, initial cost of installation and efficiency and footprint, they all come to fruition. So we feel pretty good about the strength of our portfolio and even more so when that is an entire solution. Good morning, Scott. Well, yes, it's a good problem to have, if you will. It's certainly a position that is very different than a few years ago, let's put it this way. So we like where we are, but also because it is enabling our cash allocation strategy. We'll talk more about our cash allocation strategy when we have an investor event in a couple of three weeks. But in general, very interested in M&A. M&A is part of our strategy. So we continue and indeed, we have strengthened our, let's say, radar screen, and we're actively involved in an M&A process or so, I think we have reinforced that process quite a lot. So more on our capital allocation strategy when we are together, but definitely focus on M&A. Well, I'll say, Scott, that the equation and the formula has not changed dramatically, normally [ph] may change dramatically. And we know it very well. There is an operational leverage element. And of course, volume helps that significantly. And we continue to operate in \u2013 we believe we'll continue to operate in a price cost favorable environment going forward. So the two things combined make us on look optimistically to the future. Thank you. Good morning, Nicole. Okay. So to the first part, orders and trailing 12 again, the \u2013 we said two things. We will go to trailing 12. We were talking about 30%, 35% for the third quarter. At 37% in the third quarter is something that is, we believe quite strong. I think it's premature to talk about future ranges. But again we've said, and I said it in my \u2013 when we were going through the slides that we will not guide on orders, sorry, given a TTM range would be exactly the same. So I'll stick to that statement, if you will. But again, look at the \u2013 we look at the pipeline, we look at our \u2013 the dynamic in the industry, and we look at our strength in the industry. So we are optimistic. So that translates of course, in growth and capacity. In general, the situation of capacity is not \u2013 it's dramatically different from what we said before. But \u2013 so that we always have that wiggle room to be able to accelerate in the short term if needed. That might not be true across all product lines. But in general that ability to accelerate is there just the way we design our capacity. But also capacity should not be viewed as something static or something that moves in step, say from one year to another, but it's something that is constantly growing. Yes, a new plant like Pelzer will have a step up. But in general, if you think about what we're doing across the 23 factories, there is a constant expansion on the one hand and sometimes expanding an existing factory is faster and generates kind of a expansion and revenue more rapidly than a brand new factory. And so that's something that we do quite currently. But also our vertical operating system and all the lean activities that we constantly implement and progress on is liberating capacity and that will continue. We do not see that as necessarily as a one-off activity. That will continue. As new product lines are launched, the productivity and the leaning continuous improvement liberates capacity. So think about our capacity is something that is constantly trending if you will northwest on the chart, sometimes with the stats, like in the case of Pelzer. And we believe we have the capacity to support our growth. Thank you. So when it comes to the content, no, just to be clear, when we were talking about that 0.5 million, I was referring back in the context of the question that I \u2013 that we were asked is, it was reaffirming, if you will, the 2.53 [ph] million per megawatt going on an AI high density to the 3, 3.5 [ph]. So not different from what we discussed probably now assume for the last 12 months and something that we will reanalyze when we're together. When it comes to 205 [ph] backlog, clearly, you asked a backlog. So you're asking kind of a very, very forward-looking, but let's say this way. We are happy with the backlog and clearly, the situation of our backlog for 2025 is encouraging, obviously. Otherwise, we would not be in any indication that we have given. And at the same time, every year is a combination of what you have in the backlog and what you book and ship, at least ship book relative to the vantage point. So in this case, the vantage point, I would say, the 2nd of October when we cut a line here to these numbers. So clearly, there is a book and ship to deliver in 2025. But when we analyze things, we know that's always the case. So it's everything measured and evaluated relative to our historical dynamics and relative to our pipeline and the potential of the pipeline. So it's a combination of the two. And hopefully, I'm answering your question, Nigel. When we were talking, first of all, thanks for the question, Noah. When we think in terms of the elongation, we were talking about the elongation happening de facto and specifically for the cola and large cola and hyperscale. And that elongation was at 12, was, let's say from the 9, 15 months to the 12, 18 months. So it's not a dramatic elongation. We're talking about a three-month elongation. So we have good visibility on our pipelines. We have of course, very good visibility on our backlog. We have visibility on the price elements of that backlog and pipeline. We have good visibility on the cost side of the equation. And the cost side of the equation, of course, is very, very important. So combine the two, enhance our continued reiterated statement that we believe price cost to continue to be favorable. Well, thank you, Mike. The answer to the first question is if \u2013 the answer is yes. I was just trying to think about the formulation. But yes, that pipeline entering Q4 is higher than the pipeline entering Q3, no doubt. So that is a resounding, yes. When it comes to the elongated lead times, we do not necessarily see a correlation between lead time elongation. And again, I want to remind everyone it's not a lead time elongation because of Vertiv's need to elongate lead time. So we can, most of the time deliver on shorter lead time on their request. But simply because of lead time gets elongated because that is consistent with our customers, project plans and schedules. So we do not see that correlation our end, but yes, I can't elaborate more that \u2013 than much in that, but what we like on the elongation of lead times is that it helps us; it gives us time to be more ready from a supply chain standpoint in every respect, capacity, negotiation, et cetera, et cetera. So all good things. Thanks. Thanks a lot. So we're pretty happy about the direction of travel of orders for service in general, and we are quite satisfied also how that translates, into service or sales. So I'd say that if you think about the trajectory of the service business is very much reinforcing our value, let's say equation, but not just the value that we provide to investors as well, also but certainly the value that we provide to our customers. And we see more increasing demand for our services. In general, and certainly, specifically for liquid cooling. We have capabilities in liquid cooling in terms of installation and commissioning and life cycle services and let's say predictive maintenance digitally enabled that are quite unique in the industry. And that's something that is very convincing our customer base and reinforces our product value proposition. We have trained and we continue to train a lot of engineers. We want to make sure that there is no shortage of field service, liquid cooling capacities to serve the industry \u2013 the industry, not just that. Thank you. A couple of questions right here. One is certainly inside the let say large, very large thermal portfolio of Vertiv's. Clearly the liquid cooling itself will be characterized by high growth rates. Because of the dynamics of the market, as we explain on Page 5, but also because we believe we're taking much [ph] share. So combined the two, certainly it accelerates, accelerates things, but as we mentioned the demand is quite balanced across the various portfolios and business units, but various parts of the business. And as we said the AI and high density and anyway, high performance compute is beneficial to the entire portfolio. So we will elaborate more on this aspect when we are together in Atlanta. But another aspect is very interesting is that power management, power is going to, as the densification continues, power will continue to grow. So we're very encouraged by what we see in power and the dynamics that the densification will drive. The other element that we talked about, service, of course, I can only reaffirm that, but the other aspect is infrastructure and prefabrication. With the constraints in the industry in terms of speed of building new data centers, prefabrications becoming more and more important. So yes, we will certainly see a positive acceleration coming from liquid cooling, but that's a \u2013 and we believe the entire portfolio will be favorable impact. Thanks a lot. Well, thank you very much and thank you for the extra 10 minutes with us. I think it was important to add a little bit more time for Q&A. I really like to thank the Vertiv team for another strong quarter, another strong quarter of execution. So a big thank you for joining us today. And again, thank you for your questions. Really appreciate the support, and see you in Atlanta."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Vertiv's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nLynne Maxeiner: Great, thank you, Brica. Good morning and welcome to Vertiv's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote, Chief Executive Officer Giordano Albertazzi, and Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon. Before we begin, I would like to point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risk and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date.

Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote.\nDave Cote: Good morning, everyone. Well, I am quite pleased with our continuing trend of very strong financial performance. As I think about what attracted me to Vertiv, it was a great position in a good industry. And fortunately, it turned into a great position in a great industry. There was a lot of work to do to get the business moving in a direction to consistently drive value and increase returns to shareholders. I have to say, Gio and his team have done an excellent job starting to unlock this potential. Initial signs of progress are evident in the financial metrics, strong audits and sales, and substantially increased profit and cash flow. A better operating company delivers better results. It's an interesting time both in our industry and the world at large. Significant change is underway for both. The industry is rapidly expanding and evolving, and Vertiv is well positioned to strengthen its market leadership with increasing R&D and capacity expansions to further distinguish our unique position as an industry leader. We're gaining market share in a rapidly growing industry as a result of our new products and significantly improved operations. At the same time, we're strengthening the resilience of our organization. 2024 is shaping up to be a great year and sets a very strong foundation for future years to deliver sustained value creation. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio.\nGio Albertazzi: Well, thank you. Thank you, Dave. And we go to Slide three. We had a very strong first half of 2024. Q2 organic sales were up 14% led by Americas, with strong growth in EMEA as well. We continue to see very strong orders growth, up 57% year-on-year, and up 10% sequentially from a very high level in Q1. Book-to-bill remains very high as well, with Q2 at 1.4x. More discussion to follow on this point on Slide five. Pipeline velocity has continued to increase and we are seeing the acceleration in large orders. The same dynamics we shared with you in April are continuing for large orders. Customers require longer delivery dates than in the past. Hence, a lot of the orders are creating backlog in 25 and beyond. Adjusted operating profit was $382 million and adjusted operating margins expanded 510 basis points to 19.6%. As Dave mentioned, better operating companies deliver better results. Our adjusted free cash flow is another good story, generating $333 million in the second quarter. We are converting our profitability to very good cash flow performance. Our net leverage was 1.8x at the end of Q2, so well within our targeted range of 1 to 2x. We again raised our full year guidance across all financial metrics and expect organic growth of 13%, adjusted operating profit of $1.435 billion, with margin expanding to 18.7%, and adjusted free cash flow of $875 million, up $50 million from previous guidance. Let's go to Slide four now. You may recognize this slide. We wanted to use it once again to give a directional indication of what we are seeing in the market. By and large, the market remains quite healthy and we see the continued acceleration of infrastructure built out in hyperscale and colo markets. High-density and liquid-cooled chips are a reality, and this accelerates the demand for AI infrastructure. We see this happening in the Americas, but also starting in EMEA and Asia, with some positive market signs for co-location and cloud in China as well. Enterprise remains stable, yet we expect to see AI positively impact enterprise over time, and this is starting in the Americas. Telecom remains subdued, as CapEx spending has yet to fully rebound. Commercial and industrial markets are healthy, as there is a lot of infrastructure spending happening in the Americas and APAC regions. So, overall, the market environment is encouraging, especially for data centers, which represent 75% of our end market exposure. We have heard feedback from investors about the data center market becoming a more conspicuous place these days from a competitive standpoint. This is true, but we believe we have competitive advantages that are tangible, quite unique, and being further reinforced. As data centers become more critical, I believe Vertiv becomes even more distinguished. We are not selling only one point product or only one small part of, say, the thermal chain. We are selling the entire critical infrastructure for data center. With power and cool and service data centers, we provide complete solutions. We act as the connective tissue between IT and facilities in a data center. It is a rare position in the industry, born of over 50 years of experience. We don't think this is easily replicated, and our orders are a good representation of our customers' trust in Vertiv. Certainly, there is intense focus on the liquid cooling portion of the market, and understandably so at this moment. Our advantages are clear. We have a comprehensive portfolio of liquid cooling technologies, direct-to-chip, immersion, in-row CDUs, in-rack CDUs. We adore heat exchanges, and we know how to integrate these key technologies into the entire thermal chain solution. This differentiates Vertiv. We continue to see direct-to-chip as our customers' prevailing technology of choice, and we have a complete portfolio of technology solutions ready for deployment. Surrounding this is a global service organization with almost 4,000 field service engineers. We're talking minutes and hours to get to a customer site. It is very important to our customers to have local service support. So we see market participants emerging with point products in liquid cooling, a small part of the overall thermal solution for a bigger center, but they have a far different profile than Vertiv. And I would say we aspire to be an even bigger player in liquid cooling, and we have very good reasons to believe our ambition is indeed reasonable. So let's move to Slide five now. Another quarter of extremely strong order growth. Pipeline velocity increased, and we continue to see AI scaling, especially in the Americas. The strength of orders is across our portfolio. Power management and thermal management orders grew at very similar rates in Q2, and both convincingly strong. There is a strong correlation between power and cooling, and we would expect that balance of sales in our portfolio to continue over time. This quarter, we have introduced a trailing 12-month orders metric. As we have previously highlighted, there can be a natural variation to the timing of large orders in any quarter. Trailing 12-month is a good metric to assess order activity, smoothing some of the quarter-to-quarter push and pulls. We also know we have increasingly tough comparisons ahead, and we believe we still see low double-digit orders growth in the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, but we expect a sequential decline in orders from an extremely high second quarter. This is where the trailing 12-month order metric can be helpful, as we expect to stay in the 30s range, indicating a very healthy and strong order trend, supportive of our financial guidance. As mentioned, customer request dates elongated for large projects in the hyper and colo space in general, as the scale of deployments continue to increase. We view this as the industry wanting to manage this growth and technology transition in an orderly manner. As a consequence, a lot of the orders are for future years, and we feel good about how 2025 is shaping. Pipeline, orders, backlog, all three are positive in the same direction, and we like what we are seeing. Let's now look at the right side of Slide five. We continue to focus on resilience to navigate an increasingly complicated geopolitical environment. Multi-sourcing strategies, risk identification and mitigation plans are key to building supply chain resilience. Inflation, we believe it is here to stay, as mentioned a few times. We price with this in mind and have a good process and governance in place to stay price-cost positive. We continue to expand capacity, including adding more modular and thermal management capacity in the Americas. Besides the expansion plans we already shared with you across the other technologies. The ramp-up of liquid cooling production capacity globally continues, and it is quite encouraging. This technology is in three of our plants today, and we are on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023. So we are investing at the same time. As we are investing at the same time, Vertiv operating system continues to be a key driver to liberate footprint capacity to accommodate our growth trajectory. If the market grows faster, we will not constrain ourselves, and we are diligent as we look at different demand scenarios. We believe our capital expenditure forecast of between $175 million and $200 million will cover the scenarios needed to meet the demand trajectory. Let's now go to Slide six. You have heard us mention service as a differentiator and one not easily replicated. Service is one of our superpowers. It demonstrates we have been in the data center industry for decades. Service represents 23% of our total sales last year, and additionally, the service business has the financial characteristics you would expect, including a strong margin profile that has been expanding. We like this part of the business a lot, and it is uniquely strong for Vertiv. Service opportunity is proportional to the critical nature of the application. In an AI high-density world, criticality is increasing, and we believe service matters even more. The stakes are significantly higher. The value of each rack can be in the millions of dollars. The thermal management and power management systems are becoming more complex, and the nature of the load more unforgiving. Telemetry, predictive services, and an ability to have experts on site in minutes or hours is essential. We are training our global service engineers proactively to be a partner of choice to help our customers navigate this complexity. In fact, I'm absolutely thrilled to share an exciting use case where Compass data centers have chosen Vertiv to provide full-time site-based embedded Vertiv tools to do service management and predictive maintenance on some Compass data center sites. The scale of data center deployment is becoming much larger. The value of dedicated service personnel on site full-time is becoming absolutely compelling. We thank Compass for their trust in Vertiv. With that, over to you, David.\nDavid Fallon: Great. Thanks, Gio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide seven, this slide summarizes our second quarter financial results. Our organic net sales increased approximately 14%, slightly above the high end of our guidance, primarily driven by, once again, strong performance in the Americas where organic sales were up 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating profit of $382 million was $131 million higher than last year, driven by the higher volume and improved variable contribution margin, which benefited from both year-over-year price cost and significant productivity gains. This improved productivity, which has been catalyzed by the continued implementation of VOS principles in our plants and within our functions and notably procurement, was the primary driver for the $57 million beat versus the midpoint of guidance and also a primary driver for the 510 basis points increase in adjusted operating margin to 19.6%. Just 40 basis points short of our long-term target. We are seeing the benefits of an intense focus on operational execution across all parts of the business, and the exciting thing is that there's still a lot more to do, so please stay tuned. Moving to the right, our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, $0.21 higher than last year, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit. We generated $333 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, over $100 million better than last year, primarily due to higher profitability and improved working capital, which declined to 17.1% of annualized second quarter sales. Some of this trade working capital improvement was due to favorable timing, including with advanced payments, which effectively shifted cash into the second quarter from the third and fourth quarters. Nonetheless, good progress with cash flow and working capital, but just like margins, still a lot more to do. Finally, on this page, net leverage was 1.8x at the end of the quarter within our stated leverage target range of 1x to 2x, and liquidity strengthened to $1.2 billion. Our balance sheet is strong and should remain strong based upon our expectations for free cash flow as we focus on flexibility to evaluate capital deployment opportunities. Turning to Page eight, this slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. As mentioned, we saw strong top-line growth in the Americas of 17% from last year, primarily from continued momentum in the hyperscale and co-location markets. More impressively, this growth was on top of a challenging comparison to second quarter 2023, where sales were up 48% from 2022. Adjusted operating margin in the Americas expanded 540 basis points to 25.4%, with the increase driven by favorable price cost and significant productivity. APAC sales increased 6% organically, with China slightly down, but more than offset by strong mid-team growth in India and the rest of Asia. We still characterize China as stable, but based upon visibility into an improving sales pipeline, we are optimistic that China will commence year-over-year growth in the second half. APAC adjusted operating margin decreased 180 basis points from last year, in part due to a discrete $6 million expense in this year's second quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, APAC operating margins are still 100 basis points higher than last year, despite this one-time expense, and we expect operating margins to increase in the back half of the year, correlated with the expected increase in second half volume. EMEA organic sales increased 14% in the second quarter, in part driven by strong modular solutions growth. We are certainly encouraged with the momentum in this part of the business, as customers increasingly use modular solutions to accelerate expansion of data center capacity. EMEA adjusted operating margin increased 480 basis points to 25.9%, as EMEA and Americas continue to compete for highest regional adjusted operating margins. So, EMEA won the quarter, but the Americas is ahead year-to-date, and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Moving to Slide nine, this slide summarizes our third quarter guidance. We are expecting a third quarter that looks largely consistent with second quarter, including organic sales growth of approximately 14% offset by a $20 million foreign exchange headwind. The regional sales growth profile is slightly different, with all three regions expected to grow in the low teens, which implies sequential acceleration in APAC, and notably China, as I referenced on the previous slide. We expect third quarter adjusted operating profit of $385 million at the midpoint, and adjusted operating margin of 19.6%, up 260 basis points from last year's third quarter, with expected benefits from operational leverage, price cost, and continued productivity gains. Next, turning to Slide 10, our full year guidance. After a strong first half, we are increasing the midpoint of our sales guidance by $50 million, including $75 million organically, partially offset by $25 million of incremental foreign exchange headwinds. Higher organic growth is primarily in the Americas and APAC. We are also increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operating profit guide by $85 million to $1.435 billion, due in part to higher volume, but also based upon higher expected variable contribution margin in the second half, driven by continued productivity, both in procurement and manufacturing. As a result, we are increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 18.7% at the midpoint, 100 basis points higher than previous guidance and 200 basis points higher than initial full year expectations from our November investor conference. Now, some analysts will likely inquire why year-over-year incrementals are not projected to stay above 60% for the second half as they were in the first half, and in short, year-over-year variable contribution margin comparisons are more challenging in the back half of the year as our productivity initiatives accelerated in the last two quarters in 2023. In addition, we anticipate a ramp-up of fixed costs in this year's back half as we continue to prioritize investment in capacity and technology. The 18.7% full-year adjusted operating margin guidance propels us closer to our long-term target of 20% plus. Certainly, this long-term target is within range, and we expect to exit the fourth quarter near that level, which sets a good foundation for 2025. Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.50 at the midpoint is more than 40% higher than 2023, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit. Like last quarter, we do provide additional information on income taxes and share count in the appendix. Finally, for me on this slide, we increased adjusted free cash flow guidance by $50 million to $875 million, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and partially offset by higher income taxes and additional investment in trade work and capital. Our full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance implies approximately $440 million of cash generation in the second half, which we expect to be relatively uniform in the third and fourth quarters. And with that said, I turn it back over to Gino.\nGio Albertazzi: Well, thank you. Thank you very much, David. And a quick summary here as we go to Slide 11. So I'm very pleased with our strong first half performance. The executional strength of Vertiv continues to improve, and we see that translating into our financial performance, including sales growth, profitability, and free cash flow. It gives us confidence to raise guidance again for 2024 and continues to strengthen our view on the next year. The market is evolving and becoming more critical, and that plays into Vertiv's strengths very well. Technology, global scale, portfolio breadth and depth, services, these attributes matter to our customers. We stay humble and focused. Every day we work hard to enforce our competitive advantages. I said that on the last call, we fully intend to keep winning. We are in a good place now. We can always do better. There is absolutely no room for complacency. We are making substantial progress, but our full potential is much bigger and keeps growing, and the entire Vertiv team is very excited about this. An important point on this Slide, we plan to have an investor event on November 18th in conjunction with Supercompute24. So more details on this will follow, but I want to make sure that this is on your calendars and radar screens. With that, Brica, over to you for the Q&A. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, Gio. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have the first question on the phone lines from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. You may proceed, Amit.\nAmit Daryanani: I'll speak to the one question rule. I'm wondering if you could just help us frame the order trajectory expected in September quarter. Will you help us understand maybe what's driving the deceleration in September to being 10% to 15% versus the high 50%, 60% we saw in the first half. And then crucially, just how do you see these orders converting to revenues over time for the company? It would be really helpful to frame that as well.\nGio Albertazzi: Thank you, Amit, and very good day to you. I think I stated at the end in the script, we are happy with the pipelines that we see. And those pipelines, of course, are reflecting a positive trajectory for the market and our overall view of the market continues to be positive. If you go back to April, we had certainly a more prudent view of the Q2 orders, but there are a lot of big orders and individual [peers] [ph] in this market. And sometimes, can be a question of timing whether they happen in one quarter or another or another quarter. So overall, our view of the market continues to be very positive, very, very positive. We're very happy about the trajectory of orders so far, but we are also aware of the fact that the timing can be an element here, all the timing. That's why we want to make sure that we do not just talk about orders in one quarter, but we took a little bit kind of a broader metric like the trailing 12 month that we have introduced now. When it comes to the second part of your question about order timing and translation in revenue. It's pretty much what we what we said last time already, for the upper part of the market, meaning that the larger part of the market, larger doses of the Cloud and Colocation. We are thinking now in terms of 12, 18 months on average can be very specific, individual orders can have different dynamics. But on average, we think about an elongation that we already described last time around. And hence, considering Q2 and Q3, the majority of that will sit in future years, so 2025 and beyond. But again, nothing particularly strange or different than what we observed before already.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nSteve Tusa: You mentioned the 30% to 35% trailing 12 months. Is that a good trend to think about here going forward given how positive you are in any comments on how the pipeline is trending year-over-year? And then just lastly, as a follow-up to that on orders, how do you book like campuses or like a phased order where you may be working on 3 buildings or something or 3 data centers in a certain campus and you may be contracted to do all of that. At what point do you actually book that order? Is it booked all at once? Or as the shovel goes into the ground. Thanks for any color on all of that.\nGio Albertazzi: Thank you for your question. So certainly, we call a 30%, 35% trailing 12, a strong trajectory and one that can sustain our growth long term. So we certainly like that range a lot and it's a range that reflects strength in the market for Vertiv. To your question about how we book campuses, I've been vocal about the fact is very, very important to be in the first part of a campus or a development as that capacity gets expanded over time. But the way, we do is PO-by-PO, there's no other way. We get a PO, we built a PO. And we called an order only what is actually truly legally binding. So it's really about what customers order actually from us.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: So I want to spend some more time on orders just because I think this is a big investor concern and what kind of reflected in the market today. So I guess the assumption that you get to 10% to 15% growth in the third quarter implies like a 20% step down sequentially. Like what is that founded in? Are you guys just kind of making a conservative assumption that, hey, we've had a few quarters of really strong large project orders and that may not continue. And then, are you actually seeing like large orders in the pipeline start to diminish because you've booked so many large orders? Just trying to get a sense of how you come to that 10% to 15% growth year-on-year. And if we could be sitting here 3 months from now with another positive surprise from an order perspective. Thank you.\nGio Albertazzi: Well, thank you for the question, Nicole. Certainly a little bit paradoxical to think that the concern is orders are concerned after 2 quarters of almost 60% year-on-year. But I hear you. As I said, the pipeline continues to be strong. And again, the pipeline reflects the dynamics of the market and a testament to a very strong visibility that we have in the market commercially and are just the way we understand the market. But again, the message is not different than the message that we gave, if you will, a quarter ago. It's just that it's that message with more good news on top of that as the good news is strength in the second quarter actual orders. So I continue to be very, very optimistic about the way the market is evolving and our position in the market. We like the trajectory of our pipelines. And we like also the way pipelines are shaping up in the rest of the world. Of course, we know that's very, very strong in the Americas. So AI dynamics are playing in a favorable manner. That said, again, sometimes receiving an order, the kind of first day of the quarter or the last day of the quarter can swing things around. So again, let's not be too obsessed about the individual quarter, it is important. We are very proud about what we printed in second quarter and let's make sure that we keep an eye on the trajectory on the long-term trajectory and the long-term trajectory is very strong.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs on the line.\nMark Delaney: Yes. Thank you so much for taking my question which is on pricing. Vertiv have been expecting a bit more than $60 million of net price cost positivity for this year. Can you speak just qualitatively on how the pricing environment has evolved? And are you seeing that pricing become any more competitive in new programs that come up for bid, given increased competition in certain parts of the industry? And if so, is that potentially limiting the degree of price cost positivity over the longer term? Thank you.\nGio Albertazzi: Absolutely. We continue to operate in a market that is favorable from a demand and supply balance standpoint. We have very strong competitive advantages in the market, so we feel good about what we're doing. We feel very good about the pricing muscles and muscle and pricing strength that we have built over the last 2, 3 years. So things continue to be encouraging in that respect. Of course, we operate in an environment that is mature as a market. Our customers are sophisticated players. So we continue to be adamant about the fact that our price cost equation will continue to be positive in the future, and we feel good about our position in the market and our ability to price the value that we deliver in terms of technology, in terms of service level, in terms of access to capacity to our customers.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: David, you talked a lot more about productivity. And so maybe Gio or David, you could talk a little bit more about the opportunities you see there. Is there any risk that you could lose any of those productivity improvements as you continue to ramp in areas such as liquid cooling? And then if there is a lot of room on the productivity side, pricing is still improving, you keep leveraging double-digit revenue. Could you end up with a margin way higher than that 20% target you have for '26?\nGio Albertazzi: I would say this is certainly premature. We know that, that 20% has always been a 20% plus not necessarily silly. We are very happy about the trajectory we're on right now. But quite adamantly, and we've been vocal about that forever and certainly in the introductory comments here, far from full potential. But when we look at the way, for example, liquid cooling is ramping up the way to top line is heading as reflected in the current guidance, et cetera, all elements that play in favor of us being able to be more effective in achieving our efficiency, leveraging volume, et cetera. So I'd say that productivity is a big element in our value equation, not the soul, of course, but an important one. And what we see happening in terms of business trajectory, but also internally, the improvements and the gains that we see being realized are encouraging in that direction. But again, we are certainly operating the company much better. There is so much more we can do. And that will be our forever mantra no matter how strong we can be.\nOperator: We now have Scott Davis with Melius Research.\nScott Davis: Good morning. You devoted a whole slide you devoted all slide to service. So obviously, you think there's a lot of potential here. I guess my question is kind of what is the key KPI here? Can you price around kind of guaranteed uptime? Is it just having field service guys on site, you can just price of that labor. I mean what is kind of the value to you guys and to the customer, I guess, more explicitly, I know it's kind of a big topic overall, but it wasn't 100% clear to me off the slide. And then also just the potential, I mean, if you devote all slide to it, clearly, you think it can become pretty material pretty, I would assume by 2025. So anyway, I know there's a lot there, just answer what you want, and I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nGio Albertazzi: Yes. I think certainly, a question that we deserve a market-positive conversation. I'll try to go to what are the key metrics here. I think there are two dimensions to that. One is for us, clearly, recurrent revenue is an important aspect having a large installed base and being able to attach to that installed base. So all things that we measure obsessively and we track and we make sure that we operate very well from a commercial but also kind of a delivery standpoint. So I call our service business very mature in that sense. And clearly, with the current revenue with the attach rates, it's quite valuable quite valuable set of revenue that delivers for us in terms of margins and profitability. But there is another element of help for us that is a service being a differentiator. That makes a difference in plays a very important role in our market share. Product project solutions market share, let's say, equation and competitive advantages. So it is very, very important in that respect. As I mentioned, when we were going through the slides, the importance of service is enormous for our customers, and we are very proud been able to support the industry with that. The example that I made very, very -- let's say, at a high level, obviously, given the time constraints when we were going through the slide is a liquid cooling system. So here, we have probably a $2 million rack that is kept alive, if you will by a secondary so-called liquid cooled circuit. And there is an inertia on that, that is in second. So differently from the past, when you would have an entire room helping if something goes wrong in a thermal system. Here, you have your CDU and your two or multiple $2 million racks. So you have to be able to see things before they happen and when you see something be able to intervene in second. So the value is really the utilization and the resilience of our customers' infrastructure. It is enormously important. There is an element as well as another element is enabling deployment. And especially as technologies become more complex as they are, everything that is project commissioning, et cetera, is of an increasingly impactful importance.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Elias with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nMichael Elias: When I look at the underlying data center market, I see that supply and demand are meaningfully imbalanced. And when I take a look at spot data center market pricing, I see it's up about 20% year-over-year over the last few years. Then when I drill that down into the unlevered yields that data center operators are generating, I mean, they're seeing yield expansion to the tune of 100 to 150 basis points year-over-year, which says to me that their returns are expanding faster than their cost to build and their cost of capital. So when we think through the price cost dynamic for Vertiv, my question for you is, should price grow linearly with the increase in underlying data center spot market pricing given that, that kind of price increase to the end customer would actually have no impact on their underlying returns. I just want to get a better sense of how to think about the relationship between data center price strength and your ability to price to the data center operators.\nGio Albertazzi: Well, I think it's really specific customer-by-customer and technology-by-technology, different technology may have a different profile of let's say, supply and demand balances. So it's hard to define general rule here. Certainly, what we see is in a market environment where vendors and especially a player like Vertiv with strong value proposition can translate that into value to our customers and translate that into price. Now all we'll, of course, go through all the aspects of your question and further reflect on that. But I'd say that we continue to operate in an environment that is favorable but with players that are certainly very savvy, especially large colos and hyperscalers in their, let's say, buying dynamics.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: I was wondering if we could just maybe put a finer point on share and how you're measuring it. Obviously, there's a lot of concerns about competition. You've heard before you're hearing on the call. But when we look at your order growth rate and the like, it doesn't appear to me there's a share issue. But you did mention you believe you're gaining share. So I wonder if you could just tell us how you're measuring that? How fast do you think the market is growing? Are you thinking about the answer to this question in terms of dollars per megawatt or some other metric? And just help us get a little more comfortable with how your business is performing relative to the competitive set.\nGio Albertazzi: Certainly, well, thank you for your question, Jeff, first of all. Certainly, our order trajectory is encouraging from the point of view of the signals that it gives us in terms of market share. There are parts of the market that are relatively new as well there are parts of the markets that are quite mature in terms of adding access to all the market information. So again, the answer should be specific to the technology. But in general, if we think about what we gave in November in terms of growth of the Cloud/Colocation in the 14%, 17%, of course, our orders are encouraging. Market share is always something that is a little bit measured ex post but the trajectory we are on certainly suggests that the outlook is positive in that respect. You were asking as well about dollars per megawatt, let's say, vision or thoughts right now at this stage, not very different from what we shared with all of you in the past. So I think, again, the 2.53 non AI and [3, 3.5] [ph] million per megawatt of TAM for Vertiv in the AI space. So that is for us still valid, let's say, order magnitude.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to hand it back to Giordano Albertazzi, for some closing remarks.\nLynne Maxeiner: Yes, operator, I think we have time for a couple more questions. There's a few more in queue. Go ahead and take those.\nOperator: Absolutely, I apologize. We now have Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Thanks for saving that I was drowning. Wow, okay. Yes. So look, I would like to, I think, take Jeff's kind of line of thought a little bit differently. Obviously, I tend to agree with the view that your front-end capability service network is a big advantage. The other side of the coin is you've got a bunch of Asian server OEMs sort of trying to integrate around the server and they're there with CDUs, et cetera. Maybe just talk about their ability to do that. And maybe just maybe a bit more specifically, what sort of win rate are you seeing on liquid cooling right now?\nGio Albertazzi: Yes, I'll go back, thank you for your question and Nigel. And Again, as mentioned when we were going through the slides, it's not just about having a widget. It's about having, first of all, very strong technology as we do, but then having very strong controls that are an important part of the liquid especially CDU direct-to chip equation. Having the right manufacturing processes, the ability to scale and services. Clearly, we always evaluate our competitors very, very seriously. But when you think about the system integrators or other players in that space, we should not necessarily look at them as necessarily competitors. Very often, they pay a hybrid role, and they can be a route to market as well. So things are a little bit more nuanced then they may appear at the first glance. So when it comes to win rates, will not go with the details of the win rates at this stage. But I think it's important to say that we are very, very happy with the trajectory of orders and backlog that we have in the liquid cooling space across a concerned portfolio, but in particular, in the CDU space. Very, very, very happy. Yes, but I will not go into that at this stage.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: So with enterprise on-prem migration of workloads to the cloud, perhaps getting into a little bit more of a new equilibrium here. You mentioned an uptick in the outlook for enterprise in the Americas. To what extent was that contemplated in the sort of 3% to 5% outlook you gave at the November Investor Day. Could we potentially be seeing growth starting to pick up versus that rate and is that something that you're seeing in the pipeline currently?\nGio Albertazzi: Well, thanks for the question. Good point in the sense that when we talked about that 3% to 5%, we're saying that, that may be -- [indiscernible] augmented expanded by the implications of AI as AI matures and becomes more readable and not just on card and colo. So I'd say that it's early stage but we gave a different color for a reason on Slide 4, I think it was. And it is exactly that pipeline start to indicate that things may be better in the enterprise part of the market than we had in our November model. But it's yet a little bit premature within aspect so them of the model, but it's something that we do constantly. But, yes, we see positivity in the pipeline and certainly in the direction of a faster growth in enterprise and originally expected.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.\nSteve Tusa: Just a question on cash. Seasonally, you guys usually kind of flat from the second to third and then up nicely in the fourth. I know that there's some timing on down payments involved with the contract or the deferred revenue, however you want to call it. Why are you guys not expecting that this year? Is there some timing around that?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. I think there's timing. If you look at our advanced payments, and you can look at the deferred revenue line in the balance sheet, that was up $150 million in Q2 and not surprising based on the quantum of the orders we had in Q2. So effectively, that's a prepayment and that would impact the cash flow timing going forward. So I think I mentioned we would expect about $440 million for the rest of the year, and that should be pretty uniform. But similar to orders, there is an element of timing and lumpiness especially with some of these advanced payments. But I think we're comfortable with the 220 for Q3, Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: I just wanted to talk about the margins in APAC mainly. It's good to see the Americas and EMEA having this competition. Just wondering when APAC is going to get involved in this competition. So as we see the inflection in APAC coming through, what kind of incremental margin should we expect as we go over the next couple of years?\nDavid Fallon: Yes. I think if you look at APAC, they're probably not going to be an active participant in the regional high, and there's some market differences there, notably with China. But if you look on a year-to-date basis, even though they were down in Q2 and versus prior year and some of that driven by the one-time expense. But on a year-to-date basis, they're still 100 basis points higher than they were last year. We think that year-over-year variance will expand in the second half. And VOS principles work in APAC, just like they do in the Americas and EMEA. So we are doing the same things in APAC as we are doing in the rest in the world. And even though from a relative basis, maybe a step below APAC and America, we expect expansion of operating margins in APAC for the rest of the year and also going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. You may proceed.\nBrett Linzey: So you noted in the slides managing timing constraints around construction and power availability. I guess, is there a way to mention how much of the current backlog is permitted, resource, ready to break ground versus the portion that might be a little bit more data uncertain? Just trying to get a better sense for the visibility in the next year.\nGio Albertazzi: Thanks for your question. When we talk about permitting and power constraints, we talk about in general, the industry as a whole. So it's not something that necessarily is applicable to our backlog. We believe that what we have in backlog we're reflecting our customers' requested delivery dates already accounts for all those aspects. It could be a little bit kind of adjusting exactly when a given site is ready, but nothing unusual and nothing different than what has happened in the industry for 4 years. So if we go back to some of the expectations in the market for growth, a very, very strong double-digit growth in the industry and infrastructure in general, we've said and we said that already in our November Investor Day, say, hey, guys, there are, how can I say, aspects that are influencing factors that are reducing this exuberance to levels of market growth that, again, going back to what we were saying in the cloud and colocation is really, let's say, 15%, 16%, 17% CAGR. So growth rates that are very, very respectable in many, many respects. But no, my comment did not have to do with our backlog. Our backlog is based on the requested delivery dates that we get on the PO that we receive from our customers, and it could be a minimal adjustment depending on the needs. Hopefully, addressing your question and concern.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gio Albertazzi for any closing remarks.\nGio Albertazzi: Well, very good and thank you, Brica. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. A big thank you for your questions. And I'd first and foremost, I'd like to thank the Vertiv team for another quarter of strong performance. So really appreciate everyone's support and have a great rest of your day today.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending the presentation. You may now disconnect from the call.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Well, I am quite pleased with our continuing trend of very strong financial performance. As I think about what attracted me to Vertiv, it was a great position in a good industry. And fortunately, it turned into a great position in a great industry. There was a lot of work to do to get the business moving in a direction to consistently drive value and increase returns to shareholders. I have to say, Gio and his team have done an excellent job starting to unlock this potential. Initial signs of progress are evident in the financial metrics, strong audits and sales, and substantially increased profit and cash flow. A better operating company delivers better results. It's an interesting time both in our industry and the world at large. Significant change is underway for both. The industry is rapidly expanding and evolving, and Vertiv is well positioned to strengthen its market leadership with increasing R&D and capacity expansions to further distinguish our unique position as an industry leader. We're gaining market share in a rapidly growing industry as a result of our new products and significantly improved operations. At the same time, we're strengthening the resilience of our organization. 2024 is shaping up to be a great year and sets a very strong foundation for future years to deliver sustained value creation. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."

            "name": "David Fallon",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Gio, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide seven, this slide summarizes our second quarter financial results. Our organic net sales increased approximately 14%, slightly above the high end of our guidance, primarily driven by, once again, strong performance in the Americas where organic sales were up 17% from prior year. Adjusted operating profit of $382 million was $131 million higher than last year, driven by the higher volume and improved variable contribution margin, which benefited from both year-over-year price cost and significant productivity gains. This improved productivity, which has been catalyzed by the continued implementation of VOS principles in our plants and within our functions and notably procurement, was the primary driver for the $57 million beat versus the midpoint of guidance and also a primary driver for the 510 basis points increase in adjusted operating margin to 19.6%. Just 40 basis points short of our long-term target. We are seeing the benefits of an intense focus on operational execution across all parts of the business, and the exciting thing is that there's still a lot more to do, so please stay tuned. Moving to the right, our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67, $0.21 higher than last year, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit. We generated $333 million of adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, over $100 million better than last year, primarily due to higher profitability and improved working capital, which declined to 17.1% of annualized second quarter sales. Some of this trade working capital improvement was due to favorable timing, including with advanced payments, which effectively shifted cash into the second quarter from the third and fourth quarters. Nonetheless, good progress with cash flow and working capital, but just like margins, still a lot more to do. Finally, on this page, net leverage was 1.8x at the end of the quarter within our stated leverage target range of 1x to 2x, and liquidity strengthened to $1.2 billion. Our balance sheet is strong and should remain strong based upon our expectations for free cash flow as we focus on flexibility to evaluate capital deployment opportunities. Turning to Page eight, this slide summarizes our second quarter segment results. As mentioned, we saw strong top-line growth in the Americas of 17% from last year, primarily from continued momentum in the hyperscale and co-location markets. More impressively, this growth was on top of a challenging comparison to second quarter 2023, where sales were up 48% from 2022. Adjusted operating margin in the Americas expanded 540 basis points to 25.4%, with the increase driven by favorable price cost and significant productivity. APAC sales increased 6% organically, with China slightly down, but more than offset by strong mid-team growth in India and the rest of Asia. We still characterize China as stable, but based upon visibility into an improving sales pipeline, we are optimistic that China will commence year-over-year growth in the second half. APAC adjusted operating margin decreased 180 basis points from last year, in part due to a discrete $6 million expense in this year's second quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, APAC operating margins are still 100 basis points higher than last year, despite this one-time expense, and we expect operating margins to increase in the back half of the year, correlated with the expected increase in second half volume. EMEA organic sales increased 14% in the second quarter, in part driven by strong modular solutions growth. We are certainly encouraged with the momentum in this part of the business, as customers increasingly use modular solutions to accelerate expansion of data center capacity. EMEA adjusted operating margin increased 480 basis points to 25.9%, as EMEA and Americas continue to compete for highest regional adjusted operating margins. So, EMEA won the quarter, but the Americas is ahead year-to-date, and we'll see how the rest of the year plays out. Moving to Slide nine, this slide summarizes our third quarter guidance. We are expecting a third quarter that looks largely consistent with second quarter, including organic sales growth of approximately 14% offset by a $20 million foreign exchange headwind. The regional sales growth profile is slightly different, with all three regions expected to grow in the low teens, which implies sequential acceleration in APAC, and notably China, as I referenced on the previous slide. We expect third quarter adjusted operating profit of $385 million at the midpoint, and adjusted operating margin of 19.6%, up 260 basis points from last year's third quarter, with expected benefits from operational leverage, price cost, and continued productivity gains. Next, turning to Slide 10, our full year guidance. After a strong first half, we are increasing the midpoint of our sales guidance by $50 million, including $75 million organically, partially offset by $25 million of incremental foreign exchange headwinds. Higher organic growth is primarily in the Americas and APAC. We are also increasing the midpoint of our adjusted operating profit guide by $85 million to $1.435 billion, due in part to higher volume, but also based upon higher expected variable contribution margin in the second half, driven by continued productivity, both in procurement and manufacturing. As a result, we are increasing our adjusted operating margin guidance to 18.7% at the midpoint, 100 basis points higher than previous guidance and 200 basis points higher than initial full year expectations from our November investor conference. Now, some analysts will likely inquire why year-over-year incrementals are not projected to stay above 60% for the second half as they were in the first half, and in short, year-over-year variable contribution margin comparisons are more challenging in the back half of the year as our productivity initiatives accelerated in the last two quarters in 2023. In addition, we anticipate a ramp-up of fixed costs in this year's back half as we continue to prioritize investment in capacity and technology. The 18.7% full-year adjusted operating margin guidance propels us closer to our long-term target of 20% plus. Certainly, this long-term target is within range, and we expect to exit the fourth quarter near that level, which sets a good foundation for 2025. Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.50 at the midpoint is more than 40% higher than 2023, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit. Like last quarter, we do provide additional information on income taxes and share count in the appendix. Finally, for me on this slide, we increased adjusted free cash flow guidance by $50 million to $875 million, primarily driven by higher adjusted operating profit and partially offset by higher income taxes and additional investment in trade work and capital. Our full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance implies approximately $440 million of cash generation in the second half, which we expect to be relatively uniform in the third and fourth quarters. And with that said, I turn it back over to Gino. Yes. I think there's timing. If you look at our advanced payments, and you can look at the deferred revenue line in the balance sheet, that was up $150 million in Q2 and not surprising based on the quantum of the orders we had in Q2. So effectively, that's a prepayment and that would impact the cash flow timing going forward. So I think I mentioned we would expect about $440 million for the rest of the year, and that should be pretty uniform. But similar to orders, there is an element of timing and lumpiness especially with some of these advanced payments. But I think we're comfortable with the 220 for Q3, Q4. Yes. I think if you look at APAC, they're probably not going to be an active participant in the regional high, and there's some market differences there, notably with China. But if you look on a year-to-date basis, even though they were down in Q2 and versus prior year and some of that driven by the one-time expense. But on a year-to-date basis, they're still 100 basis points higher than they were last year. We think that year-over-year variance will expand in the second half. And VOS principles work in APAC, just like they do in the Americas and EMEA. So we are doing the same things in APAC as we are doing in the rest in the world. And even though from a relative basis, maybe a step below APAC and America, we expect expansion of operating margins in APAC for the rest of the year and also going forward."

            "name": "Gio Albertazzi",
            "content": "Well, thank you. Thank you, Dave. And we go to Slide three. We had a very strong first half of 2024. Q2 organic sales were up 14% led by Americas, with strong growth in EMEA as well. We continue to see very strong orders growth, up 57% year-on-year, and up 10% sequentially from a very high level in Q1. Book-to-bill remains very high as well, with Q2 at 1.4x. More discussion to follow on this point on Slide five. Pipeline velocity has continued to increase and we are seeing the acceleration in large orders. The same dynamics we shared with you in April are continuing for large orders. Customers require longer delivery dates than in the past. Hence, a lot of the orders are creating backlog in 25 and beyond. Adjusted operating profit was $382 million and adjusted operating margins expanded 510 basis points to 19.6%. As Dave mentioned, better operating companies deliver better results. Our adjusted free cash flow is another good story, generating $333 million in the second quarter. We are converting our profitability to very good cash flow performance. Our net leverage was 1.8x at the end of Q2, so well within our targeted range of 1 to 2x. We again raised our full year guidance across all financial metrics and expect organic growth of 13%, adjusted operating profit of $1.435 billion, with margin expanding to 18.7%, and adjusted free cash flow of $875 million, up $50 million from previous guidance. Let's go to Slide four now. You may recognize this slide. We wanted to use it once again to give a directional indication of what we are seeing in the market. By and large, the market remains quite healthy and we see the continued acceleration of infrastructure built out in hyperscale and colo markets. High-density and liquid-cooled chips are a reality, and this accelerates the demand for AI infrastructure. We see this happening in the Americas, but also starting in EMEA and Asia, with some positive market signs for co-location and cloud in China as well. Enterprise remains stable, yet we expect to see AI positively impact enterprise over time, and this is starting in the Americas. Telecom remains subdued, as CapEx spending has yet to fully rebound. Commercial and industrial markets are healthy, as there is a lot of infrastructure spending happening in the Americas and APAC regions. So, overall, the market environment is encouraging, especially for data centers, which represent 75% of our end market exposure. We have heard feedback from investors about the data center market becoming a more conspicuous place these days from a competitive standpoint. This is true, but we believe we have competitive advantages that are tangible, quite unique, and being further reinforced. As data centers become more critical, I believe Vertiv becomes even more distinguished. We are not selling only one point product or only one small part of, say, the thermal chain. We are selling the entire critical infrastructure for data center. With power and cool and service data centers, we provide complete solutions. We act as the connective tissue between IT and facilities in a data center. It is a rare position in the industry, born of over 50 years of experience. We don't think this is easily replicated, and our orders are a good representation of our customers' trust in Vertiv. Certainly, there is intense focus on the liquid cooling portion of the market, and understandably so at this moment. Our advantages are clear. We have a comprehensive portfolio of liquid cooling technologies, direct-to-chip, immersion, in-row CDUs, in-rack CDUs. We adore heat exchanges, and we know how to integrate these key technologies into the entire thermal chain solution. This differentiates Vertiv. We continue to see direct-to-chip as our customers' prevailing technology of choice, and we have a complete portfolio of technology solutions ready for deployment. Surrounding this is a global service organization with almost 4,000 field service engineers. We're talking minutes and hours to get to a customer site. It is very important to our customers to have local service support. So we see market participants emerging with point products in liquid cooling, a small part of the overall thermal solution for a bigger center, but they have a far different profile than Vertiv. And I would say we aspire to be an even bigger player in liquid cooling, and we have very good reasons to believe our ambition is indeed reasonable. So let's move to Slide five now. Another quarter of extremely strong order growth. Pipeline velocity increased, and we continue to see AI scaling, especially in the Americas. The strength of orders is across our portfolio. Power management and thermal management orders grew at very similar rates in Q2, and both convincingly strong. There is a strong correlation between power and cooling, and we would expect that balance of sales in our portfolio to continue over time. This quarter, we have introduced a trailing 12-month orders metric. As we have previously highlighted, there can be a natural variation to the timing of large orders in any quarter. Trailing 12-month is a good metric to assess order activity, smoothing some of the quarter-to-quarter push and pulls. We also know we have increasingly tough comparisons ahead, and we believe we still see low double-digit orders growth in the third quarter on a year-on-year basis, but we expect a sequential decline in orders from an extremely high second quarter. This is where the trailing 12-month order metric can be helpful, as we expect to stay in the 30s range, indicating a very healthy and strong order trend, supportive of our financial guidance. As mentioned, customer request dates elongated for large projects in the hyper and colo space in general, as the scale of deployments continue to increase. We view this as the industry wanting to manage this growth and technology transition in an orderly manner. As a consequence, a lot of the orders are for future years, and we feel good about how 2025 is shaping. Pipeline, orders, backlog, all three are positive in the same direction, and we like what we are seeing. Let's now look at the right side of Slide five. We continue to focus on resilience to navigate an increasingly complicated geopolitical environment. Multi-sourcing strategies, risk identification and mitigation plans are key to building supply chain resilience. Inflation, we believe it is here to stay, as mentioned a few times. We price with this in mind and have a good process and governance in place to stay price-cost positive. We continue to expand capacity, including adding more modular and thermal management capacity in the Americas. Besides the expansion plans we already shared with you across the other technologies. The ramp-up of liquid cooling production capacity globally continues, and it is quite encouraging. This technology is in three of our plants today, and we are on track to finish in 2024 with a 45x capacity increase compared to baseline at the end of 2023. So we are investing at the same time. As we are investing at the same time, Vertiv operating system continues to be a key driver to liberate footprint capacity to accommodate our growth trajectory. If the market grows faster, we will not constrain ourselves, and we are diligent as we look at different demand scenarios. We believe our capital expenditure forecast of between $175 million and $200 million will cover the scenarios needed to meet the demand trajectory. Let's now go to Slide six. You have heard us mention service as a differentiator and one not easily replicated. Service is one of our superpowers. It demonstrates we have been in the data center industry for decades. Service represents 23% of our total sales last year, and additionally, the service business has the financial characteristics you would expect, including a strong margin profile that has been expanding. We like this part of the business a lot, and it is uniquely strong for Vertiv. Service opportunity is proportional to the critical nature of the application. In an AI high-density world, criticality is increasing, and we believe service matters even more. The stakes are significantly higher. The value of each rack can be in the millions of dollars. The thermal management and power management systems are becoming more complex, and the nature of the load more unforgiving. Telemetry, predictive services, and an ability to have experts on site in minutes or hours is essential. We are training our global service engineers proactively to be a partner of choice to help our customers navigate this complexity. In fact, I'm absolutely thrilled to share an exciting use case where Compass data centers have chosen Vertiv to provide full-time site-based embedded Vertiv tools to do service management and predictive maintenance on some Compass data center sites. The scale of data center deployment is becoming much larger. The value of dedicated service personnel on site full-time is becoming absolutely compelling. We thank Compass for their trust in Vertiv. With that, over to you, David. Well, thank you. Thank you very much, David. And a quick summary here as we go to Slide 11. So I'm very pleased with our strong first half performance. The executional strength of Vertiv continues to improve, and we see that translating into our financial performance, including sales growth, profitability, and free cash flow. It gives us confidence to raise guidance again for 2024 and continues to strengthen our view on the next year. The market is evolving and becoming more critical, and that plays into Vertiv's strengths very well. Technology, global scale, portfolio breadth and depth, services, these attributes matter to our customers. We stay humble and focused. Every day we work hard to enforce our competitive advantages. I said that on the last call, we fully intend to keep winning. We are in a good place now. We can always do better. There is absolutely no room for complacency. We are making substantial progress, but our full potential is much bigger and keeps growing, and the entire Vertiv team is very excited about this. An important point on this Slide, we plan to have an investor event on November 18th in conjunction with Supercompute24. So more details on this will follow, but I want to make sure that this is on your calendars and radar screens. With that, Brica, over to you for the Q&A. Thank you very much. Thank you, Amit, and very good day to you. I think I stated at the end in the script, we are happy with the pipelines that we see. And those pipelines, of course, are reflecting a positive trajectory for the market and our overall view of the market continues to be positive. If you go back to April, we had certainly a more prudent view of the Q2 orders, but there are a lot of big orders and individual [peers] [ph] in this market. And sometimes, can be a question of timing whether they happen in one quarter or another or another quarter. So overall, our view of the market continues to be very positive, very, very positive. We're very happy about the trajectory of orders so far, but we are also aware of the fact that the timing can be an element here, all the timing. That's why we want to make sure that we do not just talk about orders in one quarter, but we took a little bit kind of a broader metric like the trailing 12 month that we have introduced now. When it comes to the second part of your question about order timing and translation in revenue. It's pretty much what we what we said last time already, for the upper part of the market, meaning that the larger part of the market, larger doses of the Cloud and Colocation. We are thinking now in terms of 12, 18 months on average can be very specific, individual orders can have different dynamics. But on average, we think about an elongation that we already described last time around. And hence, considering Q2 and Q3, the majority of that will sit in future years, so 2025 and beyond. But again, nothing particularly strange or different than what we observed before already. Thank you for your question. So certainly, we call a 30%, 35% trailing 12, a strong trajectory and one that can sustain our growth long term. So we certainly like that range a lot and it's a range that reflects strength in the market for Vertiv. To your question about how we book campuses, I've been vocal about the fact is very, very important to be in the first part of a campus or a development as that capacity gets expanded over time. But the way, we do is PO-by-PO, there's no other way. We get a PO, we built a PO. And we called an order only what is actually truly legally binding. So it's really about what customers order actually from us. Well, thank you for the question, Nicole. Certainly a little bit paradoxical to think that the concern is orders are concerned after 2 quarters of almost 60% year-on-year. But I hear you. As I said, the pipeline continues to be strong. And again, the pipeline reflects the dynamics of the market and a testament to a very strong visibility that we have in the market commercially and are just the way we understand the market. But again, the message is not different than the message that we gave, if you will, a quarter ago. It's just that it's that message with more good news on top of that as the good news is strength in the second quarter actual orders. So I continue to be very, very optimistic about the way the market is evolving and our position in the market. We like the trajectory of our pipelines. And we like also the way pipelines are shaping up in the rest of the world. Of course, we know that's very, very strong in the Americas. So AI dynamics are playing in a favorable manner. That said, again, sometimes receiving an order, the kind of first day of the quarter or the last day of the quarter can swing things around. So again, let's not be too obsessed about the individual quarter, it is important. We are very proud about what we printed in second quarter and let's make sure that we keep an eye on the trajectory on the long-term trajectory and the long-term trajectory is very strong. Absolutely. We continue to operate in a market that is favorable from a demand and supply balance standpoint. We have very strong competitive advantages in the market, so we feel good about what we're doing. We feel very good about the pricing muscles and muscle and pricing strength that we have built over the last 2, 3 years. So things continue to be encouraging in that respect. Of course, we operate in an environment that is mature as a market. Our customers are sophisticated players. So we continue to be adamant about the fact that our price cost equation will continue to be positive in the future, and we feel good about our position in the market and our ability to price the value that we deliver in terms of technology, in terms of service level, in terms of access to capacity to our customers. I would say this is certainly premature. We know that, that 20% has always been a 20% plus not necessarily silly. We are very happy about the trajectory we're on right now. But quite adamantly, and we've been vocal about that forever and certainly in the introductory comments here, far from full potential. But when we look at the way, for example, liquid cooling is ramping up the way to top line is heading as reflected in the current guidance, et cetera, all elements that play in favor of us being able to be more effective in achieving our efficiency, leveraging volume, et cetera. So I'd say that productivity is a big element in our value equation, not the soul, of course, but an important one. And what we see happening in terms of business trajectory, but also internally, the improvements and the gains that we see being realized are encouraging in that direction. But again, we are certainly operating the company much better. There is so much more we can do. And that will be our forever mantra no matter how strong we can be. Yes. I think certainly, a question that we deserve a market-positive conversation. I'll try to go to what are the key metrics here. I think there are two dimensions to that. One is for us, clearly, recurrent revenue is an important aspect having a large installed base and being able to attach to that installed base. So all things that we measure obsessively and we track and we make sure that we operate very well from a commercial but also kind of a delivery standpoint. So I call our service business very mature in that sense. And clearly, with the current revenue with the attach rates, it's quite valuable quite valuable set of revenue that delivers for us in terms of margins and profitability. But there is another element of help for us that is a service being a differentiator. That makes a difference in plays a very important role in our market share. Product project solutions market share, let's say, equation and competitive advantages. So it is very, very important in that respect. As I mentioned, when we were going through the slides, the importance of service is enormous for our customers, and we are very proud been able to support the industry with that. The example that I made very, very -- let's say, at a high level, obviously, given the time constraints when we were going through the slide is a liquid cooling system. So here, we have probably a $2 million rack that is kept alive, if you will by a secondary so-called liquid cooled circuit. And there is an inertia on that, that is in second. So differently from the past, when you would have an entire room helping if something goes wrong in a thermal system. Here, you have your CDU and your two or multiple $2 million racks. So you have to be able to see things before they happen and when you see something be able to intervene in second. So the value is really the utilization and the resilience of our customers' infrastructure. It is enormously important. There is an element as well as another element is enabling deployment. And especially as technologies become more complex as they are, everything that is project commissioning, et cetera, is of an increasingly impactful importance. Well, I think it's really specific customer-by-customer and technology-by-technology, different technology may have a different profile of let's say, supply and demand balances. So it's hard to define general rule here. Certainly, what we see is in a market environment where vendors and especially a player like Vertiv with strong value proposition can translate that into value to our customers and translate that into price. Now all we'll, of course, go through all the aspects of your question and further reflect on that. But I'd say that we continue to operate in an environment that is favorable but with players that are certainly very savvy, especially large colos and hyperscalers in their, let's say, buying dynamics. Certainly, well, thank you for your question, Jeff, first of all. Certainly, our order trajectory is encouraging from the point of view of the signals that it gives us in terms of market share. There are parts of the market that are relatively new as well there are parts of the markets that are quite mature in terms of adding access to all the market information. So again, the answer should be specific to the technology. But in general, if we think about what we gave in November in terms of growth of the Cloud/Colocation in the 14%, 17%, of course, our orders are encouraging. Market share is always something that is a little bit measured ex post but the trajectory we are on certainly suggests that the outlook is positive in that respect. You were asking as well about dollars per megawatt, let's say, vision or thoughts right now at this stage, not very different from what we shared with all of you in the past. So I think, again, the 2.53 non AI and [3, 3.5] [ph] million per megawatt of TAM for Vertiv in the AI space. So that is for us still valid, let's say, order magnitude. Yes, I'll go back, thank you for your question and Nigel. And Again, as mentioned when we were going through the slides, it's not just about having a widget. It's about having, first of all, very strong technology as we do, but then having very strong controls that are an important part of the liquid especially CDU direct-to chip equation. Having the right manufacturing processes, the ability to scale and services. Clearly, we always evaluate our competitors very, very seriously. But when you think about the system integrators or other players in that space, we should not necessarily look at them as necessarily competitors. Very often, they pay a hybrid role, and they can be a route to market as well. So things are a little bit more nuanced then they may appear at the first glance. So when it comes to win rates, will not go with the details of the win rates at this stage. But I think it's important to say that we are very, very happy with the trajectory of orders and backlog that we have in the liquid cooling space across a concerned portfolio, but in particular, in the CDU space. Very, very, very happy. Yes, but I will not go into that at this stage. Well, thanks for the question. Good point in the sense that when we talked about that 3% to 5%, we're saying that, that may be -- [indiscernible] augmented expanded by the implications of AI as AI matures and becomes more readable and not just on card and colo. So I'd say that it's early stage but we gave a different color for a reason on Slide 4, I think it was. And it is exactly that pipeline start to indicate that things may be better in the enterprise part of the market than we had in our November model. But it's yet a little bit premature within aspect so them of the model, but it's something that we do constantly. But, yes, we see positivity in the pipeline and certainly in the direction of a faster growth in enterprise and originally expected. Thanks for your question. When we talk about permitting and power constraints, we talk about in general, the industry as a whole. So it's not something that necessarily is applicable to our backlog. We believe that what we have in backlog we're reflecting our customers' requested delivery dates already accounts for all those aspects. It could be a little bit kind of adjusting exactly when a given site is ready, but nothing unusual and nothing different than what has happened in the industry for 4 years. So if we go back to some of the expectations in the market for growth, a very, very strong double-digit growth in the industry and infrastructure in general, we've said and we said that already in our November Investor Day, say, hey, guys, there are, how can I say, aspects that are influencing factors that are reducing this exuberance to levels of market growth that, again, going back to what we were saying in the cloud and colocation is really, let's say, 15%, 16%, 17% CAGR. So growth rates that are very, very respectable in many, many respects. But no, my comment did not have to do with our backlog. Our backlog is based on the requested delivery dates that we get on the PO that we receive from our customers, and it could be a minimal adjustment depending on the needs. Hopefully, addressing your question and concern. Well, very good and thank you, Brica. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. A big thank you for your questions. And I'd first and foremost, I'd like to thank the Vertiv team for another quarter of strong performance. So really appreciate everyone's support and have a great rest of your day today."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Jordan, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Vertiv's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded.\n I'd now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference call, Lynne Maxeiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. \nLynne Maxeiner: Great. Thank you, Jordan, and good morning and welcome to Vertiv's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today are Vertiv's Executive Chairman, Dave Cote; Chief Executive Officer, Gio Albertazzi; and Chief Financial Officer, David Fallon.\n Before we begin, I'd like to point out that during the course of this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events, including the future financial and operating performance of Vertiv. These forward-looking statements are subject to material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We refer you to the cautionary language included in today's earnings release, and you can learn more about these risks in our annual and quarterly reports and other filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n During this call, we will also present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP results and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release and in the investor slide deck found on our website at investors.vertiv.com.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Executive Chairman, Dave Cote. \nDavid Cote: Well, we're pleased to bring a very good morning to our investors. Our performance continues to strengthen. Demand is clearly accelerating, and we're well positioned to capture the growth and to deliver great returns for our investors. We demonstrated the flexibility of our capital deployment strategy, initiating an opportunistic share repurchase in the first quarter, and our current cash flow generation profile provides wonderful opportunity.\n We've made great progress, but our focus is on how much further we still have to go. Gio and the team are working process improvement everywhere. Hard work doesn't pay off with our results, so you will see the results in the orders and sales growth, profitability and cash generation. We intend to build a track record of consistency over many years.\n We're well positioned to further differentiate and gain competitive advantage with the technology shifts underway in the data center industry. Our goal is not just to be better than we were last year or the year before but to be better than everyone at serving our customers and running our business at world-class levels. Essential to accomplishing that is creating a high-performance culture. We can't be great without it. That high-performance culture is starting to take hold, and we are still very early on this journey.\n I'm excited about the year ahead. It started off strong. And I'm more excited about 2025 and beyond and the opportunity we have to continue to create tremendous shareholder value. We ain't done yet. I'm also enjoying my discussions with Gio. He in each meeting is saying, for my next trick, and it's working, and I'm enjoying it.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you very much, Dave, and good day, everyone. We go to Slide 3. And as Dave mentioned, we had a good start to 2024. Q1 sales were up 8%, and we saw high single-digit growth across the 3 regions. Our orders grew 60% year-on-year and 4% sequentially. More to come on Slide 4. This is an indicator of good market demand and of our very relevant market position.\n The strength in order drove a very strong Q1 book-to-bill at 1.5x. Important to note, most of the orders overage in Q1 is for deliveries beyond '24. Most of the acceleration comes from large orders, which typically have longer customer-requested lead times. Adjusted operating profit was $249 million, corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, a significant $73 million and 370 bps improvement year-on-year, which demonstrates we are progressing on our road map to operational excellence, as explained at our Investor Day. Our adjusted free cash flow was $101 million, an improvement of $76 million from Q1 last year.\n In Q1, we repurchased 9.1 million shares at an average weighted price of $66 a share. This included buying back approximately $8 million of the shares from Platinum Advisers as they exited their position in Vertiv. We deployed $600 million of cash to do those share repurchases. We believe it was a favorable time to do so. Our net leverage at the end of the first quarter ticked up slightly to 2.2x driven by the opportunistic share repurchase in Q1. Our '24 guidance suggests that we will return comfortably to our targeted 1x to 2x range as we make our way through the year.\n We again raised our full year guidance and expect full year '24 organic growth of 12% and adjusted operating margins to expand to 17.7%. Overall, good progress towards our long-term target of 20-plus percent. I am pleased with the start of the year, and I'm very encouraged by what we see in the data center market and now positioned within that.\n Let's go to Page -- Slide 4 now. As you may have noticed, we did not include the market environment slide this quarter. It becomes difficult to differentiate shades of color for market over very short periods of time, and our last call was just about 2 months ago. We will continue to provide a view on how we see the market in our future earnings releases material and in our accompanying remarks.\n Certainly, we have seen a very strong data center market environment, and we feel we have a unique vantage point: our profile of 75% data center exposure and our decades of experience serving the industry. It is an industry that has reliability at its core. And during times of technological transformation, as the one underway now with AI, our customers lean on the knowledge strength Vertiv can offer. Advanced technology, deep domain expertise, global scale, 24/7 local service globally, these are true differentiators we built over the decade serving the data center industry and understanding its truly unique requirements and not easy to replicate.\n So if we look at the left side of Slide 4, extremely strong order growth, as we said. Pipelines velocity clearly increased as evidenced by backlog being up $800 million in first quarter. This acceleration brought into Q1 some orders we expected for future periods. It is also clear that AI is starting to scale, and that's particularly true in the Americas. We already explained the accelerated dynamics of large projects. So no surprise that most of the impact is on future years. That gives us better visibility as we think about the years ahead. We anticipate orders will remain strong, but I want to caution 60% order growth is not the new expectation. We are -- there are reasons specific to Q1 that supported that very high level of order growth.\n For example, Q1 was our easiest comparison given that Q1 '23 orders were down 33% year-on-year. The comparison will get tougher as '24 progresses, and precise timing on orders can fluctuate. So while I don't want to suggest false precision, seeing orders down Q1 to Q2 sequentially would not be a surprise. It is expected and not particularly worsen given the very high absolute value of Q1 orders. We are anyway expecting good order growth year-on-year in Q2.\n Our book-to-bill of 1.5x is very strong. Also here, we're not anticipating that this is the new normal. We believe book-to-bill should remain above 1x throughout the year, which suggests the absolute dollar of orders we are anticipating remains at high levels given the sales guidance range we provided. How that looks quarter-to-quarter depends on multiple factors like pipeline velocity and now customers build schedules.\n On capacity. I'm comfortable with the investments we are making, and it will support our customers. As a reminder, we have 22 manufacturing plants globally. As explained in the past, we have stringently cadence spend rigorous process to manage further capacity expansion decisions. We previously provided a $75 million to $200 million range for CapEx this year. We expect to be at the high end of that range. So please assume $200 million CapEx in '24, still comfortably within the 2.5% to 3% range of sales we provided at our investor conference.\n The ramp-up of production of liquid cooling globally continues as planned, and I'm happy to report we have production underway already at 2 of the 3 plants we shared with you we were planning to activate in '24. We are on track with the capacity ramp-up as shared in February. We continue to see strong momentum with AI-related orders. While we are not disclosing specific detail on our liquid cooling orders, or more broadly AI-related orders, we did see the pipeline for AI projects more than double in the last 2 months.\n We are starting to see AI scaling in North America. This is consistent with the GPU road maps, whereby next-generation chips will require liquid cooling. The pipeline is reflecting that technology shift, not only in terms of liquid cooling but in terms of the whole powertrain and thermal chain. We are working closely with our customers to get their infrastructure ready for what is ahead.\n Now to the right side of Slide 4 still. Supply chains continue to operate as expected, not without an occasional bump, but that's where our constantly improving supply chain resilience comes into play. We continue to build out our supply chain to support deployment of liquid cooling technology with the same rigor and resilience we have built in our existing supply chain. The geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. We are working to constantly increase the resilience of our business. Looking at material inflation, a mixed bag, but we know things can change quickly. We continue to believe we are in an inflationary world, and the price/cost plans we're executing reflect that yet.\n Let's now turn to Slide 5. There is an intense focus on thermal management lately and rightfully so. As the market leader in data center cooling, we are uniquely positioned for that opportunity. But power is also very central to the evolution of data center design and to enable AI deployment and to fuel the overall market acceleration.\n Vertiv has a complete power offering, the whole powertrain to serve the data center market. We are quite relevant in both the power distribution and power quality segments of the data center market. The acquisition of E&I expanded the Vertiv portfolio to include medium-voltage switchgear, low-voltage switchgear and busway offering.\n We often get asked about capacity. We talked about liquid cooling in February. We want to spend a minute on power now. We are expanding our operational capacity significantly across the powertrain to support customer demand. A good example are busbars and switchgears. We have already doubled our capacity since we acquired E&I at the end of '21, and we are on track to double it again by the end of '25 to support the growth we see ahead.\n You heard me talk about always maintaining a circa 25% capacity we have room to cover demand peaks. This on average continues to be the way we manage capacity. The ability to operate end-to-end across the powertrain similar to what we do with a thermal chain is testament to Vertiv having the most complete digital infrastructure solution. This is an important reason why we are a partner of choice for our customers and work with them on designing the infrastructure for the high-density future.\n And with that, David, over to you. \nDavid Fallon: Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our first quarter financial results, strong performance to start the year. Organic net sales increased 8% with all 3 regions growing relatively consistently in the high single digits. Sales were above the high end of guidance with EMEA, the primary driver of that overperformance.\n Adjusted operating profit of $249 million was $73 million higher than last year's first quarter mainly due to favorable price/cost and higher volume. We exceeded the high end of guidance driven by the sales beat and higher productivity than expected in our model. Our adjusted operating margin increased 370 basis points to 15.2%, further demonstrating our continued focus on operational excellence, and that is certainly driving results. But as we have mentioned, still plenty of opportunity and much to do.\n Moving to the right. Our first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.43, $0.19 higher than last year, primarily driven by the higher adjusted operating profit and also a small tailwind from income taxes. On the far right, adjusted free cash flow was $101 million for the quarter, which was 4x higher than last year's first quarter with the higher profitability flowing through to free cash flow. As Gio mentioned, net leverage was 2.2x at the end of the quarter. And despite the $600 million share repurchase, net leverage is only slightly higher than the 1.9x at year-end as we continue to expand EBITDA while generating cash. And based on forward expectations, we anticipate net leverage to decline to 2x or lower in the third quarter, if not sooner.\n As mentioned, the $600 million, 9.1 million share repurchase in the quarter included $525 million and approximately 8 million shares from Platinum as they exited their position. All in, we repurchased shares at an average price of $66, which looks pretty good at this point.\n Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. We had relatively balanced growth across the regions. Americas grew 7% driven by hyperscale and colocation. And this growth was on top of an extremely challenging comparison to first quarter 2023, where Americas grew over 60% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Americas expanded 340 basis points from last year's first quarter to 20.3% with the increase primarily driven by favorable price/cost and also productivity.\n APAC sales increased 9% organically, a stronger number than we have seen in this region in quite a while with this growth driven by continued strong market demand in India and the rest of Asia with both those subregions growing low double digits. Although not as strong as the rest of the region, China sales grew low single digits in the quarter, encouraging. But as we see China stabilizing, albeit at low levels, and we expect China growth to remain stable but muted throughout 2024.\n APAC adjusted operating margin increased 380 points driven by fixed cost leverage and improved contribution margin in China as we continue to focus on costs given the market headwinds there. EMEA grew 10% organically, which was higher than anticipated, partially driven by strength with switchgear and busbar. EMEA adjusted operating margin expanded 510 basis points to 18.4% driven by fixed cost leverage and improved contribution margin both from price cost and productivity. Corporate costs of $40 million increased $7 million from last year's first quarter primarily driven by a onetime benefit last year. For the full year, we expect corporate costs to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million.\n Next, moving to Slide 8. This is a look at our second quarter guidance. We are expecting organic sales growth of approximately 12% with Americas up mid-teens, APAC high single digits and EMEA low double digits. We anticipate an $18 million year-over-year foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most foreign currencies over the last several months. We expect second quarter adjusted operating profit between $315 million and $335 million and adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 240 basis points at the midpoint with expected benefits from price/cost partially offset by continued growth investments.\n Next, turning to Slide 9, our full year '24 guidance. Based upon a favorable start to the year and visibility into a strong sales pipeline for the rest of the year, we are increasing estimates for organic sales growth from 10% at the midpoint to approximately 12% with higher expectations across all 3 regions. In addition, we are increasing the midpoint of adjusted operating profit guidance from $1.3 billion in our prior guidance to $1.35 billion primarily driven by contribution margin on incremental sales. And as a result, we are increasing midpoint guidance for adjusted operating margin to 17.7% with the primary driver there being fixed cost leverage.\n The 17.7% full year adjusted operating margin guidance demonstrates our continued relentless focus on operational improvement across the business and is a stepping stone on our path to 20%-plus. But as always, pleased but never satisfied. Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.32 at the midpoint represents an over 30% increase compared to last year, and that's primarily driven by the higher adjusted operating profit.\n Now there is some noise in our adjusted EPS and effective tax rate calculations for the first quarter and also for full year, to a lesser extent. And those are primarily driven by accounting requirements around the $177 million first quarter charge from change in fair value of warrant liabilities. And instead of investing valuable time on this call, we provided additional information on Slides 21 and 22 in the appendix, and we'll be more than happy to answer questions and review this information with analysts and investors after this call.\n And finally, moving to the far right on this slide. We are holding the midpoint of our adjusted free cash flow guidance at $825 million, which is approximately 92% free cash flow conversion for the year as we expect higher adjusted operating profit to be offset by higher taxes, higher net cash interest as we use cash for first quarter share repurchases. And as Gio mentioned, we are increasing our full year estimate for CapEx to $200 million to further support capacity for future growth.\n And with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you, David. Let's go to Slide 10. I was at the Data Center World Conference last week. I would say the excitement was absolutely palpable. So very clear signals from the data center market when it comes to demand. Our thought leadership was on display in power, thermal and specifically liquid cooling as we shared insights and collaborated with some of the industry's technology leaders, collaborated to chart the road map for the future of digital infrastructure.\n We value -- the value of know-how strength in serving this market today is unprecedented in my long industry experience. We like that a lot as we become more central to the enablement of AI deployment. We are scaling our global capacity to match the ambitions of the industry. And you need broad shoulders to keep up with that pace. We are moving fast and mobilizing around the globe.\n Our ability to continue to execute well is grounded in the high-performance culture we are creating and in the Vertiv Operating System we are continuing to deploy. The intensity of what we do is rapidly increasing, and the organization, let's continue to do things right and fast. This is the expectation I am driving every single day with a relentless focus and holding the entire Vertiv team, and me in the first place, accountable to deliver results. So the winners will be determined by their portfolio and their strength of execution. I believe you may, we fully intend to keep winning.\n With that said, over to you, Jordan, for the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Sprague: I wonder, Gio, if you could just give us a little bit more color on how -- just kind of the AI complexion is playing out as it relates to your suite of products. You've said in the past it's early days, and it's a bit early to know what really changes in your customers' configurations and the like. Is there anything that you would point out or add incremental from your kind of general opening comments there? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Jeff, thank you for the question. So as I said, we see an acceleration that is certainly quite convincing in the whole AI space. When I was referring to doubling pipeline side in the last 2 months, that in and of itself is a very strong signal. The type of demand that we see is certainly around liquid cooling. And when we think liquid cooling, we think something that is consistent with the capacity curve that we gave a couple of months back. \n But truly, the demand is across the board. It's across the board in terms of the entirety of the powertrain and thermal chain. So just like we were expecting, there are some technologies that are specific to high-density compute or anyway GPU-based compute, but there is a market demand expansion that is simply more megawatts being deployed that is impacting the entire range. Again, it's not just one piece of the portfolio. It's the entire range. It's still early in many respects for the industry, and the industry and the design of future -- exact structure is still unfolding, but we are pleased to be able to follow our customers and to support our customer across the entire spectrum of their decision structurally. \nJeffrey Sprague: And then just kind of widening the lens on supply chain. So it sounds like yours is where you need it to be. I'm sure you're working hard to keep it that way. But just kind of the general big picture here, Gio, in terms of site preparation, craft labor, utility feeds to deliver these megawatts and the like. What are you seeing or hearing from the field in terms of the ability to kind of drive revenues higher kind of into '25 and '26? It seems like the demand is there, right? My question is really about being able to put the product in the ground. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Jeff, I'll be very brief considering the second question. The situation has not dramatically changed from what we were saying -- we were seeing last time. Again, the industry is growing. Could there be kind of a bigger growth in absolute terms? Yes, but let's not forget that this is about building data center. This is about getting permits and getting power. So there is a lot, of course, of public also debate about this. So I'll reference to that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess, Gio, I was hoping you could put some context around [Technical Difficulty]... \nOperator: Amit, your line has -- you still there? Amit, please go ahead. \nAmit Daryanani: Hopefully, you can hear me well. \nGiordano Albertazzi: We can hear you now. \nAmit Daryanani: All right. Perfect. Gio, I guess my question was really around the order growth number at 60% is extremely impressive and I get the compares a bit easier. But nonetheless, I was wondering if you could talk about how much of this growth do you think is driven by the duration kind of expanding versus unit uptick that's happening. Is there a way to think about those 2 metrics? And then as you think about these orders really becoming revenues, should we start to think about revenue growth accelerating versus your longer-term targets in '25 and beyond at this point? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, good one. Amit, thank you for the question. Certainly, we're very happy about our order number. The majority of the order overage, let's say, as I was saying in -- when we were going through the slides is indeed and the majority of the acceleration is coming from large projects, indeed. And what we have seen in the large projects, that there has been some extension, if you will, of the requested lead time or delivery date.\n So in the past, I was more talking about a 9- to 18-month window in terms of the requested delivery. Now this -- what we are serving is a little bit longer. So think in terms of 12, 18 months or so. That has been a little bit of a window of coverage changing behind us. But it's good. I mean we have more visibility of what our customers do, and that gives us the possibility to execute even more orderly and punctually, if you will, on everything and align supply chain.\n What does that mean in terms of the future years? It's probably premature. But again, while we stick still to the conversation we had at Investor Day in terms of the general dynamics of the market, what we see today is on the -- is fairly on the upper end of the ranges that we shared with you. So positive in that respect. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Just a question on the market, I guess. What's your -- you guys cover a lot here, and you talked to all the consultants, I mean, what's your estimate of like the kind of quarterly rate of gigawatt adds for the industry here in the U.S., the kind of the run rate we're at just roughly? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, look, going into this detail would be given an updated view of what we shared with you back in -- at the end of November. So I will go back to comments I made answering, Amit. So we see that the projection and expectations that we shared with you were still hold through. We gave some headwinds. We see that the tailwinds that, again, we shared are happening. We're happy with what we see. There is so much debate and literature exactly how many gigawatts have been deployed in North America and other parts of the world that I think it's better we reference to that as the market is still in a very dynamic situation right now. \nC. Stephen Tusa: Okay. And then just on orders, I would assume from this level that backlog will absolutely continue to grow every quarter. I mean you talked about the book-to-bill of 1.5x not being sustainable, but that's kind of a wide range. Should we assume that it should remain above 1x every quarter? And then just I know you're not going to particular here. But is the price at this stage now decelerating, stable or accelerating relative to what you guys have talked about in the fourth quarter as far as the orders are concerned? \nGiordano Albertazzi: So second and third question. So on the orders and backlog, I go back, if I'm not so surprised, Steve. So second and third question, backlog we believe for the remainder of the year, we'll be on or above 1x when it comes to book-to-bill. Whether that happens every quarter, it's a little bit premature to say. There are a lot of dynamics at play.\n Price, I go back to the comments we made in February. What I said, okay, we're not disclosing price. We're talking about price/cost. We're satisfied with the price/cost that we see and certainly is consistent, on the one hand, with the guidance we are giving you now obviously, but also is consistent with, let's say, the direction of travel and the vision that we shared with you at Investor Day. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. \nScott Davis: So I know this is a little bit of a obvious question perhaps, but a little color would be helpful. And as it relates to your book-to-bill, is the percentage of cooling as a percent of your backlog increasing proportionally with these new chips like the B200, the GB200, these NVIDIA chips that I don't know much about, but I read about them. It seems that they require a s*** ton of cooling, as you said in your Investor Day, but are you seeing that exact dynamic in your book-to-bill? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Yes, without going too much into the details and the direction in industry is going certainly not defined by a single quarter worth of orders mix. We are happy with our -- with the trajectory of liquid cooling. But when -- and when we look in general to -- we look in general at the mix of our bookings, we see it balanced across our portfolio. The cooling, the power, the modular, the service. So a pretty balanced picture.\n Think back to what we were saying is that there is an element of TAM expansion on the thermal side, the cooling side, as we said when we were talking about moving between $2.5 million, $3 million per megawatt to $3 million, $3.5 million. So that is probably also something that one may assume underlying. But again, it's early in, let's say, just look at 1 quarter. But we are happy about the trajectory of our liquid cooling orders. \nScott Davis: Okay. That's interesting. And Gio, as a follow-up in your liquid cooling capacity, is there anything particularly complicated about the production processes, the manufacturing? Is this kind of in your wheelhouse? Or is it a little bit of a different animal raising the risk profile of adding capacity? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We've been manufacturing, engineering, designing thermal management products across the board, whether it's liquid, whether it's refrigerant, whether it's a small or ginormous chillers or whatnot. So certainly, it takes our know-how, but we see a know-how that is consistent with our experience and certainly also benefiting from the experience of the team we onboarded recently. But all in all, we feel confident in the consistency of this technology with what we have learned over the decades. \nScott Davis: Okay. That's helpful. Best of luck, guys, and congrats on a good start. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Thank you. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: Gio, can you talk about what's going on by region? You mentioned some encouraging low single-digit growth in China. So has it turned the corner there? And then is India becoming big enough now that it matters for your Asia Pac growth moving forward? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, in general, we clearly closed 2023 with about 55% of revenue in the Americas. So the Americas is and continues to be the biggest region. And if you think about AI accelerated predominantly in the Americas, North America, Americas will continue to be very, very, very strong.\n We like what we see in Asia. David was explaining the situation in China. So some encouraging early signs, but early to say. Again, EMEA, it's -- I want to talk in terms of what the AI impact is. We start to see some movements in Asia. India is an important location for us. It's an important location also in terms of manufacturing capabilities and capacity. So we are pretty optimistic that AI will eventually roll over and activate them and also in Asia. EMEA may be a little bit behind in AI, but that's something that I already commented upon something like a 9- to 12-month lag. And again, we -- 2 months later, that's what we see in full. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: And Gio, just a quick follow-up. I think we know what hyperscalers are doing. In November, you mentioned the split in revenue, I think, was 50-50 with enterprise. Is that now toping more to hyperscalers given their growth? What are the enterprise customers doing? \nGiordano Albertazzi: So we -- just to caveat that question. When we talk about hyperscalers, we typically combine hyperscalers and colocation. So we do not give separate numbers. So it's -- that's kind of the big players. A lot of acceleration, as I said last time, is happening in that part of the business. So we -- also, in November, when we gave our projection of -- or our projection of the market dynamics, we saw that part of the market to accelerate the most. And that's still what we see. And so very happy with what we indicated back then. Eventually, I'm convinced the AI acceleration and impact will benefit the enterprise part of the market. But when that is happening, it's still a bit premature to say. And for the time being, we go back to the range that we gave back then, enterprise and distributed IT around 3% to 5% growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. \nMark Delaney: I think incremental margins are now tracking to be in the high 30% range for 2024 based on the new annual guidance compared to the mid-30% range that had been assumed previously. Is that type of leverage in the high 30% range something that might be sustained beyond 2024, especially with Vertiv's bookings and backlog coverage giving it more visibility and likely putting it in a better position to execute on price/costs? \nDavid Fallon: Yes. So this is David. For the full year, our incremental is estimated to be right around 40%. It was 62% in the first quarter. We guided 38% in the second quarter. And that does ramp down as you go through the year primarily driven by some more challenging comparables from a contribution margin year-over-year in the second half. But we're certainly pleased with those incrementals that we're guiding to.\n And consistent with what we said in the November Investor Day, our long-term target is to get to 20%-plus AOP, and that's in the time frame of '26 to '28. If we get there earlier in that period, in '26, we estimated mid-30% incrementals, maybe a little bit south of that, if it's '27 or '28. But of course, those incrementals become a little bit more challenging every year that we do increase that contribution margin. But we're still very optimistic that we'll be able to hit that long-term range in that time frame. \nMark Delaney: That's helpful context. My other question was thinking about the addressable market opportunity. You talked about the full powertrain on Slide 5 of your deck and showed various -- a variety of opportunities to address. Maybe you can help us understand how much of that addressable market Vertiv can serve today. And are there areas you can augment with either R&D or perhaps tuck-in M&A to improve the same you're addressing? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Two aspects. We've been vocal about what we think the TAM per megawatt is probably the easiest thing to say. We believe it will be available for us. I want to remind everyone, we believe we have the most complete portfolio of digital critical infrastructure. But again, a TAM that is on the traditional, let's say, data center design at $2.5 million to $3 million per megawatt going up $0.5 million with AI and high density. That's what we see.\n And of course, as you know and as we said several times, we are continuing to invest in engineering and R&D, a CAGR of approximately 13%. And clearly, acquisitions -- and acquisitions, certainly, as we have demonstrated with CoolTera, that enabled us to add technologies to our portfolio is something that is a part of our capital allocation strategy. But again, it's never binary. It's like technologies that we work on organically, and sometimes that organic then matches very well and inorganic opportunity. And again, instead of speculating about the future, I would refer back to what we did with CoolTera and liquid cooling by which we had both in indirect -- sorry in inorganic and organic, let's say, orchestrated that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. \nAndrew Obin: You guys put out a press release on the NVIDIA relationship. Can you comment what's exactly the nature of the relationship? Are you being standardized from that product? And also, how are you guys getting ready for the Blackwell product? Do you need to do anything technologically to be ready for higher-power conduction there? \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, it's a multifaceted relationship. And in a nutshell I would say that's certainly been part of the network -- partner network of NVIDIA, which is certainly essential from a commercial and go-to-market standpoint. There is an element of certification of our liquid cooling, but very, very importantly is the relationship that we have working together at engineering level. So still very, very important.\n When it comes to the future technologies and specifically Blackwell technology, it's clear. That's a technology that requires liquid cooling. So that's also the fact that we have now in the market a clear leader with something that is vocally liquid cooled as a chip. That will drive liquid cooling into band. And if you want to draw -- connect the dots with what I said about the liquid cooling that, that is legitimate.\n Now in terms of our portfolio, our portfolio is the right portfolio for the next generation. And next generation today -- there will be more generations, and we talked in several occasions about certain level going to 2-phase instead of just single-phase liquid cooling. And again, as we been vocally and publicly explaining, we are on that part of the technology, though. \nAndrew Obin: Got you. And as we think about the ramp of this new technology, right? Because I think as of last year, it was a fairly small percentage of your portfolio. And I completely understand how you are very well positioned to continue to have very strong position there from a technology standpoint. But is this ramp in technology? Do you need to invest? And the question we get from investors basically, given that it's brand-new technology, should we expect it to be margin-dilutive, at least in the first stage as you ramp up to full production? \nGiordano Albertazzi: So the fact it was small in the past in general for the industry is that the current generations can very well be air cooled. So the majority of deployments of GPU were air-cooled using the infrastructure. And that's true across the industry. I'm not talking about Vertiv here. When it comes to the investment in CDU capacity, and I refer back to our February earnings call, well, that is pretty well explained, and we are progressing in that capacity growth. When it comes to margins, it's a new technology. What we indicated already back then is the margin profile, I would say, is consistent with our thermal business, certainly consistent with the long-term trajectory to 20-plus percent that we shared with you as our long-term goal. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: So there's a lot of -- quite a few investor questions out there on the backlog aging. How much of the backlog is set for 2025 and beyond? So maybe some color on that would be helpful. My question was really more about maybe some color on the on-prem. Gio, you mentioned, obviously, a lot of the focus right now is on the AI GPUs and the hyperscales. But what we've seen on the on-prem side? And then finally, the other thing that caught my attention was the capacity increase on switchgear. So I'm just wondering what that doubling in capacity sort of underwrites in terms of your outlook for E&I over the next couple of years. \nGiordano Albertazzi: 3-in-1. Thank you, Nigel. So when it comes to the backlog agent, we will not go too much in the details about -- the indication we have is we have an element of a strategy a little bit of -- on the requested delivery dates and lead times that makes our coverage longer. On-prem versus hyperscale, certainly, we see, at this stage, the acceleration and dominantly in hyperscale and colo type of cloud for high density and AI. But I mentioned Data Center World, that's predominantly and mainly an enterprise type of show. It was a very, very, very crowded. So I leave it to that. When it comes to switchgear and busways/busbars, we're very happy. And again, that is a testament to the importance of the acquisition to make sure that we really have the entire portfolio and the entire powertrain from medium-voltage switchgear, all the way to distribution and inside-track PDUs. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: I guess maybe just when you guys have -- based on what you've received from an order perspective related to AI so far, has that been mostly focused on upgrades of existing data centers? Or would you say it's kind of a balance between that and actual new AI data center construction? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We feel a bit of 2, but it's still predominantly new data center for the time being. \nNicole DeBlase: Okay. Got it. That's clear. And then I guess with respect to the outlook for order growth, I know you guys said in the slide that you're expecting like sequentially down Q-on-Q, makes sense. I guess, what gives you conviction that there was a pull-forward? Like I mean, obviously, like every time we look at data center CapEx, it continues to rise higher. Why do you think it was a pull-forward into 2Q? Is that a direct customer comment? And any other color on like quantifying the level of order growth you guys are expecting in 2Q? I know I'm trying to pin you down, but there's obviously a lot of investor sensitivity to like expectations into the next quarter. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Absolutely. I mean the commercial side of that is not an exact science. Let's put it this way. We try to make the science statistically relevant using pipelines and stacks on the pipeline. So we call an order that lands in Q2 probably very granted, but there are things that are not necessarily in our control or Q2 or any other moment of time. So what we do is be very diligent in the way we manage pipeline and very diligent in the way we analyze pipeline statistically. This is something that characterized pipeline last quarter in Q4, and I was vocal about that was an acceleration. So the time it takes to -- in order to -- opportunities, sorry, to become an order. And we see statistically the same is true here.\n Now we are happy about our pipeline size. But from there to make an exact state of what future will look like is difficult. But our comments about pull-ins, if you will, are statistically based on things happening more rapidly than historically they've had, if it makes sense. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer. \nNoah Kaye: I would like to just maybe revisit Mark's question around the relationship between the longer lead time on the orders and margins. The company has done so much work over the last year-plus to improve management processes around pricing and sourcing. So as we see this backlog continuing to grow, how are you protecting margins in backlog? Do we indeed have higher visibility to the margin profile? \nGiordano Albertazzi: We multiple times have indicated and been vocal about our strengthened and continuously strengthening pricing muscle. And that also includes being factoring in dynamics on the material cost side of the equation and factoring in our targets of price/cost positivity, if you will, but also in terms of better contractual terms that allow us to react to something that is unforecasted. Well, that's also -- it's a commercial relationship. But we are in a much stronger place than we were, and we are happy with the trajectory in which we are and the actions and the mechanisms that we have implemented in the way we price and approve price. \nNoah Kaye: Okay. And a related housekeeping item. The guide last quarter was for $60 million positive price/cost for the year. Is it fair to say that it's still the assumption? Any changes to that? Is it also possible to say what it was for 1Q? \nDavid Fallon: The -- our expectation for full year has not changed significantly from what we shared in the first quarter, if anything, trending a little bit more favorable, but not significantly different. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Giordano Albertazzi for any closing remarks. \nGiordano Albertazzi: Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions -- multiple questions. But first and foremost, I'd like to thank the Vertiv team around the world. The focus on innovation, the customer service and execution is certainly something that is very palpable and strong. So thank you for the progress. Thanks for joining us today. And we really appreciate everybody's support, and have a very good day. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Gio. Turning to Page 6. This slide summarizes our first quarter financial results, strong performance to start the year. Organic net sales increased 8% with all 3 regions growing relatively consistently in the high single digits. Sales were above the high end of guidance with EMEA, the primary driver of that overperformance.\n Adjusted operating profit of $249 million was $73 million higher than last year's first quarter mainly due to favorable price/cost and higher volume. We exceeded the high end of guidance driven by the sales beat and higher productivity than expected in our model. Our adjusted operating margin increased 370 basis points to 15.2%, further demonstrating our continued focus on operational excellence, and that is certainly driving results. But as we have mentioned, still plenty of opportunity and much to do.\n Moving to the right. Our first quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.43, $0.19 higher than last year, primarily driven by the higher adjusted operating profit and also a small tailwind from income taxes. On the far right, adjusted free cash flow was $101 million for the quarter, which was 4x higher than last year's first quarter with the higher profitability flowing through to free cash flow. As Gio mentioned, net leverage was 2.2x at the end of the quarter. And despite the $600 million share repurchase, net leverage is only slightly higher than the 1.9x at year-end as we continue to expand EBITDA while generating cash. And based on forward expectations, we anticipate net leverage to decline to 2x or lower in the third quarter, if not sooner.\n As mentioned, the $600 million, 9.1 million share repurchase in the quarter included $525 million and approximately 8 million shares from Platinum as they exited their position. All in, we repurchased shares at an average price of $66, which looks pretty good at this point.\n Turning to Page 7. This slide summarizes our first quarter segment results. We had relatively balanced growth across the regions. Americas grew 7% driven by hyperscale and colocation. And this growth was on top of an extremely challenging comparison to first quarter 2023, where Americas grew over 60% from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin in the Americas expanded 340 basis points from last year's first quarter to 20.3% with the increase primarily driven by favorable price/cost and also productivity.\n APAC sales increased 9% organically, a stronger number than we have seen in this region in quite a while with this growth driven by continued strong market demand in India and the rest of Asia with both those subregions growing low double digits. Although not as strong as the rest of the region, China sales grew low single digits in the quarter, encouraging. But as we see China stabilizing, albeit at low levels, and we expect China growth to remain stable but muted throughout 2024.\n APAC adjusted operating margin increased 380 points driven by fixed cost leverage and improved contribution margin in China as we continue to focus on costs given the market headwinds there. EMEA grew 10% organically, which was higher than anticipated, partially driven by strength with switchgear and busbar. EMEA adjusted operating margin expanded 510 basis points to 18.4% driven by fixed cost leverage and improved contribution margin both from price cost and productivity. Corporate costs of $40 million increased $7 million from last year's first quarter primarily driven by a onetime benefit last year. For the full year, we expect corporate costs to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million.\n Next, moving to Slide 8. This is a look at our second quarter guidance. We are expecting organic sales growth of approximately 12% with Americas up mid-teens, APAC high single digits and EMEA low double digits. We anticipate an $18 million year-over-year foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most foreign currencies over the last several months. We expect second quarter adjusted operating profit between $315 million and $335 million and adjusted operating margin of 16.9%, up 240 basis points at the midpoint with expected benefits from price/cost partially offset by continued growth investments.\n Next, turning to Slide 9, our full year '24 guidance. Based upon a favorable start to the year and visibility into a strong sales pipeline for the rest of the year, we are increasing estimates for organic sales growth from 10% at the midpoint to approximately 12% with higher expectations across all 3 regions. In addition, we are increasing the midpoint of adjusted operating profit guidance from $1.3 billion in our prior guidance to $1.35 billion primarily driven by contribution margin on incremental sales. And as a result, we are increasing midpoint guidance for adjusted operating margin to 17.7% with the primary driver there being fixed cost leverage.\n The 17.7% full year adjusted operating margin guidance demonstrates our continued relentless focus on operational improvement across the business and is a stepping stone on our path to 20%-plus. But as always, pleased but never satisfied. Our projected 2024 adjusted diluted EPS of $2.32 at the midpoint represents an over 30% increase compared to last year, and that's primarily driven by the higher adjusted operating profit.\n Now there is some noise in our adjusted EPS and effective tax rate calculations for the first quarter and also for full year, to a lesser extent. And those are primarily driven by accounting requirements around the $177 million first quarter charge from change in fair value of warrant liabilities. And instead of investing valuable time on this call, we provided additional information on Slides 21 and 22 in the appendix, and we'll be more than happy to answer questions and review this information with analysts and investors after this call.\n And finally, moving to the far right on this slide. We are holding the midpoint of our adjusted free cash flow guidance at $825 million, which is approximately 92% free cash flow conversion for the year as we expect higher adjusted operating profit to be offset by higher taxes, higher net cash interest as we use cash for first quarter share repurchases. And as Gio mentioned, we are increasing our full year estimate for CapEx to $200 million to further support capacity for future growth.\n And with that said, I turn it back over to Gio. Yes. So this is David. For the full year, our incremental is estimated to be right around 40%. It was 62% in the first quarter. We guided 38% in the second quarter. And that does ramp down as you go through the year primarily driven by some more challenging comparables from a contribution margin year-over-year in the second half. But we're certainly pleased with those incrementals that we're guiding to.\n And consistent with what we said in the November Investor Day, our long-term target is to get to 20%-plus AOP, and that's in the time frame of '26 to '28. If we get there earlier in that period, in '26, we estimated mid-30% incrementals, maybe a little bit south of that, if it's '27 or '28. But of course, those incrementals become a little bit more challenging every year that we do increase that contribution margin. But we're still very optimistic that we'll be able to hit that long-term range in that time frame. The -- our expectation for full year has not changed significantly from what we shared in the first quarter, if anything, trending a little bit more favorable, but not significantly different."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Giordano Albertazzi",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Dave, and good day, everyone. We go to Slide 3. And as Dave mentioned, we had a good start to 2024. Q1 sales were up 8%, and we saw high single-digit growth across the 3 regions. Our orders grew 60% year-on-year and 4% sequentially. More to come on Slide 4. This is an indicator of good market demand and of our very relevant market position.\n The strength in order drove a very strong Q1 book-to-bill at 1.5x. Important to note, most of the orders overage in Q1 is for deliveries beyond '24. Most of the acceleration comes from large orders, which typically have longer customer-requested lead times. Adjusted operating profit was $249 million, corresponding to an adjusted operating margin of 15.2%, a significant $73 million and 370 bps improvement year-on-year, which demonstrates we are progressing on our road map to operational excellence, as explained at our Investor Day. Our adjusted free cash flow was $101 million, an improvement of $76 million from Q1 last year.\n In Q1, we repurchased 9.1 million shares at an average weighted price of $66 a share. This included buying back approximately $8 million of the shares from Platinum Advisers as they exited their position in Vertiv. We deployed $600 million of cash to do those share repurchases. We believe it was a favorable time to do so. Our net leverage at the end of the first quarter ticked up slightly to 2.2x driven by the opportunistic share repurchase in Q1. Our '24 guidance suggests that we will return comfortably to our targeted 1x to 2x range as we make our way through the year.\n We again raised our full year guidance and expect full year '24 organic growth of 12% and adjusted operating margins to expand to 17.7%. Overall, good progress towards our long-term target of 20-plus percent. I am pleased with the start of the year, and I'm very encouraged by what we see in the data center market and now positioned within that.\n Let's go to Page -- Slide 4 now. As you may have noticed, we did not include the market environment slide this quarter. It becomes difficult to differentiate shades of color for market over very short periods of time, and our last call was just about 2 months ago. We will continue to provide a view on how we see the market in our future earnings releases material and in our accompanying remarks.\n Certainly, we have seen a very strong data center market environment, and we feel we have a unique vantage point: our profile of 75% data center exposure and our decades of experience serving the industry. It is an industry that has reliability at its core. And during times of technological transformation, as the one underway now with AI, our customers lean on the knowledge strength Vertiv can offer. Advanced technology, deep domain expertise, global scale, 24/7 local service globally, these are true differentiators we built over the decade serving the data center industry and understanding its truly unique requirements and not easy to replicate.\n So if we look at the left side of Slide 4, extremely strong order growth, as we said. Pipelines velocity clearly increased as evidenced by backlog being up $800 million in first quarter. This acceleration brought into Q1 some orders we expected for future periods. It is also clear that AI is starting to scale, and that's particularly true in the Americas. We already explained the accelerated dynamics of large projects. So no surprise that most of the impact is on future years. That gives us better visibility as we think about the years ahead. We anticipate orders will remain strong, but I want to caution 60% order growth is not the new expectation. We are -- there are reasons specific to Q1 that supported that very high level of order growth.\n For example, Q1 was our easiest comparison given that Q1 '23 orders were down 33% year-on-year. The comparison will get tougher as '24 progresses, and precise timing on orders can fluctuate. So while I don't want to suggest false precision, seeing orders down Q1 to Q2 sequentially would not be a surprise. It is expected and not particularly worsen given the very high absolute value of Q1 orders. We are anyway expecting good order growth year-on-year in Q2.\n Our book-to-bill of 1.5x is very strong. Also here, we're not anticipating that this is the new normal. We believe book-to-bill should remain above 1x throughout the year, which suggests the absolute dollar of orders we are anticipating remains at high levels given the sales guidance range we provided. How that looks quarter-to-quarter depends on multiple factors like pipeline velocity and now customers build schedules.\n On capacity. I'm comfortable with the investments we are making, and it will support our customers. As a reminder, we have 22 manufacturing plants globally. As explained in the past, we have stringently cadence spend rigorous process to manage further capacity expansion decisions. We previously provided a $75 million to $200 million range for CapEx this year. We expect to be at the high end of that range. So please assume $200 million CapEx in '24, still comfortably within the 2.5% to 3% range of sales we provided at our investor conference.\n The ramp-up of production of liquid cooling globally continues as planned, and I'm happy to report we have production underway already at 2 of the 3 plants we shared with you we were planning to activate in '24. We are on track with the capacity ramp-up as shared in February. We continue to see strong momentum with AI-related orders. While we are not disclosing specific detail on our liquid cooling orders, or more broadly AI-related orders, we did see the pipeline for AI projects more than double in the last 2 months.\n We are starting to see AI scaling in North America. This is consistent with the GPU road maps, whereby next-generation chips will require liquid cooling. The pipeline is reflecting that technology shift, not only in terms of liquid cooling but in terms of the whole powertrain and thermal chain. We are working closely with our customers to get their infrastructure ready for what is ahead.\n Now to the right side of Slide 4 still. Supply chains continue to operate as expected, not without an occasional bump, but that's where our constantly improving supply chain resilience comes into play. We continue to build out our supply chain to support deployment of liquid cooling technology with the same rigor and resilience we have built in our existing supply chain. The geopolitical environment is becoming increasingly complex. We are working to constantly increase the resilience of our business. Looking at material inflation, a mixed bag, but we know things can change quickly. We continue to believe we are in an inflationary world, and the price/cost plans we're executing reflect that yet.\n Let's now turn to Slide 5. There is an intense focus on thermal management lately and rightfully so. As the market leader in data center cooling, we are uniquely positioned for that opportunity. But power is also very central to the evolution of data center design and to enable AI deployment and to fuel the overall market acceleration.\n Vertiv has a complete power offering, the whole powertrain to serve the data center market. We are quite relevant in both the power distribution and power quality segments of the data center market. The acquisition of E&I expanded the Vertiv portfolio to include medium-voltage switchgear, low-voltage switchgear and busway offering.\n We often get asked about capacity. We talked about liquid cooling in February. We want to spend a minute on power now. We are expanding our operational capacity significantly across the powertrain to support customer demand. A good example are busbars and switchgears. We have already doubled our capacity since we acquired E&I at the end of '21, and we are on track to double it again by the end of '25 to support the growth we see ahead.\n You heard me talk about always maintaining a circa 25% capacity we have room to cover demand peaks. This on average continues to be the way we manage capacity. The ability to operate end-to-end across the powertrain similar to what we do with a thermal chain is testament to Vertiv having the most complete digital infrastructure solution. This is an important reason why we are a partner of choice for our customers and work with them on designing the infrastructure for the high-density future.\n And with that, David, over to you. Well, thank you, David. Let's go to Slide 10. I was at the Data Center World Conference last week. I would say the excitement was absolutely palpable. So very clear signals from the data center market when it comes to demand. Our thought leadership was on display in power, thermal and specifically liquid cooling as we shared insights and collaborated with some of the industry's technology leaders, collaborated to chart the road map for the future of digital infrastructure.\n We value -- the value of know-how strength in serving this market today is unprecedented in my long industry experience. We like that a lot as we become more central to the enablement of AI deployment. We are scaling our global capacity to match the ambitions of the industry. And you need broad shoulders to keep up with that pace. We are moving fast and mobilizing around the globe.\n Our ability to continue to execute well is grounded in the high-performance culture we are creating and in the Vertiv Operating System we are continuing to deploy. The intensity of what we do is rapidly increasing, and the organization, let's continue to do things right and fast. This is the expectation I am driving every single day with a relentless focus and holding the entire Vertiv team, and me in the first place, accountable to deliver results. So the winners will be determined by their portfolio and their strength of execution. I believe you may, we fully intend to keep winning.\n With that said, over to you, Jordan, for the Q&A. Jeff, thank you for the question. So as I said, we see an acceleration that is certainly quite convincing in the whole AI space. When I was referring to doubling pipeline side in the last 2 months, that in and of itself is a very strong signal. The type of demand that we see is certainly around liquid cooling. And when we think liquid cooling, we think something that is consistent with the capacity curve that we gave a couple of months back. \n But truly, the demand is across the board. It's across the board in terms of the entirety of the powertrain and thermal chain. So just like we were expecting, there are some technologies that are specific to high-density compute or anyway GPU-based compute, but there is a market demand expansion that is simply more megawatts being deployed that is impacting the entire range. Again, it's not just one piece of the portfolio. It's the entire range. It's still early in many respects for the industry, and the industry and the design of future -- exact structure is still unfolding, but we are pleased to be able to follow our customers and to support our customer across the entire spectrum of their decision structurally. Jeff, I'll be very brief considering the second question. The situation has not dramatically changed from what we were saying -- we were seeing last time. Again, the industry is growing. Could there be kind of a bigger growth in absolute terms? Yes, but let's not forget that this is about building data center. This is about getting permits and getting power. So there is a lot, of course, of public also debate about this. So I'll reference to that. We can hear you now. Well, good one. Amit, thank you for the question. Certainly, we're very happy about our order number. The majority of the order overage, let's say, as I was saying in -- when we were going through the slides is indeed and the majority of the acceleration is coming from large projects, indeed. And what we have seen in the large projects, that there has been some extension, if you will, of the requested lead time or delivery date.\n So in the past, I was more talking about a 9- to 18-month window in terms of the requested delivery. Now this -- what we are serving is a little bit longer. So think in terms of 12, 18 months or so. That has been a little bit of a window of coverage changing behind us. But it's good. I mean we have more visibility of what our customers do, and that gives us the possibility to execute even more orderly and punctually, if you will, on everything and align supply chain.\n What does that mean in terms of the future years? It's probably premature. But again, while we stick still to the conversation we had at Investor Day in terms of the general dynamics of the market, what we see today is on the -- is fairly on the upper end of the ranges that we shared with you. So positive in that respect. Well, look, going into this detail would be given an updated view of what we shared with you back in -- at the end of November. So I will go back to comments I made answering, Amit. So we see that the projection and expectations that we shared with you were still hold through. We gave some headwinds. We see that the tailwinds that, again, we shared are happening. We're happy with what we see. There is so much debate and literature exactly how many gigawatts have been deployed in North America and other parts of the world that I think it's better we reference to that as the market is still in a very dynamic situation right now. So second and third question. So on the orders and backlog, I go back, if I'm not so surprised, Steve. So second and third question, backlog we believe for the remainder of the year, we'll be on or above 1x when it comes to book-to-bill. Whether that happens every quarter, it's a little bit premature to say. There are a lot of dynamics at play.\n Price, I go back to the comments we made in February. What I said, okay, we're not disclosing price. We're talking about price/cost. We're satisfied with the price/cost that we see and certainly is consistent, on the one hand, with the guidance we are giving you now obviously, but also is consistent with, let's say, the direction of travel and the vision that we shared with you at Investor Day. Yes, without going too much into the details and the direction in industry is going certainly not defined by a single quarter worth of orders mix. We are happy with our -- with the trajectory of liquid cooling. But when -- and when we look in general to -- we look in general at the mix of our bookings, we see it balanced across our portfolio. The cooling, the power, the modular, the service. So a pretty balanced picture.\n Think back to what we were saying is that there is an element of TAM expansion on the thermal side, the cooling side, as we said when we were talking about moving between $2.5 million, $3 million per megawatt to $3 million, $3.5 million. So that is probably also something that one may assume underlying. But again, it's early in, let's say, just look at 1 quarter. But we are happy about the trajectory of our liquid cooling orders. We've been manufacturing, engineering, designing thermal management products across the board, whether it's liquid, whether it's refrigerant, whether it's a small or ginormous chillers or whatnot. So certainly, it takes our know-how, but we see a know-how that is consistent with our experience and certainly also benefiting from the experience of the team we onboarded recently. But all in all, we feel confident in the consistency of this technology with what we have learned over the decades. Thank you. Thank you. Well, in general, we clearly closed 2023 with about 55% of revenue in the Americas. So the Americas is and continues to be the biggest region. And if you think about AI accelerated predominantly in the Americas, North America, Americas will continue to be very, very, very strong.\n We like what we see in Asia. David was explaining the situation in China. So some encouraging early signs, but early to say. Again, EMEA, it's -- I want to talk in terms of what the AI impact is. We start to see some movements in Asia. India is an important location for us. It's an important location also in terms of manufacturing capabilities and capacity. So we are pretty optimistic that AI will eventually roll over and activate them and also in Asia. EMEA may be a little bit behind in AI, but that's something that I already commented upon something like a 9- to 12-month lag. And again, we -- 2 months later, that's what we see in full. So we -- just to caveat that question. When we talk about hyperscalers, we typically combine hyperscalers and colocation. So we do not give separate numbers. So it's -- that's kind of the big players. A lot of acceleration, as I said last time, is happening in that part of the business. So we -- also, in November, when we gave our projection of -- or our projection of the market dynamics, we saw that part of the market to accelerate the most. And that's still what we see. And so very happy with what we indicated back then. Eventually, I'm convinced the AI acceleration and impact will benefit the enterprise part of the market. But when that is happening, it's still a bit premature to say. And for the time being, we go back to the range that we gave back then, enterprise and distributed IT around 3% to 5% growth. Two aspects. We've been vocal about what we think the TAM per megawatt is probably the easiest thing to say. We believe it will be available for us. I want to remind everyone, we believe we have the most complete portfolio of digital critical infrastructure. But again, a TAM that is on the traditional, let's say, data center design at $2.5 million to $3 million per megawatt going up $0.5 million with AI and high density. That's what we see.\n And of course, as you know and as we said several times, we are continuing to invest in engineering and R&D, a CAGR of approximately 13%. And clearly, acquisitions -- and acquisitions, certainly, as we have demonstrated with CoolTera, that enabled us to add technologies to our portfolio is something that is a part of our capital allocation strategy. But again, it's never binary. It's like technologies that we work on organically, and sometimes that organic then matches very well and inorganic opportunity. And again, instead of speculating about the future, I would refer back to what we did with CoolTera and liquid cooling by which we had both in indirect -- sorry in inorganic and organic, let's say, orchestrated that. Well, it's a multifaceted relationship. And in a nutshell I would say that's certainly been part of the network -- partner network of NVIDIA, which is certainly essential from a commercial and go-to-market standpoint. There is an element of certification of our liquid cooling, but very, very importantly is the relationship that we have working together at engineering level. So still very, very important.\n When it comes to the future technologies and specifically Blackwell technology, it's clear. That's a technology that requires liquid cooling. So that's also the fact that we have now in the market a clear leader with something that is vocally liquid cooled as a chip. That will drive liquid cooling into band. And if you want to draw -- connect the dots with what I said about the liquid cooling that, that is legitimate.\n Now in terms of our portfolio, our portfolio is the right portfolio for the next generation. And next generation today -- there will be more generations, and we talked in several occasions about certain level going to 2-phase instead of just single-phase liquid cooling. And again, as we been vocally and publicly explaining, we are on that part of the technology, though. So the fact it was small in the past in general for the industry is that the current generations can very well be air cooled. So the majority of deployments of GPU were air-cooled using the infrastructure. And that's true across the industry. I'm not talking about Vertiv here. When it comes to the investment in CDU capacity, and I refer back to our February earnings call, well, that is pretty well explained, and we are progressing in that capacity growth. When it comes to margins, it's a new technology. What we indicated already back then is the margin profile, I would say, is consistent with our thermal business, certainly consistent with the long-term trajectory to 20-plus percent that we shared with you as our long-term goal. 3-in-1. Thank you, Nigel. So when it comes to the backlog agent, we will not go too much in the details about -- the indication we have is we have an element of a strategy a little bit of -- on the requested delivery dates and lead times that makes our coverage longer. On-prem versus hyperscale, certainly, we see, at this stage, the acceleration and dominantly in hyperscale and colo type of cloud for high density and AI. But I mentioned Data Center World, that's predominantly and mainly an enterprise type of show. It was a very, very, very crowded. So I leave it to that. When it comes to switchgear and busways/busbars, we're very happy. And again, that is a testament to the importance of the acquisition to make sure that we really have the entire portfolio and the entire powertrain from medium-voltage switchgear, all the way to distribution and inside-track PDUs. We feel a bit of 2, but it's still predominantly new data center for the time being. Absolutely. I mean the commercial side of that is not an exact science. Let's put it this way. We try to make the science statistically relevant using pipelines and stacks on the pipeline. So we call an order that lands in Q2 probably very granted, but there are things that are not necessarily in our control or Q2 or any other moment of time. So what we do is be very diligent in the way we manage pipeline and very diligent in the way we analyze pipeline statistically. This is something that characterized pipeline last quarter in Q4, and I was vocal about that was an acceleration. So the time it takes to -- in order to -- opportunities, sorry, to become an order. And we see statistically the same is true here.\n Now we are happy about our pipeline size. But from there to make an exact state of what future will look like is difficult. But our comments about pull-ins, if you will, are statistically based on things happening more rapidly than historically they've had, if it makes sense. We multiple times have indicated and been vocal about our strengthened and continuously strengthening pricing muscle. And that also includes being factoring in dynamics on the material cost side of the equation and factoring in our targets of price/cost positivity, if you will, but also in terms of better contractual terms that allow us to react to something that is unforecasted. Well, that's also -- it's a commercial relationship. But we are in a much stronger place than we were, and we are happy with the trajectory in which we are and the actions and the mechanisms that we have implemented in the way we price and approve price. Well, thank you, everyone, for your questions -- multiple questions. But first and foremost, I'd like to thank the Vertiv team around the world. The focus on innovation, the customer service and execution is certainly something that is very palpable and strong. So thank you for the progress. Thanks for joining us today. And we really appreciate everybody's support, and have a very good day."

Demand is clearly accelerating, and we're well positioned to capture the growth and to deliver great returns for our investors. We demonstrated the flexibility of our capital deployment strategy, initiating an opportunistic share repurchase in the first quarter, and our current cash flow generation profile provides wonderful opportunity.\n We've made great progress, but our focus is on how much further we still have to go. Gio and the team are working process improvement everywhere. Hard work doesn't pay off with our results, so you will see the results in the orders and sales growth, profitability and cash generation. We intend to build a track record of consistency over many years.\n We're well positioned to further differentiate and gain competitive advantage with the technology shifts underway in the data center industry. Our goal is not just to be better than we were last year or the year before but to be better than everyone at serving our customers and running our business at world-class levels. Essential to accomplishing that is creating a high-performance culture. We can't be great without it. That high-performance culture is starting to take hold, and we are still very early on this journey.\n I'm excited about the year ahead. It started off strong. And I'm more excited about 2025 and beyond and the opportunity we have to continue to create tremendous shareholder value. We ain't done yet. I'm also enjoying my discussions with Gio. He in each meeting is saying, for my next trick, and it's working, and I'm enjoying it.\n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Gio."
