With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryan Specialty Group, Pat Ryan.\nPatrick Ryan: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, I will provide a brief overview of the quarter and the full year, and our strategy moving forward; our President, Tim Turner, will then give an update on each of our 3 specialties and recent events; last, our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham will walk you through our financials; and then we\u2019ll open up for Q&A. Our fourth quarter performance capped-off an outstanding 2021 for Ryan Specialty. We continue to execute well across our business during the quarter, generating another strong quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. During the full year 2021 organic revenue growth of 22.4% and total revenue growth of 41%. We continue to demonstrate every single day, a clear and differentiated value with Ryan Specialty platform provides to its new and existing clients. Along with our extraordinary top-line growth, we\u2019re proud of our numerous additional accomplishments in 2021. We grew our adjusted EBITDAC by 57% from the prior year, driven by our strong organic growth, and inclusion of all risks for a full year. Just as importantly, the scalability of our platform was clearly validated in 2021. As we improve our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 330 basis points from 2020 and 710 basis points in 2019. As Jeremiah will discuss shortly, we have navigated the pandemic well and have taken the right steps to further build and scale our platform to be able to generate operating leverage over the long-term. All risks in Ryan Specialty are truly working as one company. The transitioned a cultural fit continue to exceed our expectations. We successfully completed our initial public offering in July. It\u2019s been wonderful to welcome those of you on the phone today to the Ryan Specialty story. Lastly, our team is stronger than ever, as we finished 2021, we maintained a 97% producer retention rate, which speaks to the winning culture we\u2019ve developed at Ryan Specialty. We have created a true destination of choice for the top talent in the industry and we\u2019re just getting started. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to complete 2 highly strategic acquisitions, Crouse and Associates, and Keystone Risk Partners. Combined these 2 acquisitions could generated approximately $34 million in additional revenue for the trailing 12 months prior to the acquisition. Crouse represents a leader in transportation and specialty wholesale brokerage,   located on the West Coast, the broker\u2019s license in all 50 states spans the breadth of our transportation offering, and enhances our ability to compete for the most complex accounts. The solutions ranging from traditional open market wholesale brokerage to niche binding authorities. Keystone represents our entrants into a natural adjacency covering the alternative risk base, which you\u2019ll hear Tim touch on in his remarks. He showed us an acquisition I\u2019m particularly excited about as he will expand our ability to serve brokers, agents and carriers by leading with innovation, and offering alternatives to more traditional insurance placements. Let\u2019s start 2021 on a high note, as we progress through 2022, here\u2019s what you should expect to see from Ryan Specialty. First, we expect to keep growing, the complexity of risks continues to increase. And as a result, the E&S market continues to expand faster than the admitted market, which we believe puts the opportunity to sustainably grow our business firmly within reach. In addition, pricing in the E&S market remains firm, but even with moderation on rates, our model is built to succeed in any pricing environment. Almost Ryan\u2019s  in 2022, we also expect to strengthen our business to position us to generate sustainable growth for years to come. And that means prudently investing more in each of our 3 specialties. In particular, that means both investing in our existing talent base, and constantly bringing in new talent. We expect to onboard our largest broker class ever in 2022, and currently see incredible opportunities in the marketplace, hire additional experienced talent, fortify our position as an industry leader. Further, this rapidly evolving capital landscape provides many unique opportunities for innovative platforms like Ryan Specialty. We enjoyed broad capital support, and robust distribution network, we plan to leverage one of our core strategies, de novo programs in MGAs, MGUs as we\u2019re well positioned to combined underwriting expertise and distribution capabilities with carry appetite for profitable growth, new lines of business, including the transition of admitted lines portfolios to the E&S market. Some of these opportunities are spurred by the dislocation of underwriting talent. We are in a unique position to capitalize on this dislocation, as we\u2019ve created a destination of choice for skilled underwriters and brokers. This core competency complements our M&A strategy and environments where available M&A targets don\u2019t meet our selective criteria of being both strategic and accretive. We believe we still have very exciting high growth opportunities to augment the organic growth of our existing business. As you know hard market leads to increase competition, particularly in managed underwriting. That competition comes from MGUs, as well as carriers looking to opportunistically enter or expand certain lines since we act as a delegate for insurers. Leading the de novo, which comprised nearly half of our MGU offerings, as well as adding experience talent remains integral to our success, especially now as new entrants and manage underwriting intensify the battle for specialty underwriters and market share. To that point, we are working on launching 3 de novo MGUs, supported by highly rated carriers, we are in the process of finalizing the definitive agreements necessary to start underwriting business. I hope to be able to share more detail with you on our next call. These investments are among the highest return on investments that we can make. Finally, our deep M&A expertise should enable us to act quickly and prudently, when we see an opportunity to add to our robust platform, which will help enhance our future organic growth capabilities. We\u2019re looking for A+ players, who can leverage our platform to enhance their own growth profile. We maintain active dialogue with a number of potential partners, including several proprietary conversations. As we mentioned before, we don\u2019t set dollar spent targets for M&A. We will continue to be as disciplined now, as a public company, as we were one private insurer  that each acquisition is both accretive to our strategy and to our shareholder returns. Equally important, we will never compromise on our culture. In Summary, 2021 was a banner year for Ryan Specialty, which is a testament to our business model, and the entire team rowing in the same direction, executing day in and day out for our clients and trading partners. We have a winning culture that empowers the best team in the specialty insurance industry and that is reflected in our performance for the year. We met excited for the future growth of our firm and our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our President, Tim Turner. Tim?\nTimothy Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. And as Pat highlighted, it was another excellent quarter and a fantastic year at Ryan Specialty. And we are hard at work on making 2022 another successful year. It\u2019s an incredibly challenging environment for many insurers and carriers. We believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned to help our clients navigate a very dynamic risk landscape. Our wholesale brokerage specialty continued to experience solid growth across all property casualty lines of business, especially in our professional liability lines, driven by our continued strong performance in this prolonged hard market and the increasing flow of business into the E&S channel. We are also excited about the addition of our new teammates from Crouse and Associates, who will integrate into our Transportation Practice Group and National Binding Authority Platform. Our transportation team had been working diligently to create new products for our trading partners. And the addition of Crouse team on the West Coast will be a significant complement to these efforts and further fill in our national transportation footprint. This allows us to be even more competitive to the largest national transportation accounts and to provide staying power for this critical line of business. At our Binding Authority Specialty, we continue to see strong growth within our small commercial lines of business. As Pat mentioned, we have a fantastic opportunity to participate in the consolidation of the highly fragmented delegated authority market. But we did with the Crouse acquisition on our path toward building the first truly 50-state Binding Authority operation. We believe we are attracting the best talent and positioning ourselves well, so that we\u2019re able to strike when the right opportunities arise. Meanwhile, our underwriting management specialty completed a solid quarter and an exceptional year growing total revenue of 46% from 2020. It\u2019s important to remember for this specialty that carriers and trust their underwriting authority to us, growth must be balanced with delivering underwriting profit back to our trading partners, and we are constantly reacting to market pricing and competitive dynamics. Underwriting performance and carrier relationships are measured in years, not in quarters. As Lloyds  has pulled back in the market, we\u2019ve had the good fortune of replacing it with large U.S., Bermuda and European insurers and reinsurers to fill the gap. We\u2019ve been expanding our capacity with even better financed individual carrier units, putting our platform in an even stronger position than prior years. Underwriting management has been proactively investing in specific initiatives to drive sustainable long-term growth, and arranging incremental underwriting capital to further strengthen our operations. In addition, onboarding experienced talent and market leaders is always critical to remaining an industry leader, and even more so when a prolonged hard market attracts new entrants. To that end, we have hired several industry leaders to launch in excess casualty MGU. And as Pat referenced, are in the final stages of securing capital, the rate environment remains full of opportunities within this product line. Finally, we\u2019re seeing solid progress with our UK based D&O specialist StartPoint, as they ramp up their U.S. branch. With recent key hires, the U.S. team is coming together well, and we are securing capacity for its entry into the U.S. distribution system. Along with the progress we\u2019re making at our 3 specialties, our M&A pipeline remains robust, including potential opportunities for our new employee benefits specialty. As we\u2019ve noted before today\u2019s acquisition is tomorrow\u2019s organic growth. And we look forward to partnering with successful specialty firms that are aligned with our goals, culture, values, and expectations for organic growth. A great example of this is our recent acquisition of Keystone, which allows us to facilitate access to alternative capital. This transaction is exciting for several reasons. It enhances our mission to provide innovative solutions for brokers, agents, and carriers. And it represents a significant growth opportunity, as alternative risk capital is a natural home for some of the E&S risks. Together with a talented team from Keystone, we will be able to develop entirely new insurance products, when and where we see a need in the market. I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019ve already created one such product with more in the pipeline. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do with our M&A strategy. Add talent and capabilities to our business that can use differentiated platform and trading partner relationships to immediately drive growth, while better serving our clients. We also continue to aggressively recruit new talent. As Pat mentioned, we are expecting our largest broker class ever in 2022. And in addition, we anticipate a record matriculation at Ryan Specialty University later this year as well. Because we have a university and formalized training program for new graduates, as well as a sizable internship program, we\u2019re able to recruit top level graduates from risk management programs from across the country. Our ability to continue to add the best specialized talent to our already world class producer team will enable us to keep growing our business well into the future. In terms of the E&A market, while we are seeing early signs of additional competition entering on the fringes as they become more comfortable with the environment and their balance sheets, flow remains steady thus far in 2022. As we\u2019ve noted, we expect that the increasing flow of business into the non-admitted market will continue to be one of the most significant drivers of Ryan Specialty\u2019s growth, coupling this market segment growth with our industry leading talent and culture position, Ryan Specialty is very well positioned for the coming year. We are excited for 2022 and we will continue to press our competitive advantages to grow our business. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of the fourth quarter.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. Let\u2019s get straight to the financial results. In Q4, we grew total revenue 16% period-over-period to $379 million. Our top-line increase was driven by continued strong organic revenue growth of 15.4% for the quarter attributable to a combination of new client when an expanding relationships with existing clients. We are very pleased to have performed so well in Q4 2021, especially considering we were comping  against 21.8% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. As we noted on our prior call, the Q4 2020 comp was challenging in part because of a large balance of pandemic deferred business like M&A and construction risks, which wasn\u2019t expected to repeat in q4 of 2021. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $323 million, a 16% increase year-over-year. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $30 million or $0.09 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO related and other unusual expenses increased 24% period-over-period to $77 million. Adjusted EBITDAC for the fourth quarter grew 18% period-over-period to $120 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin raised 70 basis points to 31.8% for the quarter. Primary drivers of these increases were our revenue growth leading to scale in adjusted comp and benefits, as well as the continued realization of cost savings from our restructuring plan, which we initiated in 2020. This is partially offset by the realization of public company costs incurred in Q4, which will also generate a drag to adjusted EBITDAC margin when comparing quarterly margins year-over-year in Q1 and Q2 of 2022, as we did not yet have these costs included in the comparable periods in 2021. As we think about adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year of 2022 with Omicron receding, we welcome a return to a more normalized pre-pandemic level of G&A expense, as we experienced a broader return to in-person meetings and events. We will also have a full year of public company costs in 2022. And most importantly, we will continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business. In particular, the current environment offers us a unique and very exciting opportunity to hire A+ level underwriters and brokers, as Pat ad Tim have both highlighted. And we expect to capitalize on this opportunity to pursue an onboard top talent to our platform. With that said, I do want to highlight a crucial takeaway and provide some important context for 2022 in terms of adjusted EBITDAC margin. In 2019, which was the last full year prior to the pandemic, we generated adjusted EBITDAC margin of 25.0% as a private company. Now, in 2020 and 2021, we certainly benefited from reduced levels of T&E spend. But even as that normalizes in 2022, and we record a full year of public company costs, we still expect to generate adjusted EBITDAC margins well above what we recorded in 2019. This is a clear testament to the scalability of the platform that we\u2019ve built here at Ryan Specialty, and we are very proud of everything we\u2019ve accomplished over the last several years. And as I\u2019ve noted over the long term, we expect that our growth will yield additional and sustainable operating leverage in the form of adjusted EBITDAC margin. Finally, we reported adjusted diluted EPS of $0.29 for the quarter and believe that adjusted diluted EPS provides a more comparable period-over-period measure of our operating performance. Please refer to the earnings release and 10-K for further discussion of the components of adjusted diluted EPS. Also, we are initiating our full 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows. We are guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2022 to be between 13% and 15%. As a reminder with our exceptional growth in 2021, and now that all risks is part of the full year organic growth rate calculation, our organic growth comps are more challenging giving the significantly higher revenue base. Further, we are in the prolonged stages of a very hard market and increased flow into the E&S market. And as such, we want to be prudent with our outlook given what Tim noted earlier regarding the additional competitors beginning to enter the market. Thus, our forecast assumes that current conditions which Tim and Pat have both noted are still very conducive to grow at this moment, do gradually soften and decelerate somewhat during 2022. Adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year, we are guiding to be between 28.0% and 30.0%. We are investing heavily in talent and growth in 2022 to best serve our clients over the long-term, which could impact margins in the near term. That said if you compare this range to our 2021 results on a like for like basis, in terms of T&E spend and public company costs. Our forecast actually represents a healthy amount of operating leverage, especially when you consider the current human capital environment and the large potential long-term investment opportunities that we have in front of us. As a reminder as well, Q1 and Q3 are our lightest quarters from an adjusted EBITDAC margin perspective and typically fall below our margin for the full year. Q2 and q4 are typically our highest adjusted EBITDAC margin quarters, and Q1 tends to generally be our lowest margin quarter overall. As an example, in 2020, we printed 22.1% in Q1 and 28.8% for the full year. As Pat noted, it was a truly banner year for Ryan Specialty and we are very excited about another year of exceptional growth ahead of us. With that, we thank you for your time and would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question is on the organic revenue outlook. So as we think about the 13% to 15% for this coming year. Can you help us think about the seasonality there just given the Q2 and the Q3 of 2021 are your strongest quarters? Should we think about the Q1 and Q4 benefiting from easier comps? So just can you help us think about how you expect the organic to progress as we move through the year?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yeah, Elyse, so we will stop sort of giving actual guidance revenue guidance for on a quarterly basis. But you are correct, Q2 and Q4 are typically the largest quarters from a seasonality perspective, Q1 and Q3 are typically the lightest, and remember that margin typically follows those trends as well.\nElyse Greenspan: And then are you \u2013 can you let us \u2013 can you disclose how all risk performed from an organic perspective in the fourth quarter of 2021?\nJeremiah Bickham: That would be below the level of materiality that we disclose. But we can say \u2013 as we said on our Q3 call, we\u2019re really excited about the integration progress about how our key and the former all risk folks are working really as one company, and we\u2019re really excited about having them in the organic revenue calculation, because they are contributing mightily.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then one last one on the M&A side, you guys seem pretty bullish describing the pipeline is robust. Any color you can give us on the size of deals in the pipeline, as you think out over 2022 and even beyond?\nPatrick Ryan: Yes, the size varies, obviously. There are some moderate size, a few smaller, but very strategic, at the moment we\u2019re not really in discussions, and don\u2019t expect to be with mega deals like all risks. But we\u2019re staying pretty much within the average of the past without all risks. And I think that will continue.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Can you discuss your $400 million debt raise in January; I realize the use of proceeds is for general corporate purposes. But would it be fair to assume a good portion of those use of proceeds can be used for M&A?\nJeremiah Bickham: Tracy, that\u2019s a correct assumption. I mean, as you have probably seen from looking at the earnings release, we have ample liquidity. And we actually didn\u2019t specifically need the cash from the bond raise in January, but we saw an opportunity and we were proactive. And we\u2019re really glad that we were proactive given where the market is now. The plan is still for excess capital to be deployed to fund internal growth, but mostly M&A. And we are still planning to generally operate in the 3 to 4 times net leverage category.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay, great. You provide some really good color regarding your EBITDAC margin guide. I\u2019m just wondering, you also discuss your larger broker class of 2022 also trying to think about your latest acquisitions. So to what extent do you think the comp structure may be playing into your EBITDAC margin guide?\nJeremiah Bickham: The comp structure of \u2013 the legacy business of acquisitions? Or of the new hires?\nTracy Benguigui: Everything. If any color you could provide, how it should all come together?\nJeremiah Bickham: Well, so that\u2019s an important, I mean, let\u2019s just talk about the labor market and wage inflation, because I think that\u2019s part of your question. So our margin range does contemplate the current labor market. But keep in mind, Tracy, most of our comp is related to producers who are actually paid a commission, which is based on a percentage of revenue that they generate. So wage inflation doesn\u2019t really affect them the same way, but it does salaried employees. And unfortunately, even in this environment, we offer not just competitive pay, but also a unique culture and unique long-term professional development opportunity. So we feel really good about our ability to remain a destination of choice in this environment.\nPatrick Ryan: You asked about all of the above. And I\u2019d like to add to Jeremiah\u2019s very appropriate comments. We mentioned that we are looking for A+ players as underwriters and as brokers, A+ players as underwriters and brokers can make a lot of money, but business follows them quickly. And we built our business on attracting and developing A+ players, and there\u2019s a unique period of time right now that we feel that is very opportune time to be looking for that kind of talent, and we are doing that. Thank you.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Zaremski, please proceed with your question.\nMichael Zaremski: Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks. So maybe first question, in the prepared remarks and in the guide, you mentioned a moderation rates, which I think there\u2019s different camps of thought on the right outlook some kind of feel like their stability, some feels like there could be an uplift due to the current macro backdrop in some field like there\u2019s likely deceleration clearly sounds like you\u2019re in the deceleration camp. But maybe any color on what you\u2019re seeing so far year-to-date, or just kind of what\u2019s driving that outlook?\nTimothy Turner: Well, we certainly see some modest rate deceleration and in certain product lines, and some real early signs and stages of standard markets, writing some high excess layers of D&O and access casualty, placements, taking them back. But we continue to operate in a very hard market state. The conditions in the market firm, almost every month, we just received January surplus lines, stamping results from WSIA, and that flow is up over 20% once again. So the flow into the channel is a better gauge for us in terms of the market share in the commercial P&C market that\u2019s available to us. And again, that continues to grow, we continue to capture more of it. And there\u2019s no sign of the hard market letting up.\nJeremiah Bickham: So Mike, it\u2019s a consistent theme for us. We like to forecast prudently. And we\u2019re trying to draw on the 5 cycles that Pat has lived through, the 3 or 3 plus that Tim has lived through. And it\u2019s subtle, but I tried to touch on it my prepared remarks, we are seeing the very early signs, they\u2019re really not detectable in the numbers right now. And we\u2019re not saying we know how far or how fast they will progress. But those very early signs just reinforce our view that it\u2019s prudent to predict moderation during the year.\nPatrick Ryan: There\u2019s another factor that needs to be considered, and that\u2019s the war. And we bring into that broader discussion a little bit later if you\u2019d like, but with the war \u2013 pardon me, that introduced a lot more risk into the world. And you\u2019ve watched what\u2019s going on in Russia with nationalization, and so on. So all kinds of new risks coming in, that insurance industry has to cope with.\nMichael Zaremski: That\u2019s it. Maybe we can dig into that unpack that this unfortunate situation. I mean, are there cycles, we can look at where we can say, this is the impact the insurance cycle or demand posts previous alter wars or is there any color how you guys are thinking about how this could change the marketplace?\nPatrick Ryan: Well, I was talking with a friend of mine, the CEO of insurance carrier has been in his position 3 plus years. And he said I think I\u2019m a jinx, climate started hit really hard 3 plus years ago, social inflation hit, now we got a pandemic, now we got a war. There\u2019s no history. There\u2019s no precedent on that. It\u2019s never accrued in the history of this country in terms of insurance coverages.\nTimothy Turner: Correct. And, Mike, just to be clear, too, we\u2019re not saying we have, we actually have no direct revenue exposure to Russia or Ukraine. It\u2019s more of a statement that we live in a global economy, and the whole world is impacted by geopolitical events like this.\nMichael Zaremski: Understood. Maybe one follow-up separately. So just on the leverage levels, we can see where your pro forma leverage level is now, we know roughly what the cash generation of the company is should we be thinking that you\u2019ll have runway to deploy the debt raise plus free cash flow kind of over the next year or so? And also just as there, when we think about the acquisitions, you\u2019re making is there? Should we be thinking they\u2019re usually kind of margin neutral? There\u2019s no just way to think about that as their goal is going to be different.\nTimothy Turner: They are all going to be different. But I would say that for modeling purposes, Mike, just assume margin neutral. As we start to actually close on benefits businesses, wholesale benefits businesses at some point, those can \u2013 those often do have a little bit of a different margin profile to our legacy wholesale businesses. And we can give more color on that as time progresses. But the answer to the first part of your question is, yes, we think that given the robust market and our robust pipeline. We \u2013 that\u2019s why I said earlier that the excess liquidity we have on our balance sheet is earmarked for M&A. I don\u2019t want to put a timetable on that, because I think that creates the wrong incentives. But we are hopeful that there are ample opportunities out there that meet our highly selective criteria of being strategic and accretive that and we\u2019re hoping we can talk to you about those very soon.\nMichael Zaremski: Thank you very much for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Scott: Good afternoon. First one I have for you is just on the growth outlook for 2022. I was wondering if you could maybe even just qualitatively discuss sort of how wholesale brokerage binding authority and underwriting management play into the growth outlook do you provided.\nJeremiah Bickham: So we won\u2019t give \u2013 we give guidance at the segment level, we\u2019re one segment so consolidated. You may have noticed in some of Pat\u2019s prepared remarks, the current environment is favorable overall for E&S specialist like us. But the competitive dynamics are a little bit different. For example, for a wholesale broker like our key versus an underwriting manager, there\u2019s also differences that I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of in terms of, you know, a delegated authority, underwriter has to be mindful of the capital providers\u2019 balance sheet. So growth has to be balanced with an underwriting profit. And so that does have an impact on the growth prospects. But we\u2019ve said before, that all 3 specialties are robust contributors to the aggregate organic growth percentage, and they\u2019re all currently in some way or another benefiting from the favorable market conditions that Tim said at this moment are still alive and well.\nPatrick Ryan: As you know in the wholesale distribution market, there are far fewer competitors than there is in the underwriting business. Most of these lines have 20, 30, 40 sometimes less sometimes 10 markets that are anxious to write the business. We\u2019re a microcosm of that, and then we represent those carriers. So if we\u2019re representing a carrier, as an MGU, we\u2019re going up against other carriers who are dealing without an MGU, and some carriers are dealing with an MGU. So there\u2019s just I know, you know, this may be appreciated the choir, but it\u2019s important to understand that that\u2019s the competitive profile of the different of the delegated authority against the wholesale program and the end the different responsibilities, the dual responsibility of care to capital provider, and client being retail broker. The wholesale broker has a duty of care to the retail broker.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Very helpful. Follow-up question sort of separate is just following up on the comments about the environment and just disruption from the conflict going on in Ukraine and Russia? Are you starting to see that actually in pricing and specific lines? I mean, is it more isolated to maybe cyber policies or anywhere else you\u2019re seeing that start to actually make its way in a tangible way to pricing?\nPatrick Ryan: Well, that\u2019s really a good question. And the answer is, there\u2019s all kinds of factors that are driving prices up in cyber, and probably all the global issues on hacking. And the accusations that go back and forth has been affecting cyber, so there\u2019s probably some cyber influence already from the geopolitical issues. Nationalization of airplane leashes, that\u2019s not one that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the marketplace at all. But we\u2019ll be quickly the inflation that is becoming more and more apparent, and in more people\u2019s minds, being driven by the war, with supply chain issues and lots of other disruptions, I think those are just beginning to come into the market. So I think that the war, only being a few weeks old is obviously in front of mind to everybody, and then trying to sort out what it means. So I don\u2019t think you see much of it maybe the cyber product, as you pointed out, probably nothing but you\u2019re going to look at political risk and like a trade credit. You\u2019re going to look at D&O, because corporations will get blamed, corporate leaders will get blamed for problems that come up. And so, ocean Marina cargo, but we don\u2019t have any managing underwriting business, very modest  tremendous piece. Now, in terms of wholesale brokerage, yes, we have that, but that\u2019s not the same kind of risk when we\u2019re representing the carrier, we have to make sure that their appetite stays satisfied and gratified that we\u2019ve given the profitable business.\nAlex Scott: Thanks for the responses.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nWeston Bloomer: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And my first one is on the de novo formations that you talked about in the prepared remarks. You\u2019re not going to get any specifics on how material the impact may be. But is there any way you could quantify the typical \u2013 how that typically trends in a typical year or in 2021, or any additional color on the rationale in 2020 versus prior years?\nJeremiah Bickham: So just to make \u2013 I\u2019m going to repeat the question, just to make sure I understand it, you\u2019re looking for any sort of color we can provide on like maybe the ramp up to scale, or to even just revenue for these some of these de novo MGUs?\nWeston Bloomer: Exactly, yes. And maybe what impact was there in 2021 or prior years from other like de novo formation? How should we think about that in a typical year?\nPatrick Ryan: Well, the ramp up is unpredictable, because we\u2019re assembling the capital. In some cases, we\u2019ve hired the talent. In all cases, each of the cases we have \u2013 pardon me, talent is about to be hired. So that\u2019s a timing issue. But then as the assembly of the capital you need the front or the primary carrier, and then you need quota share participants on a on a subscription basis, or quota share reinsurance. We\u2019re very experienced and professionally strong in supplying all of that. But it\u2019s a process and it\u2019s not instantaneous by any means. And so we just can\u2019t forecast what the near term ramp up right it is. But I would say this, there in lines of business that the market needs, or we wouldn\u2019t be doing it. And we\u2019re attracting talent that will be differentiating on behalf of the market. So we\u2019re optimistic about both the results and near term, slowly for the first few months, and then accelerating \u2013 we can\u2019t forecast the acceleration. But in the past, is past being prologue. We\u2019ve had excellent returns on our de novo. And we build some very sizeable businesses and de novo with getting the right talent, and then getting the right amount of capital support. The good news now is that we have all of what it takes to set up a de novo MGU. In that we have access to the primary paper or the fronting paper, we have access to support of reinsurance and our subscription support very strong carrier, we have good infrastructure support, we have access to the retail brokers, and we just have to get the right talent. And we\u2019re pretty good at that.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. Thank you. And then on free cash flow, is there any way you could provide additional color on how we should think about free cash flow conversion in 2022, either as a percentage of revenue or earnings? Or can you talk to what initiatives that you\u2019re taking to improve your free cash flow overall?\nJeremiah Bickham: So I just want to remind you of the way that we think is most instructive to calculate that. And the formula is starting with adjusted EBITDAC then taking out interest expense, takeout adjusted income tax expense, and then CapEx. Under that formulation, if you track 2019, 2021 trending in the right direction. We expect 2022 to be a continuation of that trend as well.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks very much. Both Pat \u2013 and I want to say, Tim mentioned that this is a very good opportunity for recruiting somebody who could dig into that a little bit. And the reason I\u2019m asking is because we haven\u2019t seen to the best of my knowledge, these really disruptive potential acquisitions that I thought would have been a great source of recruitment opportunity?\nTimothy Turner: So Meyer, you\u2019re looking for color from us on sort of maybe some of the underlying factors or conditions that lead to this opportunity for all these new hires we\u2019re talking about?\nMeyer Shields: Exactly.\nPatrick Ryan: Sure. I\u2019ll start it and Tim could pick up. With all the disruption in the marketplace with \u2013 both, of the disruption. There\u2019s been an entrepreneurial spirit sort of stimulated and underwriters. And brokers want to be a part of an organization that has a platform for broad growth opportunities. That\u2019s where our independence has been very important to us. And so we have that they\u2019re also looking for a culture where they can have freedom of real bureaucratic nature and that they see that with us. And frankly, they\u2019re looking for reward for performance. These people are all paid on a performance even the underwriters are paid on performance just based on the growth of the business and the profitability for the underwriters. So they\u2019re performance driven, they\u2019re high achievers. And then lastly, many of them are in companies where they don\u2019t have equity available. And you\u2019ve seen the phenomenon of roll ups with PEs at stimulated people to think, well, maybe it\u2019s time for me to get some equity. So our going public, frankly, has helped attract people to our story that they read about us now much more than they did when we were private. So they know a lot more about us. And they\u2019ve seen that we performed well, so that our stock has reflected that. And so I think this is greater interest in exploring things with us.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, thank you. That was very helpful. And if I can follow-up with a quick question, not with regard to guidance, but when we talk about the initial signs of increasing competition, is there one of the specialties in other words wholesale versus binding authority or underwriting management where that should manifest itself sooner?\nJeremiah Bickham: Meyer, are you trying to figure out in terms of related to the prepared remarks, where we were most \u2013where the competition comments are most relevant among the 3 specialties to wholesale binding versus underwriting managers?\nMeyer Shields: Yeah, that\u2019s right.\nPatrick Ryan: Okay, well, it\u2019s definitely on the managing underwriting, because of the abundance of carriers, Meyer. As I know, many of these lines of 20 to 30 to 40 carriers, when you\u2019re a wholesale broker, you either get the order or you don\u2019t. And we get the order, a great deal of the time managing underwriting retail broker or wholesale broker might will be getting 3, 4, 5 quotes, and so there\u2019s much more competition out there for that business. And then, you\u2019ve seen this Meyer that with rates escalating in certain lines, and in terms of tightening that\u2019s attracting more aggressive pursuit by carriers. But we\u2019re just a mirror image of what happens with the carrier, because we represent these carriers. The good news is that we\u2019re very discreet specialties, and our differentiated talent has allowed us to be quite successful, but it\u2019s competitive. So competition demands that you keep hiring higher quality and more quantity, because the volume is so high, you have to have large teams, underwriting teams to handle this. But you have to have the really expert underwriters. And that was the process I described in the earlier question.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, excellent. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nPatrick Ryan: Okay. Well, thank you, operator; and thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for your continued interest and support of Ryan Specialty. We value that very highly. We look forward to speaking with you again, when we discuss our first quarter of 2022 results. Thank you and have a good evening.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Jeremiah Bickham",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. Let's get straight to the financial results. In Q4, we grew total revenue 16% period-over-period to $379 million. Our top-line increase was driven by continued strong organic revenue growth of 15.4% for the quarter attributable to a combination of new client when an expanding relationships with existing clients. We are very pleased to have performed so well in Q4 2021, especially considering we were comping  against 21.8% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. As we noted on our prior call, the Q4 2020 comp was challenging in part because of a large balance of pandemic deferred business like M&A and construction risks, which wasn't expected to repeat in q4 of 2021. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $323 million, a 16% increase year-over-year. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $30 million or $0.09 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO related and other unusual expenses increased 24% period-over-period to $77 million. Adjusted EBITDAC for the fourth quarter grew 18% period-over-period to $120 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin raised 70 basis points to 31.8% for the quarter. Primary drivers of these increases were our revenue growth leading to scale in adjusted comp and benefits, as well as the continued realization of cost savings from our restructuring plan, which we initiated in 2020. This is partially offset by the realization of public company costs incurred in Q4, which will also generate a drag to adjusted EBITDAC margin when comparing quarterly margins year-over-year in Q1 and Q2 of 2022, as we did not yet have these costs included in the comparable periods in 2021. As we think about adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year of 2022 with Omicron receding, we welcome a return to a more normalized pre-pandemic level of G&A expense, as we experienced a broader return to in-person meetings and events. We will also have a full year of public company costs in 2022. And most importantly, we will continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business. In particular, the current environment offers us a unique and very exciting opportunity to hire A+ level underwriters and brokers, as Pat ad Tim have both highlighted. And we expect to capitalize on this opportunity to pursue an onboard top talent to our platform. With that said, I do want to highlight a crucial takeaway and provide some important context for 2022 in terms of adjusted EBITDAC margin. In 2019, which was the last full year prior to the pandemic, we generated adjusted EBITDAC margin of 25.0% as a private company. Now, in 2020 and 2021, we certainly benefited from reduced levels of T&E spend. But even as that normalizes in 2022, and we record a full year of public company costs, we still expect to generate adjusted EBITDAC margins well above what we recorded in 2019. This is a clear testament to the scalability of the platform that we've built here at Ryan Specialty, and we are very proud of everything we've accomplished over the last several years. And as I've noted over the long term, we expect that our growth will yield additional and sustainable operating leverage in the form of adjusted EBITDAC margin. Finally, we reported adjusted diluted EPS of $0.29 for the quarter and believe that adjusted diluted EPS provides a more comparable period-over-period measure of our operating performance. Please refer to the earnings release and 10-K for further discussion of the components of adjusted diluted EPS. Also, we are initiating our full 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows. We are guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2022 to be between 13% and 15%. As a reminder with our exceptional growth in 2021, and now that all risks is part of the full year organic growth rate calculation, our organic growth comps are more challenging giving the significantly higher revenue base. Further, we are in the prolonged stages of a very hard market and increased flow into the E&S market. And as such, we want to be prudent with our outlook given what Tim noted earlier regarding the additional competitors beginning to enter the market. Thus, our forecast assumes that current conditions which Tim and Pat have both noted are still very conducive to grow at this moment, do gradually soften and decelerate somewhat during 2022. Adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year, we are guiding to be between 28.0% and 30.0%. We are investing heavily in talent and growth in 2022 to best serve our clients over the long-term, which could impact margins in the near term. That said if you compare this range to our 2021 results on a like for like basis, in terms of T&E spend and public company costs. Our forecast actually represents a healthy amount of operating leverage, especially when you consider the current human capital environment and the large potential long-term investment opportunities that we have in front of us. As a reminder as well, Q1 and Q3 are our lightest quarters from an adjusted EBITDAC margin perspective and typically fall below our margin for the full year. Q2 and q4 are typically our highest adjusted EBITDAC margin quarters, and Q1 tends to generally be our lowest margin quarter overall. As an example, in 2020, we printed 22.1% in Q1 and 28.8% for the full year. As Pat noted, it was a truly banner year for Ryan Specialty and we are very excited about another year of exceptional growth ahead of us. With that, we thank you for your time and would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Yeah, Elyse, so we will stop sort of giving actual guidance revenue guidance for on a quarterly basis. But you are correct, Q2 and Q4 are typically the largest quarters from a seasonality perspective, Q1 and Q3 are typically the lightest, and remember that margin typically follows those trends as well. That would be below the level of materiality that we disclose. But we can say \u2013 as we said on our Q3 call, we're really excited about the integration progress about how our key and the former all risk folks are working really as one company, and we're really excited about having them in the organic revenue calculation, because they are contributing mightily. Tracy, that's a correct assumption. I mean, as you have probably seen from looking at the earnings release, we have ample liquidity. And we actually didn't specifically need the cash from the bond raise in January, but we saw an opportunity and we were proactive. And we're really glad that we were proactive given where the market is now. The plan is still for excess capital to be deployed to fund internal growth, but mostly M&A. And we are still planning to generally operate in the 3 to 4 times net leverage category. The comp structure of \u2013 the legacy business of acquisitions? Or of the new hires? Well, so that's an important, I mean, let's just talk about the labor market and wage inflation, because I think that's part of your question. So our margin range does contemplate the current labor market. But keep in mind, Tracy, most of our comp is related to producers who are actually paid a commission, which is based on a percentage of revenue that they generate. So wage inflation doesn't really affect them the same way, but it does salaried employees. And unfortunately, even in this environment, we offer not just competitive pay, but also a unique culture and unique long-term professional development opportunity. So we feel really good about our ability to remain a destination of choice in this environment. So Mike, it's a consistent theme for us. We like to forecast prudently. And we're trying to draw on the 5 cycles that Pat has lived through, the 3 or 3 plus that Tim has lived through. And it's subtle, but I tried to touch on it my prepared remarks, we are seeing the very early signs, they're really not detectable in the numbers right now. And we're not saying we know how far or how fast they will progress. But those very early signs just reinforce our view that it's prudent to predict moderation during the year. So we won't give \u2013 we give guidance at the segment level, we're one segment so consolidated. You may have noticed in some of Pat's prepared remarks, the current environment is favorable overall for E&S specialist like us. But the competitive dynamics are a little bit different. For example, for a wholesale broker like our key versus an underwriting manager, there's also differences that I'm sure you're aware of in terms of, you know, a delegated authority, underwriter has to be mindful of the capital providers' balance sheet. So growth has to be balanced with an underwriting profit. And so that does have an impact on the growth prospects. But we've said before, that all 3 specialties are robust contributors to the aggregate organic growth percentage, and they're all currently in some way or another benefiting from the favorable market conditions that Tim said at this moment are still alive and well. So just to make \u2013 I'm going to repeat the question, just to make sure I understand it, you're looking for any sort of color we can provide on like maybe the ramp up to scale, or to even just revenue for these some of these de novo MGUs? So I just want to remind you of the way that we think is most instructive to calculate that. And the formula is starting with adjusted EBITDAC then taking out interest expense, takeout adjusted income tax expense, and then CapEx. Under that formulation, if you track 2019, 2021 trending in the right direction. We expect 2022 to be a continuation of that trend as well. Meyer, are you trying to figure out in terms of related to the prepared remarks, where we were most \u2013where the competition comments are most relevant among the 3 specialties to wholesale binding versus underwriting managers?"

            "name": "Patrick Ryan",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today's call, I will provide a brief overview of the quarter and the full year, and our strategy moving forward; our President, Tim Turner, will then give an update on each of our 3 specialties and recent events; last, our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham will walk you through our financials; and then we'll open up for Q&A. Our fourth quarter performance capped-off an outstanding 2021 for Ryan Specialty. We continue to execute well across our business during the quarter, generating another strong quarter of double-digit organic revenue growth. During the full year 2021 organic revenue growth of 22.4% and total revenue growth of 41%. We continue to demonstrate every single day, a clear and differentiated value with Ryan Specialty platform provides to its new and existing clients. Along with our extraordinary top-line growth, we're proud of our numerous additional accomplishments in 2021. We grew our adjusted EBITDAC by 57% from the prior year, driven by our strong organic growth, and inclusion of all risks for a full year. Just as importantly, the scalability of our platform was clearly validated in 2021. As we improve our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 330 basis points from 2020 and 710 basis points in 2019. As Jeremiah will discuss shortly, we have navigated the pandemic well and have taken the right steps to further build and scale our platform to be able to generate operating leverage over the long-term. All risks in Ryan Specialty are truly working as one company. The transitioned a cultural fit continue to exceed our expectations. We successfully completed our initial public offering in July. It's been wonderful to welcome those of you on the phone today to the Ryan Specialty story. Lastly, our team is stronger than ever, as we finished 2021, we maintained a 97% producer retention rate, which speaks to the winning culture we've developed at Ryan Specialty. We have created a true destination of choice for the top talent in the industry and we're just getting started. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to complete 2 highly strategic acquisitions, Crouse and Associates, and Keystone Risk Partners. Combined these 2 acquisitions could generated approximately $34 million in additional revenue for the trailing 12 months prior to the acquisition. Crouse represents a leader in transportation and specialty wholesale brokerage,   located on the West Coast, the broker's license in all 50 states spans the breadth of our transportation offering, and enhances our ability to compete for the most complex accounts. The solutions ranging from traditional open market wholesale brokerage to niche binding authorities. Keystone represents our entrants into a natural adjacency covering the alternative risk base, which you'll hear Tim touch on in his remarks. He showed us an acquisition I'm particularly excited about as he will expand our ability to serve brokers, agents and carriers by leading with innovation, and offering alternatives to more traditional insurance placements. Let's start 2021 on a high note, as we progress through 2022, here's what you should expect to see from Ryan Specialty. First, we expect to keep growing, the complexity of risks continues to increase. And as a result, the E&S market continues to expand faster than the admitted market, which we believe puts the opportunity to sustainably grow our business firmly within reach. In addition, pricing in the E&S market remains firm, but even with moderation on rates, our model is built to succeed in any pricing environment. Almost Ryan's  in 2022, we also expect to strengthen our business to position us to generate sustainable growth for years to come. And that means prudently investing more in each of our 3 specialties. In particular, that means both investing in our existing talent base, and constantly bringing in new talent. We expect to onboard our largest broker class ever in 2022, and currently see incredible opportunities in the marketplace, hire additional experienced talent, fortify our position as an industry leader. Further, this rapidly evolving capital landscape provides many unique opportunities for innovative platforms like Ryan Specialty. We enjoyed broad capital support, and robust distribution network, we plan to leverage one of our core strategies, de novo programs in MGAs, MGUs as we're well positioned to combined underwriting expertise and distribution capabilities with carry appetite for profitable growth, new lines of business, including the transition of admitted lines portfolios to the E&S market. Some of these opportunities are spurred by the dislocation of underwriting talent. We are in a unique position to capitalize on this dislocation, as we've created a destination of choice for skilled underwriters and brokers. This core competency complements our M&A strategy and environments where available M&A targets don't meet our selective criteria of being both strategic and accretive. We believe we still have very exciting high growth opportunities to augment the organic growth of our existing business. As you know hard market leads to increase competition, particularly in managed underwriting. That competition comes from MGUs, as well as carriers looking to opportunistically enter or expand certain lines since we act as a delegate for insurers. Leading the de novo, which comprised nearly half of our MGU offerings, as well as adding experience talent remains integral to our success, especially now as new entrants and manage underwriting intensify the battle for specialty underwriters and market share. To that point, we are working on launching 3 de novo MGUs, supported by highly rated carriers, we are in the process of finalizing the definitive agreements necessary to start underwriting business. I hope to be able to share more detail with you on our next call. These investments are among the highest return on investments that we can make. Finally, our deep M&A expertise should enable us to act quickly and prudently, when we see an opportunity to add to our robust platform, which will help enhance our future organic growth capabilities. We're looking for A+ players, who can leverage our platform to enhance their own growth profile. We maintain active dialogue with a number of potential partners, including several proprietary conversations. As we mentioned before, we don't set dollar spent targets for M&A. We will continue to be as disciplined now, as a public company, as we were one private insurer  that each acquisition is both accretive to our strategy and to our shareholder returns. Equally important, we will never compromise on our culture. In Summary, 2021 was a banner year for Ryan Specialty, which is a testament to our business model, and the entire team rowing in the same direction, executing day in and day out for our clients and trading partners. We have a winning culture that empowers the best team in the specialty insurance industry and that is reflected in our performance for the year. We met excited for the future growth of our firm and our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our President, Tim Turner. Tim? Yes, the size varies, obviously. There are some moderate size, a few smaller, but very strategic, at the moment we're not really in discussions, and don't expect to be with mega deals like all risks. But we're staying pretty much within the average of the past without all risks. And I think that will continue. You asked about all of the above. And I'd like to add to Jeremiah's very appropriate comments. We mentioned that we are looking for A+ players as underwriters and as brokers, A+ players as underwriters and brokers can make a lot of money, but business follows them quickly. And we built our business on attracting and developing A+ players, and there's a unique period of time right now that we feel that is very opportune time to be looking for that kind of talent, and we are doing that. Thank you. There's another factor that needs to be considered, and that's the war. And we bring into that broader discussion a little bit later if you'd like, but with the war \u2013 pardon me, that introduced a lot more risk into the world. And you've watched what's going on in Russia with nationalization, and so on. So all kinds of new risks coming in, that insurance industry has to cope with. Well, I was talking with a friend of mine, the CEO of insurance carrier has been in his position 3 plus years. And he said I think I'm a jinx, climate started hit really hard 3 plus years ago, social inflation hit, now we got a pandemic, now we got a war. There's no history. There's no precedent on that. It's never accrued in the history of this country in terms of insurance coverages. As you know in the wholesale distribution market, there are far fewer competitors than there is in the underwriting business. Most of these lines have 20, 30, 40 sometimes less sometimes 10 markets that are anxious to write the business. We're a microcosm of that, and then we represent those carriers. So if we're representing a carrier, as an MGU, we're going up against other carriers who are dealing without an MGU, and some carriers are dealing with an MGU. So there's just I know, you know, this may be appreciated the choir, but it's important to understand that that's the competitive profile of the different of the delegated authority against the wholesale program and the end the different responsibilities, the dual responsibility of care to capital provider, and client being retail broker. The wholesale broker has a duty of care to the retail broker. Well, that's really a good question. And the answer is, there's all kinds of factors that are driving prices up in cyber, and probably all the global issues on hacking. And the accusations that go back and forth has been affecting cyber, so there's probably some cyber influence already from the geopolitical issues. Nationalization of airplane leashes, that's not one that I don't think it's in the marketplace at all. But we'll be quickly the inflation that is becoming more and more apparent, and in more people's minds, being driven by the war, with supply chain issues and lots of other disruptions, I think those are just beginning to come into the market. So I think that the war, only being a few weeks old is obviously in front of mind to everybody, and then trying to sort out what it means. So I don't think you see much of it maybe the cyber product, as you pointed out, probably nothing but you're going to look at political risk and like a trade credit. You're going to look at D&O, because corporations will get blamed, corporate leaders will get blamed for problems that come up. And so, ocean Marina cargo, but we don't have any managing underwriting business, very modest  tremendous piece. Now, in terms of wholesale brokerage, yes, we have that, but that's not the same kind of risk when we're representing the carrier, we have to make sure that their appetite stays satisfied and gratified that we've given the profitable business. Well, the ramp up is unpredictable, because we're assembling the capital. In some cases, we've hired the talent. In all cases, each of the cases we have \u2013 pardon me, talent is about to be hired. So that's a timing issue. But then as the assembly of the capital you need the front or the primary carrier, and then you need quota share participants on a on a subscription basis, or quota share reinsurance. We're very experienced and professionally strong in supplying all of that. But it's a process and it's not instantaneous by any means. And so we just can't forecast what the near term ramp up right it is. But I would say this, there in lines of business that the market needs, or we wouldn't be doing it. And we're attracting talent that will be differentiating on behalf of the market. So we're optimistic about both the results and near term, slowly for the first few months, and then accelerating \u2013 we can't forecast the acceleration. But in the past, is past being prologue. We've had excellent returns on our de novo. And we build some very sizeable businesses and de novo with getting the right talent, and then getting the right amount of capital support. The good news now is that we have all of what it takes to set up a de novo MGU. In that we have access to the primary paper or the fronting paper, we have access to support of reinsurance and our subscription support very strong carrier, we have good infrastructure support, we have access to the retail brokers, and we just have to get the right talent. And we're pretty good at that. Sure. I'll start it and Tim could pick up. With all the disruption in the marketplace with \u2013 both, of the disruption. There's been an entrepreneurial spirit sort of stimulated and underwriters. And brokers want to be a part of an organization that has a platform for broad growth opportunities. That's where our independence has been very important to us. And so we have that they're also looking for a culture where they can have freedom of real bureaucratic nature and that they see that with us. And frankly, they're looking for reward for performance. These people are all paid on a performance even the underwriters are paid on performance just based on the growth of the business and the profitability for the underwriters. So they're performance driven, they're high achievers. And then lastly, many of them are in companies where they don't have equity available. And you've seen the phenomenon of roll ups with PEs at stimulated people to think, well, maybe it's time for me to get some equity. So our going public, frankly, has helped attract people to our story that they read about us now much more than they did when we were private. So they know a lot more about us. And they've seen that we performed well, so that our stock has reflected that. And so I think this is greater interest in exploring things with us. Okay, well, it's definitely on the managing underwriting, because of the abundance of carriers, Meyer. As I know, many of these lines of 20 to 30 to 40 carriers, when you're a wholesale broker, you either get the order or you don't. And we get the order, a great deal of the time managing underwriting retail broker or wholesale broker might will be getting 3, 4, 5 quotes, and so there's much more competition out there for that business. And then, you've seen this Meyer that with rates escalating in certain lines, and in terms of tightening that's attracting more aggressive pursuit by carriers. But we're just a mirror image of what happens with the carrier, because we represent these carriers. The good news is that we're very discreet specialties, and our differentiated talent has allowed us to be quite successful, but it's competitive. So competition demands that you keep hiring higher quality and more quantity, because the volume is so high, you have to have large teams, underwriting teams to handle this. But you have to have the really expert underwriters. And that was the process I described in the earlier question. Okay. Well, thank you, operator; and thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for your continued interest and support of Ryan Specialty. We value that very highly. We look forward to speaking with you again, when we discuss our first quarter of 2022 results. Thank you and have a good evening."

            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. And as Pat highlighted, it was another excellent quarter and a fantastic year at Ryan Specialty. And we are hard at work on making 2022 another successful year. It's an incredibly challenging environment for many insurers and carriers. We believe we're uniquely positioned to help our clients navigate a very dynamic risk landscape. Our wholesale brokerage specialty continued to experience solid growth across all property casualty lines of business, especially in our professional liability lines, driven by our continued strong performance in this prolonged hard market and the increasing flow of business into the E&S channel. We are also excited about the addition of our new teammates from Crouse and Associates, who will integrate into our Transportation Practice Group and National Binding Authority Platform. Our transportation team had been working diligently to create new products for our trading partners. And the addition of Crouse team on the West Coast will be a significant complement to these efforts and further fill in our national transportation footprint. This allows us to be even more competitive to the largest national transportation accounts and to provide staying power for this critical line of business. At our Binding Authority Specialty, we continue to see strong growth within our small commercial lines of business. As Pat mentioned, we have a fantastic opportunity to participate in the consolidation of the highly fragmented delegated authority market. But we did with the Crouse acquisition on our path toward building the first truly 50-state Binding Authority operation. We believe we are attracting the best talent and positioning ourselves well, so that we're able to strike when the right opportunities arise. Meanwhile, our underwriting management specialty completed a solid quarter and an exceptional year growing total revenue of 46% from 2020. It's important to remember for this specialty that carriers and trust their underwriting authority to us, growth must be balanced with delivering underwriting profit back to our trading partners, and we are constantly reacting to market pricing and competitive dynamics. Underwriting performance and carrier relationships are measured in years, not in quarters. As Lloyds  has pulled back in the market, we've had the good fortune of replacing it with large U.S., Bermuda and European insurers and reinsurers to fill the gap. We've been expanding our capacity with even better financed individual carrier units, putting our platform in an even stronger position than prior years. Underwriting management has been proactively investing in specific initiatives to drive sustainable long-term growth, and arranging incremental underwriting capital to further strengthen our operations. In addition, onboarding experienced talent and market leaders is always critical to remaining an industry leader, and even more so when a prolonged hard market attracts new entrants. To that end, we have hired several industry leaders to launch in excess casualty MGU. And as Pat referenced, are in the final stages of securing capital, the rate environment remains full of opportunities within this product line. Finally, we're seeing solid progress with our UK based D&O specialist StartPoint, as they ramp up their U.S. branch. With recent key hires, the U.S. team is coming together well, and we are securing capacity for its entry into the U.S. distribution system. Along with the progress we're making at our 3 specialties, our M&A pipeline remains robust, including potential opportunities for our new employee benefits specialty. As we've noted before today's acquisition is tomorrow's organic growth. And we look forward to partnering with successful specialty firms that are aligned with our goals, culture, values, and expectations for organic growth. A great example of this is our recent acquisition of Keystone, which allows us to facilitate access to alternative capital. This transaction is exciting for several reasons. It enhances our mission to provide innovative solutions for brokers, agents, and carriers. And it represents a significant growth opportunity, as alternative risk capital is a natural home for some of the E&S risks. Together with a talented team from Keystone, we will be able to develop entirely new insurance products, when and where we see a need in the market. I'm pleased to report that we've already created one such product with more in the pipeline. That's exactly what we're trying to do with our M&A strategy. Add talent and capabilities to our business that can use differentiated platform and trading partner relationships to immediately drive growth, while better serving our clients. We also continue to aggressively recruit new talent. As Pat mentioned, we are expecting our largest broker class ever in 2022. And in addition, we anticipate a record matriculation at Ryan Specialty University later this year as well. Because we have a university and formalized training program for new graduates, as well as a sizable internship program, we're able to recruit top level graduates from risk management programs from across the country. Our ability to continue to add the best specialized talent to our already world class producer team will enable us to keep growing our business well into the future. In terms of the E&A market, while we are seeing early signs of additional competition entering on the fringes as they become more comfortable with the environment and their balance sheets, flow remains steady thus far in 2022. As we've noted, we expect that the increasing flow of business into the non-admitted market will continue to be one of the most significant drivers of Ryan Specialty's growth, coupling this market segment growth with our industry leading talent and culture position, Ryan Specialty is very well positioned for the coming year. We are excited for 2022 and we will continue to press our competitive advantages to grow our business. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of the fourth quarter. Well, we certainly see some modest rate deceleration and in certain product lines, and some real early signs and stages of standard markets, writing some high excess layers of D&O and access casualty, placements, taking them back. But we continue to operate in a very hard market state. The conditions in the market firm, almost every month, we just received January surplus lines, stamping results from WSIA, and that flow is up over 20% once again. So the flow into the channel is a better gauge for us in terms of the market share in the commercial P&C market that's available to us. And again, that continues to grow, we continue to capture more of it. And there's no sign of the hard market letting up. Correct. And, Mike, just to be clear, too, we're not saying we have, we actually have no direct revenue exposure to Russia or Ukraine. It's more of a statement that we live in a global economy, and the whole world is impacted by geopolitical events like this. They are all going to be different. But I would say that for modeling purposes, Mike, just assume margin neutral. As we start to actually close on benefits businesses, wholesale benefits businesses at some point, those can \u2013 those often do have a little bit of a different margin profile to our legacy wholesale businesses. And we can give more color on that as time progresses. But the answer to the first part of your question is, yes, we think that given the robust market and our robust pipeline. We \u2013 that's why I said earlier that the excess liquidity we have on our balance sheet is earmarked for M&A. I don't want to put a timetable on that, because I think that creates the wrong incentives. But we are hopeful that there are ample opportunities out there that meet our highly selective criteria of being strategic and accretive that and we're hoping we can talk to you about those very soon. So Meyer, you're looking for color from us on sort of maybe some of the underlying factors or conditions that lead to this opportunity for all these new hires we're talking about?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.\n I will now turn the call over to your host, Noah Angeletti. \nNoah Angeletti: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Ryan Specialty Group Holdings Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This afternoon, the company released its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. The earnings release is available on the Investors section of the company's website at ryansg.com.\n I would like to remind everyone that certain statements made during this call are not based on historical information and may constitute forward-looking statements.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP are included in our earnings release, which is available on the Investors section of the company's website at ryansg.com.\n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryan Specialty Group, Pat Ryan. \nPatrick Ryan: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today's call, I will provide a brief overview of the quarter and our differentiated business model. Our President, Tim Turner, will then give an update on each of our 3 specialties. And finally, our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham, will walk you through the details of the quarter, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.\n We had an excellent quarter, which was our first quarter as a public company and a testament to our great team. We executed well on all facets of our business and grew our top line by nearly 50%. The majority of that growth was accomplished organically. This type of organic growth rate is seldom seen in the industry and is clear evidence of the differentiated value that the Ryan Specialty platform provides to its new and existing clients.\n Our team continues to demonstrate its talent and expertise to deliver critical solutions to our trading partners in placing these complex risks. It's vital to be a subject matter expert and to specialize in the product, the industry or both. And for us, that expertise is evident in our wholesale and our delegated underwriting authority specialties.\n We also continue to grow our bottom line, leading to another quarter of strong adjusted EBITDAC and expanding margins compared to the prior year period. We have a firm handle on our business. We continue to be the destination of choice with the best talent in our industry. And we are in a prime position to sustainably grow Ryan Specialty at an impressive pace for years to come.\n As we near the end of 2021, we continue to see strong trends in our industry. The $65-plus billion E&S market continues to expand faster than the admitted market as the complexity of risks continues to grow. This requires experience and knowledgeable producers and underwriters to guide clients with innovative and customized solutions. That's our power rally. Innovation is in our DNA. It provides us with a long-term opportunity to grow both sustainably and profitably.\n Pricing in the E&S market remains firm and resilient. And as a reminder, our model is built to outperform in any pricing environment. Retail broker panels and delegated underwriting authority remain fragmented to a very large extent, and a significant amount of consolidation has yet to occur. This will lead to a continued movement by retailers towards a singular solution for the E&S needs, which we are well positioned to serve. And our pipeline for M&A remains robust, and we continue to have productive conversations with potential targets to add to our platform. We will remain very active but disciplined with respect to M&A, and we'll execute only when the opportunity is right.\n Our independent, full-service model, scaled distribution platform and deep bench of experts gives us a clear advantage compared to our competition. We believe we have the most comprehensive product access, underwriting knowledge and extensive distribution network for both retail insurance brokers and carriers. This has enabled us to become a preferred and trusted partner. We're 97th of the top 100 retail insurance brokers in the country.\n Notably, we continue to prioritize our recruitment, development and retention of the top talent in the industry. We constantly recruit the most talented individuals to join Ryan Specialty, empower them to contribute diverse perspectives and thought leadership and enable them to become an integral part of our winning culture. As a result, they have incredible opportunities to succeed and are very well rewarded for their contributions.\n Looking ahead, our growth plans remain firmly intact, and we are well positioned to execute on them. As I noted on our prior call, we will continue to methodically invest in our growth and ensure Ryan Specialty remains a destination of choice for the industry's top-tier talent.\n We will continue to lead with innovation to meet the ever-changing needs of the market. We will continue to expand and deepen our relationships with our current clients as well as continue to win new clients. We will further enhance our future organic growth capabilities by executing strategically and prudently on M&A.\n In summary, I'm very proud of our team's tremendous efforts in the third quarter. Our dedication, empowered by our winning culture, has clearly contributed to our positive performance results. They continue to validate our business model and our value proposition to our trading partners. I remain very excited for the future growth of our company and our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\n With that now, I'm very pleased to turn the call over to our President, Tim Turner. Tim? \nTimothy Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. As Pat highlighted, we had an outstanding quarter, and our success was broad-based across our 3 specialties. \n Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty is where we distribute a wide range and diversified mix of specialty insurance products and solutions from insurance carriers to retail brokerage firms. We experienced solid growth across property and casualty lines and especially in professional liability lines of business. This growth was driven by our continued strong performance in this prolonged hard market, combined with an increasing flow of business into the E&S channel.\n At our Binding Authority specialty, we continue to see strong growth within our small commercial lines of business. In addition, on our prior call, we noted the tremendous opportunity to address the highly fragmented delegated authority market where both M&A and panel consolidation are in their very early stages. For decades, companies that delegated binding authority did so on a state-by-state or geographical basis, which created thousands of binding authorities all over the country. This is a very inefficient model for retail brokers. Now that we can much more easily accumulate and analyze data, that inefficiency has become more evident than ever, and we view the consolidation of these fragmented binding authorities and intermediaries as inevitable.\n With the addition of All Risks last year, we now have a more robust infrastructure and an enhanced talent base for delegated underwriting authority firmly in place. Now we just need to continue to execute just as we've done every day. If we do what we do best, recruit and empower talent, train young professionals and make prudent strategic acquisitions, we believe we'll be on pace to build the first truly 50-state Binding Authority operation. It's an exciting time in our industry, and we are well prepared for it.\n Our Underwriting Management specialty also produced another excellent quarter led by our property and casualty lines as well as our transactional liability and national programs all performing exceptionally well. I would also be remiss if I did not congratulate Miles Wuller on his promotion to Chief Executive Officer of our Underwriting Management specialty. Miles has been with Ryan Specialty from the beginning and was the natural choice to succeed Tom. Miles was already the President of Underwriting Management, intimately familiar with the business and has hit the ground running in his expanded role leading the specialty.\n As Pat mentioned, the environment for M&A remains highly competitive, particularly with respect to Underwriting Management. As we have always done, we will remain disciplined in our approach to M&A in each of these specialties. We're able to do this because of our tried and true positioning and strategy of successfully recruiting and retaining talent, as evidenced by our industry-leading producer retention figures. This has enabled us to firewall the trends of talent migration we're seeing in the industry and allows us to continue adding new specialized talent to our managing underwriting specialty, along with developing our current roster, in order to continue growing the business.\n We also continue to make steady progress at developing our new employee benefit specialty, which will be focusing on wholesale benefits brokerage and managing general underwriting capabilities to serve the needs of retail brokers. Pat and I are very pleased with the breadth of opportunities that are coming to market.\n Speaking of opportunities, our pipeline for M&A remains deep, as Pat noted, and we will continue to make disciplined investment decisions where we see clear opportunities to partner with successful specialty firms that are aligned with our goals, culture, values and expectations for organic growth. We were all very focused on the IPO in H1. And with it behind us, our M&A program is back in full focus. To put a point on it, today's acquisition is tomorrow's organic growth, and we hope to be back to you soon with more updates.\n In terms of the E&S market, pricing remains robust. While we are seeing rate deceleration in a couple of lines such as excess casualty, we also see hardening and price acceleration in other lines, most notably cyber. But as we've noted, we see the increasing flow of business into the E&S channel and the continued expansion of the non-admitted market as the more significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth. With these tailwinds, we're going to press our competitive advantages to continue to grow our business.\n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our third quarter. Thank you. \nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q3, we grew total revenue nearly 50% year-over-year to $353 million. Our strong top line increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 28.9% for the quarter and contributions from the All Risks acquisition for the months of July and August. As a reminder, All Risks became part of our organic revenue growth calculation beginning in September of this year. Our exceptional organic revenue growth is attributable to a combination of new client wins and expanding relationships with existing clients.\n Also picking up on Tim's comments from a moment ago, as more risks flow into the E&S channel, our total addressable market expands, which provides additional opportunities for organic growth. Our revenue growth was further enhanced by multiple classes of risks, realizing year-over-year premium rate increases, which drives increases in commission revenue since it's generally calculated as a percentage of total premium.\n Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $353 million, a 68% increase year-over-year. A large driver of this increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew 76% from the prior year period to $287 million in total. Now we expected this large increase in compensation expense for several reasons: first, compensation and benefits expense are heavily correlated to revenue growth as many of our producers are compensated based on a percentage of the revenue that they generate.\n Second, we incurred IPO-related compensation expense of $58 million in Q3. Now this number reflects multiple IPO-related events, including onetime payments made at the IPO, expense related to the revaluation of our pre-IPO equity awards, which includes additional expense recognized day 1, plus the first quarter of new expense related to those pre-IPO revalued awards. And it also includes the first period of expense related to new onetime IPO equity awards. And all of these, of course, were discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC at the time of the IPO.\n I should note also that the revaluation of the pre-IPO equity grant is a function of the fact that technically, there was an exchange of the old awards for new awards as part of the IPO. And as a reminder, these awards, along with all IPO-related employee equity grants, are included in our presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n We expect IPO-related compensation expense will decline by over 50% in Q4 relative to Q3 and then will continue to decline in future quarters as the equity awards are subject to a graded vesting schedule within our financial statements. And in the spirit of transparency, we've separated IPO-related compensation from our normal course equity-based compensation in the walk to adjusted EBITDAC.\n And finally, this quarter, we saw a large increase in acquisition-related long-term incentive comp, which is primarily due to the All Risks acquisition. And as we've stated before, we think of these as earnouts and that they are nonoperating in nature. Now despite the overall increase in our compensation and benefits expense, our adjusted comp and benefits expense ratio improved 260 basis points to 60.3% for the quarter, highlighting the scalability of our platform.\n Our G&A expense was up $7 million or 24% period-over-period due to an increase in travel and entertainment costs to support revenue expansion and new costs related to being a public company as well as costs associated with the All Risks business. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related expenses compared to the prior year period. Now we expect both T&E and public company costs will continue to rise over the next several quarters as T&E normalizes to something closer to the pre-COVID levels as our -- and as our public company costs roll into our results over the next 3 quarters.\n We note that adjusted EBITDAC for the quarter grew 56% year-over-year to $105 million, and our adjusted EBITDAC margin rose 140 basis points to 29.8% for the quarter. Primary drivers of this margin increase include our revenue growth leading to scale in adjusted comp and benefits as well as continued realization of cost savings from our restructuring plan, which we initiated in 2020. As noted previously, when fully actioned by June 30, 2022, we expect to achieve $25 million in cumulative annualized savings from this plan.\n As we think about adjusted EBITDAC margin in Q4 and for 2022, it bears repeating that we still expect a more normalized pre-pandemic level of T&E expense as the world returns to a broader level of in-person meetings and events. We will also have a full year of public company costs in 2022 and will, as always, continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, including the onboarding of additional talent. Over the medium and long term, we expect that our significant growth will yield sustainable operating leverage.\n GAAP net loss for Q3 2021 was $33 million and was primarily attributable to the $58 million of onetime IPO-related charges that I mentioned just moments ago. This quarter is our first quarter reporting EPS, and both basic and diluted loss per share were negative $0.16 for the period.\n Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO and other unusual expenses, increased 51% year-over-year to $62.9 million. Adjusted net income margin was 17.8%, a 20 basis point year-over-year improvement, reflecting operating leverage as revenue growth outpaced our growth in operating expenses. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.24 for the quarter and believe this metric provides a more comparable period-over-period measure for our operating performance. Please refer to the earnings release and our 10-Q where we further discuss the components of our adjusted diluted EPS.\n Given our strong Q3 results, we are raising our full year 2021 outlook for organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows: our organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2021 is now expected to be between 21.5% and 22.5%, which is above our previous guidance of 18% to 20%. As a reminder, with All Risks now part of our organic growth calculation, our organic growth comps will be more challenging going forward given the higher revenue base. Adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year 2021 is now forecasted to be between 31.5% and 32.0%. And this is up from our prior guidance of 30.0% to 30.5%.\n With that, we thank you for your time and would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Michael Zaremski with Wolfe Research. \nMichael Zaremski: I guess first question, which is a good issue to have, is organic just keeps being incredible, honestly. And I know you gave us some color -- a lot of color on the prepared remarks, but I guess, I'm trying to get at -- do you feel that there are certain drivers we should be thinking through a little bit more? Or is the total E&S market just kind of expanding more than maybe we appreciate? Or it may be at cyber or certain property in certain states we should be thinking about a little bit more? Because it feels like your win rate versus the industry or versus the E&S market is widening a little bit in recent quarters. \nPatrick Ryan: Now that is a great way to ask that question because we anticipated the question, obviously, but I like the way you asked it, Mike, because there are a lot of nuances. And so I'd like to ask Tim to answer the part about the areas of focus that are really expanding more rapidly than originally expected and are remaining very strong. \nTimothy Turner: Happy to. Thanks, Mike. The market, as we know, continues to expand in the non-admitted P&C market in North America. We get monthly stamping results from WSIA and all point to increase in non-admitted surplus lines business, more dumping and shedding from the standard companies here in the U.S. But inside that market, we have these niche-firming phenomenons that we've referred to several times. And some of those are really emerging today and driving a lot of this growth where we're very well positioned. Health care would be an example of that; construction; cyber very, very accelerated firming in the cyber market. Transportation continues to be a challenge in the U.S.\n And we're very well positioned in each of these specialties. We're deep in broking talent and deep in underwriting talent and very well prepared to absorb the new flow but to try and get market share at the same time. So very dynamic marketplace that we're in, and we're battling the very best E&S brokers and underwriters every day for that market share. \nPatrick Ryan: And then I would add to that, Mike, that the way you asked the question provides the opportunity for us to make sure we're focusing on the fact that we have these 2 specialties, wholesale broking and delegated authority, underwriting, admin and distribution. And they're similar in many ways, but there's also some differences. So the E&S market -- I mean, I'm sorry, our wholesale market, 71% of that is in the E&S market. The part that's not in the E&S market is workers' comp, auto. And of course, those have to be in the market by law.\n When you get to our delegated authority managing underwriting, our Binding Authority business is all in the E&S market but for comp and auto. We don't do a lot of comp in the binding. And then there's a part of the delegated authority that serves admitted products. It's just because of how those lines of business are distributed. So for example, M&A, reps and warranty, those are mostly admitted markets. There's more growth in the E&S market now because of the market conditions. But traditionally, they've been have been very much admitted market. \n And there are phenomenons in the delegated authority business because, as you know, in wholesale broking, our duty of care is to our retail broker. In managing underwriting, our duty of care is twofold. Our first primary duty of care is to the capital provider because they are giving us their pen, and they're relying on us to produce operating profits for them -- underwriting profits, I should say. We take that very seriously.\n So on the wholesale business, the brokers work hard to place that risk at whatever best terms they can get to serve our retail broker and their client. In the delegated authority where we're really doing very well, we have new leadership with Miles Wuller as the CEO, Nick Cortezi as the Chair, ably supported by Kieran Dempsey, our Chief Underwriting Officer, and a great team. They have to be very conscious of producing profits for the capital providers. And to sustain that business, which we are doing very well of, you better be producing profits for them or they'll change their appetite or change their underwriter.\n So it's important to be looking at that because there are just those nuances. Some other nuances that are really important is that when we got into the All Risks acquisition, we had a very strong position and program business. So we've had a legacy Ryan Specialty, great managing general underwriters and a growing Binding Authority business, but very little program business as it's defined in the industry. But that's changed dramatically with that acquisition.\n Now what happens in the program business is that these are all very specialty lines and markets get different appetites, competition comes in when prices are going up and you get more difficult competition, or people pull out. And we replaced the capital with new capital to the program but not new capital to us. So there's some nuance movement within the managing underwriting that I think is important to be aware of or keep aware of. I know you're all aware of it.\n So what we've done, and Tim has done this brilliantly, is when we started, we set up these practice group verticals where we specialize by line of business, by industry or by a combination of both. And we chose areas that are going to grow at our growth industries, construction, health care, energy, et cetera, real estate. And that's all paid off well. And a lot of those product lines have gotten quite difficult, professional lines across the board. Tim talked about cyber, but there's also a lot of economic influences in some of these lines.\n So you'll see in our numbers that there was a rebound last -- the fourth quarter of last year in the economy, so a lot of deferred building, construction, a lot of deferred M&A. So we had very strong quarters last year fourth quarter in M&A and in construction as well. Now our binding authorities suffered a bit during the lockdown because they were -- they're smaller businesses, a lot of hospitality. And there were bankruptcies. There were people pulling back, shutting down for quite a while. And so all of that started to move again during the year. So there was some catch-up not in terms of how it was accounted for but in terms of how it came to market because there was a lot of deferred activity.\n So as you're looking at '21, recognize that there was a boost in the economy that really took hold in the fourth quarter. And that's obviously continuing, but the boost in the economy has adjusted itself as it naturally would. So I'm glad you asked the question the way you did because it really is important for all of our investors to understand some of these nuances. \nMichael Zaremski: I appreciate the color, a lot for us to dig into. Maybe one quick follow-up, if I may, probably for Jeremiah. I'm sure people will focus on the -- in the Q&A on margins. But if I were to look at free cash flow conversion, it looks like it didn't -- maybe I'm nitpicking. It's been improved as much as a percentage of revenues. Is that something you guys are focusing on? And also, is 4Q still a seasonally weaker kind of a quarter for free cash flow? \nJeremiah Bickham: Mike, when you say -- when you quote the cash flow wasn't quite up to expectation, are -- what are you -- are you looking at cash flow from operation and taking out CapEx, like the traditional method? \nMichael Zaremski: So actually, I'm looking at our model. I'm doing free cash flow before a couple of items divided by rev. So I can follow up after to give you the stat. I guess -- I know there's no really consensus free cash flow numbers out there, but it did look a little bit weaker than we thought. So I know there's nuances in the quarter.\n I guess, maybe asked in another way, do you guys feel free cash flow was a little light versus kind of what you guys were expecting? Or is it just kind of firing on all cylinders and there's going to be nuances to that and there's -- nothing's really changed since kind of the -- what you guys told us during the IPO period in terms of how to think about things? \nJeremiah Bickham: So when you -- Mike, when you look at the -- our adjusted free cash flow, so taking out things like the IPO and our normal nonrecurring add-backs, we're very much on track, nothing out of the ordinary. Where people sometimes get off track trying to just do like one of the conventional cash -- free cash flow calculations is they look at cash from ops and take out CapEx. Remember that we inherited these basically earnout payments as liabilities with the All Risks acquisition. And as we pay those down, and we paid down $30 million -- $31 million of those LTIPs, but again, we think of as earnout in Q3, that comes out of operating cash flow, and that's really more of an investing cash flow. So with -- that adjustment alone probably adds a lot of normalcy to your calculation, I would imagine. \nMichael Zaremski: Yes, adjusting for that. Okay. \nPatrick Ryan: Sorry. Go ahead. \nMichael Zaremski: Sorry. Go ahead. \nPatrick Ryan: I was going to say, as you know, those payments were a brilliant plan by Nick Cortezi on retention of people, and they were part of the purchase price. So in effect, it's really the purchase price that's being -- or the deferred purchase price to retain the team. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Understood. I'll tweak our model. \nOperator: Next question, Adam Klauber with William Blair. \nAdam Klauber: Clearly, there's a lot of dislocation continuing in the property markets with all the weather and storms. Can you talk about, particularly in the Underwriting Management section, how you're helping to beat -- to meet demand there, and probably more obvious on the wholesale, if you could touch on that, too? But particularly in Underwriting Management, how are you helping clients ramp up for that dislocation? \nPatrick Ryan: I'll start that answer and then turn it to Tim. But we've been working diligently and vigorously all year to bring more capital into those facilities. And we've had -- we're having quite good success. You put your finger on it because a lot of people are pulling back, Adam, as you know, on their supportive property cat. But we -- in anticipation of that, I think our team has done well. We've been working to replace that.\n And Tim, why don't you pick up on that? \nTimothy Turner: Sure, Pat. Adam, great question. There's no doubt about the property market continuing to firm. It was already very firm, but these storms, like the Texas freeze and Ida, aspects of those storms were poorly modeled by many carriers. And so we see a constriction in the marketplace, more dumping and shedding from the standard markets, and we're ready for it. We're geared up for it. We have lots of very top-rated property brokers across the country. We're loaded up in the hubs. We can take a huge influx of property business coming into the channel. And as Pat mentioned, we've been building out our proprietary MGUs and underwriting platforms in cat property. So we're ready for it. We believe the first quarter heavy-buying season will increase the flow into our channel exponentially. So we're excited about it. We think we can bring even more value to our retail customers. \nAdam Klauber: Great. It seems like you're definitely at the right place at the right time. Any chance you could give us a magnitude of the capacity, even ballpark, that you've lined up? And do you think you'll be able to increase that capacity again that there's -- foreseeable, you could have a lot more demand next year. So yes, yes, if you could just add any color on that, that would be great. \nPatrick Ryan: I would just start, and then I'll turn it to Tim. We -- we've established a few years back as London was pulling back and a lot of our business have been -- particularly in the delegated authority, have been sourced into London, replacing them with European, U.S. and Bermuda capital, a little bit of Asia but mostly European, U.S. and Bermuda. And that's a lengthy process, Adam, as you know. And so it's a 2-plus-year project that we've spent a huge amount of time on all of '21. And that's what Tim was referring to is that the buying season in the first quarter, we're confident that we're going to be able to help our clients even more so than we have in the past as these needs are growing and the capital available is shifting. \nTimothy Turner: Just in addition to that, Adam, we have a myriad of platforms and facilities and cat property. So the largest MGU gem and true doubled their capacity over the last 12 months, so very, very well prepared and a deep, deep arsenal in our top MGU. But it's beyond that. We have multiple programs, property programs, cat programs embedded in the RT offices around the country. And of course, we have programs that we picked up from the All Risks acquisition that are very helpful as this market gets tougher in property.\n So it's a combination of those efforts, all led by a top fleet of property brokers across the country that do the battling upfront and get control of these marketing exercises. So we're very, very excited and think we can be an industry leader in capturing this new flow that's anticipated in the channel. \nAdam Klauber: Right. Well, good perspective. It sounds like that should be a very nice growth engine for time to come. \nOperator: Next question, Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Just a quick question on your updated guidance on organic revenue. I know you don't provide quarter-by-quarter guidance, but we could all calculate the implied 4Q being sequentially down. And I understand on a seasonality perspective, 1Q, 3Q are seasonally low on revenue, but 2Q and 4Q are seasonally higher. So maybe you could just help me understand what's behind the prudence of your implied 4Q organic revenue since you sound so upbeat about your business conditions. \nJeremiah Bickham: Definitely. So your math is correct, Tracy. The guidance does imply organic revenue growth for Q4 that's lower than Q2 and Q3. You probably got to the same math, mid-teens, which I'll explain in a minute, but I hope we all agree that in isolation, that's still a fantastic quarter in terms of organic revenue growth. But I know the heart of your question is it's different, and the answer is no. So our Q4 organic guidance does not represent a slowdown in flow or a significant change in market conditions, as you probably picked up from Tim and Pat's comments.\n So just to help break it down where we're coming from, so our Q4 last year was enormous, partially because of pent-up COVID demand, and Pat touched on that a little bit. But a good example of what we experienced in Q4 of 2020 was our 2 transactional liability MGUs had record quarters in Q4 of last year. And looking at Q4 this year, I mean, M&A is hard enough to forecast, and they're definitely not forecasting back-to-back record-breaking Q4s.\n And also, and this will be possibly thematic for us for a little while, the growth rate of 2 successive quarters doesn't necessarily imply a trend. So for example, our organic growth rate in Q1 this year was only 18%, but that was lower than our organic growth rate in Q4 of last year, which is 22%. But clearly, it would have been a mistake to extrapolate that because we've been 20-plus for the last 2 quarters.\n And in general, you mentioned prudence, Tracy. Look, clearly, our business is capable of growth rates much higher than mid-teens. And when the opportunity presents itself, we'll grab it. But those opportunities are often hard to predict. And you're right, it wouldn't be prudent of us to put that in the forecast.\n And so because our business is seasonal, because prior year comps are always a factor, we advise actually looking at growth trends on an annual basis, and that's why we give annual guidance versus quarterly guidance. And so to put it all together, we grew 20% organically on a full year basis in 2020, and we're on pace to exceed that exceptional annual growth rate in 2021 by potentially several hundred basis points, and we're really excited about that. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. Excellent. And then I also want to touch on delegated underwriting authority. You mentioned that you're constructive, you could be the first 50-state player. Can you just remind us how many states you're in now to better assess how transformative that may be? \nTimothy Turner: The Binding Authority is a wide range of products and appointments. So when we refer to a 50-state platform, it's multiline. So there's auto appointments in there. There's property and casualty appointments. There's package policy appointments. Dozens and dozens of carriers who are in the Binding Authority space and delegate that authority to us do so in a more and more in a 50-state approach, which, historically, as you know, was more of a state-by-state basis. So we've rolled that platform up, and we continue to collect these 50-state appointments.\n So today, we're equipped and we have enough product in 50 states where we can RFP with top 100 retail clients in the hopes and anticipation of participating in the consolidation of the use of those fragmented intermediaries. So getting in position, having enough product on the shelf, so to speak, was all part of this 50-state phenomenon.\n And as history would show, carriers had to respond to this repositioning, if you will. So lead carriers like Scottsdale, Nationwide, AIG changed their platforms and went to these 50-state distribution models. So all of that has really come together nicely for us and to position ourselves in a very strong way to the client. So being licensed in 50 states becomes a really important issue. And we're -- we have a lot of depth and breadth with the underwriters in every state now. \nOperator: Next question, Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, you guys also seem pretty positive just on the M&A outlook. I think you used the words like you hope to be back soon with more updates. Can you just give us a sense of what the pipeline looks like in terms of just size of deals and which part of your businesses you think you might be the most active when it comes to M&A? \nPatrick Ryan: Sure. As we said, the pipeline is robust. We're in various stages of development with several great opportunities, and they tend to be pretty consistent with what we've done in the past. There are a few smaller ones, but -- I mean, a couple, but they're very strategic because they involve one of our big retail clients that will enhance our overall relationship together.\n And then we, of course, have started the new vertical in terms of benefits. And there are discussions. We're optimistic. It's just difficult to calibrate when they emerge into a binding agreement. And when we have a binding agreement, generally, that's when we announce. Sometimes it might be earlier. But generally, it's when we have a binding agreement. And so those are being worked, and there's no certainty. Some of those could be a little larger and then -- especially wholesale opportunities at our stages of discussion.\n So just generally, we're quite optimistic that we can sustain our past record of M&A activity. But we actually feel because of all of our growth and success but also the IPO that we've got an enhanced brand and that more people are -- we're getting more calls from people, from sellers. And then they hire a banker or we help them find a banker just to get the proper advice. But no, we're very comfortable with where we are in the M&A activity. \nTimothy Turner: And Elyse, just for the sake of clarity, when Pat references a binding agreement, we are talking about a definitive purchase agreement, not an LOI. I know some people will report on LOIs. That's not our plan. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question. You guys continue to show a pretty robust margin improvement. I know, Jeremiah, you mentioned some of that is COVID, which you don't expect to continue. But I imagine that some of that is also just better leverage given stronger revenue growth. So as we think about 2022, has the kind of margin base been lifted? I know you guys have kind of spoken about targeting a margin within the vicinity of 30. Has the strong revenue growth perhaps opted out margin somewhat? \nJeremiah Bickham: So you've got a good memory, Elyse. So aside from our commitment to continually invest in our business, there will be 2 impactful themes for next year in terms of margin, and that's returning to, god-willing, a normal T&E environment and the annualization of our public company costs. It's a correct observation that the outsized growth these quarters has yielded operating leverage, and we think that we can retain some of that. But we're going to be as helpful and transparent as we can when we release guidance for 2022 next spring when we put out our audit because you will see an impact of T&E coming back to normal and us having a full year of public company costs. \nOperator: Next question, Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. \nAlex Scott: First one I had to you is just the infrastructure bill. I was just interested if you could help us think through the impact of that bill and potential opportunities for growth that you'll see out of that. \nPatrick Ryan: Sure. We hope a lot of that infrastructure bill gets spent in terms of construction because we all know, the country needs a lot of investment in infrastructure. It's hard to predict how the politicians will roll out that bill and where the money will get allocated early and then later. We hope that they're alert to investing. And you'll recall backing away, pulling on a shovel-ready. We hope we don't have a repeat shovel-ready and that there's really a serious construction investment, bridges, tunnels, airports, lots of private investment. We expect that really, but there's no way of knowing.\n But because of the scale of it, it ought to be a material impact on areas of business that we focus in on. We have a very strong construction practice, and we have a lot of infrastructure capability. So they're saying they're going to invest in one of our sweet spots. We just hope that they do it quickly. \nAlex Scott: And I guess, follow-up I had was on the All Risks transaction. And just as that starts to come into organic growth in a more full way, I guess, starting next quarter, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of the way that business is growing versus the existing business and sort of thinking through what that could look like over the next few quarters? \nPatrick Ryan: Yes. I would start and then turn it to Jeremiah. There's always a period of -- on an acquisition of some loss of business that we price into the purchase price -- we factor in the purchase price, I should say. And that's all basically taken place. The good news is that All Risks, because of their great talent pool and wonderful franchises, has not had a big digesting period in terms of acquisition adjustments. There are no water coolers to stand around. So that hasn't happened, but frankly, the people have been just fantastic in joining the team.\n So right now, as we're here in the fourth quarter, they're at full stride. And there's precious little difference between our RT wholesale and legacy and All Risks. So exactly what we had hoped for has unfolded. And frankly, the period of digestion was much shorter than most transactions. They joined the team quickly, emotionally, physically. And so we're very pleased with the early results. And now we are into our second year, as you know. \nOperator: Next question, Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Two quick questions. First is, I think, a follow-up on Elyse's. When you've got a quarter like this one where it's almost impossible to maintain investments at the same pace as organic growth, does that imply a catch-up in investments that we should factor into future quarters' margins? \nPatrick Ryan: I'd like to start with that, and I'll let Tim pick it up. But one of the things that Tim has done really well and influencing also the managing underwriters is to anticipate the growth and hire ahead of it. So you've heard us say in the past, this is not just a quality business. This is a quality and quantity business. You need the numbers of people to serve your clients. And Tim, in anticipation of the market happening back in '19, urged the teams to hire, hire, hire. And they did. So there hasn't been any -- a little spike. There's been a gradual buildup but sizable of adding staff.\n So we think we're well prepared, but Tim, you pick it up from there. \nTimothy Turner: Sure. Thanks, Pat. Meyer, right from the get-go in 2010, part of our culture was this commitment to constantly be recruiting, constantly training and developing. So it's a part of our daily life. Not a day goes by that we're not trying to recruit a broker or an underwriting specialist. There's days where we bring a half a dozen new people on at a time. So it's constant, aggressively recruiting and developing talent. And that's worked really well for us.\n We've got great metrics. We've got a great management team that helps us manage and balance those expenses. But we do very well, if I might say so myself, in terms of anticipating this growth and these surges of flow into the channel. And so as Pat mentioned, in the first and second quarter of '19, we saw the market firming. We saw the percentage of not have been in business don't being into the channel. But more specifically, we saw it by class. We saw it by region, and we were able to accelerate and add people to capture as much of that business as we could.\n So we'll continue to do that. We have lots of opportunities. As Pat mentioned, we're more attractive now to the talent in the industry. Going public has made us even more attractive. And so aspects of that recruiting are getting a little easier. And we'll continue to bring in the most talented brokers and underwriters in the country. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. That was very helpful. Second question, same sort of concept. When you've got organic growth coming in so significantly ahead of guidance, are there any catch-up incentive compensation expenses? Obviously, the overall ratio went down, but wondering whether there are any timing issues related to a look back at the first or second quarter of this year. \nJeremiah Bickham: Any compensation -- we call it gearing. I know people call it different things, but when people sort of exceed their baseline bonus for outperformance, and there's been some outperformance this year, Meyer, that's all factored into the guidance we're giving you for the full year. \nOperator: Your final question comes from Weston Bloomer with UBS. \nWeston Bloomer: My first question is a follow-up on Alex' question on All Risks. If I run the math, it looks like that business grew kind of high single digits. And now that is inorganic. Is there a level of organic that we can think about for that business longer term? Or am I thinking about it wrong and to more think about kind of how synergy -- how it can provide synergies across different business lines? Because I do think it might be growing a little bit slower at this point. \nTimothy Turner: Pat gave some good context on All Risks specifically and then just sort of what the first 12 months are often like for a new acquisition, but we're excited about welcoming them into our organic growth calculation. I mean when you add several hundred million of revenue to the base, it makes comps tougher.\n But remember, All Risks, one of the reasons they were the crown jewel of wholesale acquisitions is because they had a very, very strong organic growth engine of themselves. They were consistent double-digit growers before we bought them. And generally, when we buy companies, we enhance their growth opportunities, not the opposite. So we're not expecting All Risks to be a drag at all, like... \nPatrick Ryan: Not a drag right now at all. \nTimothy Turner: Exactly. Yes. \nWeston Bloomer: Got it. Second question, just a follow-up on the new hires commentary. Is there a time period where the new producers or either from M&A or just as you make new hires like are a positive benefit to margin? And how should we think about that over the next year or 2? \nJeremiah Bickham: Well, each hire is a little bit different from the next, but we pride ourselves in accelerating their ability to be accretive. And we have models to look at that and analyze it, but they come in different shapes and sizes, different state regulations that restrict us in terms of moving business. So we look at each one of those separately. But the key is to accelerate the accretive impact of these producers and underwriters as quick as possible. And we've done that consistently, and we plan to continue to do that. \nOperator: I would like to turn the floor over to Pat for closing remarks. \nPatrick Ryan: Okay. Well, thank you for the great questions. And we're very confident of our future. We feel really grateful for you following our business and your interest in joining us and investing with us, and look forward to speaking with you again when we will be discussing our year-end results for 2021. The year has gone very quickly.\n Thanks for your interest and your good questions. Have a good evening. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Jeremiah Bickham",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. In Q3, we grew total revenue nearly 50% year-over-year to $353 million. Our strong top line increase was driven by organic revenue growth of 28.9% for the quarter and contributions from the All Risks acquisition for the months of July and August. As a reminder, All Risks became part of our organic revenue growth calculation beginning in September of this year. Our exceptional organic revenue growth is attributable to a combination of new client wins and expanding relationships with existing clients.\n Also picking up on Tim's comments from a moment ago, as more risks flow into the E&S channel, our total addressable market expands, which provides additional opportunities for organic growth. Our revenue growth was further enhanced by multiple classes of risks, realizing year-over-year premium rate increases, which drives increases in commission revenue since it's generally calculated as a percentage of total premium.\n Total operating expenses for the third quarter were $353 million, a 68% increase year-over-year. A large driver of this increase was compensation and benefits expense, which grew 76% from the prior year period to $287 million in total. Now we expected this large increase in compensation expense for several reasons: first, compensation and benefits expense are heavily correlated to revenue growth as many of our producers are compensated based on a percentage of the revenue that they generate.\n Second, we incurred IPO-related compensation expense of $58 million in Q3. Now this number reflects multiple IPO-related events, including onetime payments made at the IPO, expense related to the revaluation of our pre-IPO equity awards, which includes additional expense recognized day 1, plus the first quarter of new expense related to those pre-IPO revalued awards. And it also includes the first period of expense related to new onetime IPO equity awards. And all of these, of course, were discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC at the time of the IPO.\n I should note also that the revaluation of the pre-IPO equity grant is a function of the fact that technically, there was an exchange of the old awards for new awards as part of the IPO. And as a reminder, these awards, along with all IPO-related employee equity grants, are included in our presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n We expect IPO-related compensation expense will decline by over 50% in Q4 relative to Q3 and then will continue to decline in future quarters as the equity awards are subject to a graded vesting schedule within our financial statements. And in the spirit of transparency, we've separated IPO-related compensation from our normal course equity-based compensation in the walk to adjusted EBITDAC.\n And finally, this quarter, we saw a large increase in acquisition-related long-term incentive comp, which is primarily due to the All Risks acquisition. And as we've stated before, we think of these as earnouts and that they are nonoperating in nature. Now despite the overall increase in our compensation and benefits expense, our adjusted comp and benefits expense ratio improved 260 basis points to 60.3% for the quarter, highlighting the scalability of our platform.\n Our G&A expense was up $7 million or 24% period-over-period due to an increase in travel and entertainment costs to support revenue expansion and new costs related to being a public company as well as costs associated with the All Risks business. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related expenses compared to the prior year period. Now we expect both T&E and public company costs will continue to rise over the next several quarters as T&E normalizes to something closer to the pre-COVID levels as our -- and as our public company costs roll into our results over the next 3 quarters.\n We note that adjusted EBITDAC for the quarter grew 56% year-over-year to $105 million, and our adjusted EBITDAC margin rose 140 basis points to 29.8% for the quarter. Primary drivers of this margin increase include our revenue growth leading to scale in adjusted comp and benefits as well as continued realization of cost savings from our restructuring plan, which we initiated in 2020. As noted previously, when fully actioned by June 30, 2022, we expect to achieve $25 million in cumulative annualized savings from this plan.\n As we think about adjusted EBITDAC margin in Q4 and for 2022, it bears repeating that we still expect a more normalized pre-pandemic level of T&E expense as the world returns to a broader level of in-person meetings and events. We will also have a full year of public company costs in 2022 and will, as always, continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, including the onboarding of additional talent. Over the medium and long term, we expect that our significant growth will yield sustainable operating leverage.\n GAAP net loss for Q3 2021 was $33 million and was primarily attributable to the $58 million of onetime IPO-related charges that I mentioned just moments ago. This quarter is our first quarter reporting EPS, and both basic and diluted loss per share were negative $0.16 for the period.\n Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO and other unusual expenses, increased 51% year-over-year to $62.9 million. Adjusted net income margin was 17.8%, a 20 basis point year-over-year improvement, reflecting operating leverage as revenue growth outpaced our growth in operating expenses. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.24 for the quarter and believe this metric provides a more comparable period-over-period measure for our operating performance. Please refer to the earnings release and our 10-Q where we further discuss the components of our adjusted diluted EPS.\n Given our strong Q3 results, we are raising our full year 2021 outlook for organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows: our organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2021 is now expected to be between 21.5% and 22.5%, which is above our previous guidance of 18% to 20%. As a reminder, with All Risks now part of our organic growth calculation, our organic growth comps will be more challenging going forward given the higher revenue base. Adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year 2021 is now forecasted to be between 31.5% and 32.0%. And this is up from our prior guidance of 30.0% to 30.5%.\n With that, we thank you for your time and would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Mike, when you say -- when you quote the cash flow wasn't quite up to expectation, are -- what are you -- are you looking at cash flow from operation and taking out CapEx, like the traditional method? So when you -- Mike, when you look at the -- our adjusted free cash flow, so taking out things like the IPO and our normal nonrecurring add-backs, we're very much on track, nothing out of the ordinary. Where people sometimes get off track trying to just do like one of the conventional cash -- free cash flow calculations is they look at cash from ops and take out CapEx. Remember that we inherited these basically earnout payments as liabilities with the All Risks acquisition. And as we pay those down, and we paid down $30 million -- $31 million of those LTIPs, but again, we think of as earnout in Q3, that comes out of operating cash flow, and that's really more of an investing cash flow. So with -- that adjustment alone probably adds a lot of normalcy to your calculation, I would imagine. Definitely. So your math is correct, Tracy. The guidance does imply organic revenue growth for Q4 that's lower than Q2 and Q3. You probably got to the same math, mid-teens, which I'll explain in a minute, but I hope we all agree that in isolation, that's still a fantastic quarter in terms of organic revenue growth. But I know the heart of your question is it's different, and the answer is no. So our Q4 organic guidance does not represent a slowdown in flow or a significant change in market conditions, as you probably picked up from Tim and Pat's comments.\n So just to help break it down where we're coming from, so our Q4 last year was enormous, partially because of pent-up COVID demand, and Pat touched on that a little bit.

But clearly, it would have been a mistake to extrapolate that because we've been 20-plus for the last 2 quarters.\n And in general, you mentioned prudence, Tracy. Look, clearly, our business is capable of growth rates much higher than mid-teens. And when the opportunity presents itself, we'll grab it. But those opportunities are often hard to predict.

            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. On today's call, I will provide a brief overview of the quarter and our differentiated business model. Our President, Tim Turner, will then give an update on each of our 3 specialties. And finally, our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham, will walk you through the details of the quarter, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.\n We had an excellent quarter, which was our first quarter as a public company and a testament to our great team. We executed well on all facets of our business and grew our top line by nearly 50%. The majority of that growth was accomplished organically. This type of organic growth rate is seldom seen in the industry and is clear evidence of the differentiated value that the Ryan Specialty platform provides to its new and existing clients.\n Our team continues to demonstrate its talent and expertise to deliver critical solutions to our trading partners in placing these complex risks. It's vital to be a subject matter expert and to specialize in the product, the industry or both. And for us, that expertise is evident in our wholesale and our delegated underwriting authority specialties.\n We also continue to grow our bottom line, leading to another quarter of strong adjusted EBITDAC and expanding margins compared to the prior year period. We have a firm handle on our business. We continue to be the destination of choice with the best talent in our industry. And we are in a prime position to sustainably grow Ryan Specialty at an impressive pace for years to come.\n As we near the end of 2021, we continue to see strong trends in our industry. The $65-plus billion E&S market continues to expand faster than the admitted market as the complexity of risks continues to grow. This requires experience and knowledgeable producers and underwriters to guide clients with innovative and customized solutions. That's our power rally. Innovation is in our DNA. It provides us with a long-term opportunity to grow both sustainably and profitably.\n Pricing in the E&S market remains firm and resilient. And as a reminder, our model is built to outperform in any pricing environment. Retail broker panels and delegated underwriting authority remain fragmented to a very large extent, and a significant amount of consolidation has yet to occur. This will lead to a continued movement by retailers towards a singular solution for the E&S needs, which we are well positioned to serve. And our pipeline for M&A remains robust, and we continue to have productive conversations with potential targets to add to our platform. We will remain very active but disciplined with respect to M&A, and we'll execute only when the opportunity is right.\n Our independent, full-service model, scaled distribution platform and deep bench of experts gives us a clear advantage compared to our competition. We believe we have the most comprehensive product access, underwriting knowledge and extensive distribution network for both retail insurance brokers and carriers. This has enabled us to become a preferred and trusted partner. We're 97th of the top 100 retail insurance brokers in the country.\n Notably, we continue to prioritize our recruitment, development and retention of the top talent in the industry. We constantly recruit the most talented individuals to join Ryan Specialty, empower them to contribute diverse perspectives and thought leadership and enable them to become an integral part of our winning culture. As a result, they have incredible opportunities to succeed and are very well rewarded for their contributions.\n Looking ahead, our growth plans remain firmly intact, and we are well positioned to execute on them. As I noted on our prior call, we will continue to methodically invest in our growth and ensure Ryan Specialty remains a destination of choice for the industry's top-tier talent.\n We will continue to lead with innovation to meet the ever-changing needs of the market. We will continue to expand and deepen our relationships with our current clients as well as continue to win new clients. We will further enhance our future organic growth capabilities by executing strategically and prudently on M&A.\n In summary, I'm very proud of our team's tremendous efforts in the third quarter. Our dedication, empowered by our winning culture, has clearly contributed to our positive performance results. They continue to validate our business model and our value proposition to our trading partners. I remain very excited for the future growth of our company and our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.\n With that now, I'm very pleased to turn the call over to our President, Tim Turner. Tim? Now that is a great way to ask that question because we anticipated the question, obviously, but I like the way you asked it, Mike, because there are a lot of nuances. And so I'd like to ask Tim to answer the part about the areas of focus that are really expanding more rapidly than originally expected and are remaining very strong. And then I would add to that, Mike, that the way you asked the question provides the opportunity for us to make sure we're focusing on the fact that we have these 2 specialties, wholesale broking and delegated authority, underwriting, admin and distribution. And they're similar in many ways, but there's also some differences. So the E&S market -- I mean, I'm sorry, our wholesale market, 71% of that is in the E&S market. The part that's not in the E&S market is workers' comp, auto. And of course, those have to be in the market by law.\n When you get to our delegated authority managing underwriting, our Binding Authority business is all in the E&S market but for comp and auto. We don't do a lot of comp in the binding. And then there's a part of the delegated authority that serves admitted products. It's just because of how those lines of business are distributed. So for example, M&A, reps and warranty, those are mostly admitted markets. There's more growth in the E&S market now because of the market conditions. But traditionally, they've been have been very much admitted market. \n And there are phenomenons in the delegated authority business because, as you know, in wholesale broking, our duty of care is to our retail broker. In managing underwriting, our duty of care is twofold. Our first primary duty of care is to the capital provider because they are giving us their pen, and they're relying on us to produce operating profits for them -- underwriting profits, I should say. We take that very seriously.\n So on the wholesale business, the brokers work hard to place that risk at whatever best terms they can get to serve our retail broker and their client. In the delegated authority where we're really doing very well, we have new leadership with Miles Wuller as the CEO, Nick Cortezi as the Chair, ably supported by Kieran Dempsey, our Chief Underwriting Officer, and a great team. They have to be very conscious of producing profits for the capital providers. And to sustain that business, which we are doing very well of, you better be producing profits for them or they'll change their appetite or change their underwriter.\n So it's important to be looking at that because there are just those nuances. Some other nuances that are really important is that when we got into the All Risks acquisition, we had a very strong position and program business. So we've had a legacy Ryan Specialty, great managing general underwriters and a growing Binding Authority business, but very little program business as it's defined in the industry. But that's changed dramatically with that acquisition.\n Now what happens in the program business is that these are all very specialty lines and markets get different appetites, competition comes in when prices are going up and you get more difficult competition, or people pull out. And we replaced the capital with new capital to the program but not new capital to us. So there's some nuance movement within the managing underwriting that I think is important to be aware of or keep aware of. I know you're all aware of it.\n So what we've done, and Tim has done this brilliantly, is when we started, we set up these practice group verticals where we specialize by line of business, by industry or by a combination of both. And we chose areas that are going to grow at our growth industries, construction, health care, energy, et cetera, real estate. And that's all paid off well. And a lot of those product lines have gotten quite difficult, professional lines across the board. Tim talked about cyber, but there's also a lot of economic influences in some of these lines.\n So you'll see in our numbers that there was a rebound last -- the fourth quarter of last year in the economy, so a lot of deferred building, construction, a lot of deferred M&A. So we had very strong quarters last year fourth quarter in M&A and in construction as well. Now our binding authorities suffered a bit during the lockdown because they were -- they're smaller businesses, a lot of hospitality. And there were bankruptcies. There were people pulling back, shutting down for quite a while. And so all of that started to move again during the year. So there was some catch-up not in terms of how it was accounted for but in terms of how it came to market because there was a lot of deferred activity.\n So as you're looking at '21, recognize that there was a boost in the economy that really took hold in the fourth quarter. And that's obviously continuing, but the boost in the economy has adjusted itself as it naturally would. So I'm glad you asked the question the way you did because it really is important for all of our investors to understand some of these nuances. Sorry. Go ahead. I was going to say, as you know, those payments were a brilliant plan by Nick Cortezi on retention of people, and they were part of the purchase price. So in effect, it's really the purchase price that's being -- or the deferred purchase price to retain the team. I'll start that answer and then turn it to Tim. But we've been working diligently and vigorously all year to bring more capital into those facilities. And we've had -- we're having quite good success. You put your finger on it because a lot of people are pulling back, Adam, as you know, on their supportive property cat. But we -- in anticipation of that, I think our team has done well. We've been working to replace that.\n And Tim, why don't you pick up on that? I would just start, and then I'll turn it to Tim. We -- we've established a few years back as London was pulling back and a lot of our business have been -- particularly in the delegated authority, have been sourced into London, replacing them with European, U.S. and Bermuda capital, a little bit of Asia but mostly European, U.S. and Bermuda. And that's a lengthy process, Adam, as you know. And so it's a 2-plus-year project that we've spent a huge amount of time on all of '21. And that's what Tim was referring to is that the buying season in the first quarter, we're confident that we're going to be able to help our clients even more so than we have in the past as these needs are growing and the capital available is shifting. Sure. As we said, the pipeline is robust. We're in various stages of development with several great opportunities, and they tend to be pretty consistent with what we've done in the past. There are a few smaller ones, but -- I mean, a couple, but they're very strategic because they involve one of our big retail clients that will enhance our overall relationship together.\n And then we, of course, have started the new vertical in terms of benefits. And there are discussions. We're optimistic. It's just difficult to calibrate when they emerge into a binding agreement. And when we have a binding agreement, generally, that's when we announce. Sometimes it might be earlier. But generally, it's when we have a binding agreement. And so those are being worked, and there's no certainty. Some of those could be a little larger and then -- especially wholesale opportunities at our stages of discussion.\n So just generally, we're quite optimistic that we can sustain our past record of M&A activity. But we actually feel because of all of our growth and success but also the IPO that we've got an enhanced brand and that more people are -- we're getting more calls from people, from sellers. And then they hire a banker or we help them find a banker just to get the proper advice. But no, we're very comfortable with where we are in the M&A activity. Sure. We hope a lot of that infrastructure bill gets spent in terms of construction because we all know, the country needs a lot of investment in infrastructure. It's hard to predict how the politicians will roll out that bill and where the money will get allocated early and then later. We hope that they're alert to investing. And you'll recall backing away, pulling on a shovel-ready. We hope we don't have a repeat shovel-ready and that there's really a serious construction investment, bridges, tunnels, airports, lots of private investment. We expect that really, but there's no way of knowing.\n But because of the scale of it, it ought to be a material impact on areas of business that we focus in on. We have a very strong construction practice, and we have a lot of infrastructure capability. So they're saying they're going to invest in one of our sweet spots. We just hope that they do it quickly. Yes. I would start and then turn it to Jeremiah. There's always a period of -- on an acquisition of some loss of business that we price into the purchase price -- we factor in the purchase price, I should say. And that's all basically taken place. The good news is that All Risks, because of their great talent pool and wonderful franchises, has not had a big digesting period in terms of acquisition adjustments. There are no water coolers to stand around. So that hasn't happened, but frankly, the people have been just fantastic in joining the team.\n So right now, as we're here in the fourth quarter, they're at full stride. And there's precious little difference between our RT wholesale and legacy and All Risks. So exactly what we had hoped for has unfolded. And frankly, the period of digestion was much shorter than most transactions. They joined the team quickly, emotionally, physically. And so we're very pleased with the early results. And now we are into our second year, as you know. I'd like to start with that, and I'll let Tim pick it up. But one of the things that Tim has done really well and influencing also the managing underwriters is to anticipate the growth and hire ahead of it. So you've heard us say in the past, this is not just a quality business. This is a quality and quantity business. You need the numbers of people to serve your clients. And Tim, in anticipation of the market happening back in '19, urged the teams to hire, hire, hire. And they did. So there hasn't been any -- a little spike. There's been a gradual buildup but sizable of adding staff.\n So we think we're well prepared, but Tim, you pick it up from there. Not a drag right now at all. Okay. Well, thank you for the great questions. And we're very confident of our future. We feel really grateful for you following our business and your interest in joining us and investing with us, and look forward to speaking with you again when we will be discussing our year-end results for 2021. The year has gone very quickly.\n Thanks for your interest and your good questions. Have a good evening."

            "name": "Timothy Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. As Pat highlighted, we had an outstanding quarter, and our success was broad-based across our 3 specialties. \n Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty is where we distribute a wide range and diversified mix of specialty insurance products and solutions from insurance carriers to retail brokerage firms. We experienced solid growth across property and casualty lines and especially in professional liability lines of business. This growth was driven by our continued strong performance in this prolonged hard market, combined with an increasing flow of business into the E&S channel.\n At our Binding Authority specialty, we continue to see strong growth within our small commercial lines of business. In addition, on our prior call, we noted the tremendous opportunity to address the highly fragmented delegated authority market where both M&A and panel consolidation are in their very early stages. For decades, companies that delegated binding authority did so on a state-by-state or geographical basis, which created thousands of binding authorities all over the country. This is a very inefficient model for retail brokers. Now that we can much more easily accumulate and analyze data, that inefficiency has become more evident than ever, and we view the consolidation of these fragmented binding authorities and intermediaries as inevitable.\n With the addition of All Risks last year, we now have a more robust infrastructure and an enhanced talent base for delegated underwriting authority firmly in place. Now we just need to continue to execute just as we've done every day. If we do what we do best, recruit and empower talent, train young professionals and make prudent strategic acquisitions, we believe we'll be on pace to build the first truly 50-state Binding Authority operation. It's an exciting time in our industry, and we are well prepared for it.\n Our Underwriting Management specialty also produced another excellent quarter led by our property and casualty lines as well as our transactional liability and national programs all performing exceptionally well. I would also be remiss if I did not congratulate Miles Wuller on his promotion to Chief Executive Officer of our Underwriting Management specialty. Miles has been with Ryan Specialty from the beginning and was the natural choice to succeed Tom. Miles was already the President of Underwriting Management, intimately familiar with the business and has hit the ground running in his expanded role leading the specialty.\n As Pat mentioned, the environment for M&A remains highly competitive, particularly with respect to Underwriting Management. As we have always done, we will remain disciplined in our approach to M&A in each of these specialties. We're able to do this because of our tried and true positioning and strategy of successfully recruiting and retaining talent, as evidenced by our industry-leading producer retention figures. This has enabled us to firewall the trends of talent migration we're seeing in the industry and allows us to continue adding new specialized talent to our managing underwriting specialty, along with developing our current roster, in order to continue growing the business.\n We also continue to make steady progress at developing our new employee benefit specialty, which will be focusing on wholesale benefits brokerage and managing general underwriting capabilities to serve the needs of retail brokers. Pat and I are very pleased with the breadth of opportunities that are coming to market.\n Speaking of opportunities, our pipeline for M&A remains deep, as Pat noted, and we will continue to make disciplined investment decisions where we see clear opportunities to partner with successful specialty firms that are aligned with our goals, culture, values and expectations for organic growth. We were all very focused on the IPO in H1. And with it behind us, our M&A program is back in full focus. To put a point on it, today's acquisition is tomorrow's organic growth, and we hope to be back to you soon with more updates.\n In terms of the E&S market, pricing remains robust. While we are seeing rate deceleration in a couple of lines such as excess casualty, we also see hardening and price acceleration in other lines, most notably cyber. But as we've noted, we see the increasing flow of business into the E&S channel and the continued expansion of the non-admitted market as the more significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth. With these tailwinds, we're going to press our competitive advantages to continue to grow our business.\n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our third quarter. Thank you. Happy to. Thanks, Mike. The market, as we know, continues to expand in the non-admitted P&C market in North America. We get monthly stamping results from WSIA and all point to increase in non-admitted surplus lines business, more dumping and shedding from the standard companies here in the U.S. But inside that market, we have these niche-firming phenomenons that we've referred to several times. And some of those are really emerging today and driving a lot of this growth where we're very well positioned. Health care would be an example of that; construction; cyber very, very accelerated firming in the cyber market. Transportation continues to be a challenge in the U.S.\n And we're very well positioned in each of these specialties. We're deep in broking talent and deep in underwriting talent and very well prepared to absorb the new flow but to try and get market share at the same time. So very dynamic marketplace that we're in, and we're battling the very best E&S brokers and underwriters every day for that market share. Sure, Pat. Adam, great question. There's no doubt about the property market continuing to firm. It was already very firm, but these storms, like the Texas freeze and Ida, aspects of those storms were poorly modeled by many carriers. And so we see a constriction in the marketplace, more dumping and shedding from the standard markets, and we're ready for it. We're geared up for it. We have lots of very top-rated property brokers across the country. We're loaded up in the hubs. We can take a huge influx of property business coming into the channel. And as Pat mentioned, we've been building out our proprietary MGUs and underwriting platforms in cat property. So we're ready for it. We believe the first quarter heavy-buying season will increase the flow into our channel exponentially. So we're excited about it. We think we can bring even more value to our retail customers. Just in addition to that, Adam, we have a myriad of platforms and facilities and cat property. So the largest MGU gem and true doubled their capacity over the last 12 months, so very, very well prepared and a deep, deep arsenal in our top MGU. But it's beyond that. We have multiple programs, property programs, cat programs embedded in the RT offices around the country. And of course, we have programs that we picked up from the All Risks acquisition that are very helpful as this market gets tougher in property.\n So it's a combination of those efforts, all led by a top fleet of property brokers across the country that do the battling upfront and get control of these marketing exercises. So we're very, very excited and think we can be an industry leader in capturing this new flow that's anticipated in the channel. The Binding Authority is a wide range of products and appointments. So when we refer to a 50-state platform, it's multiline. So there's auto appointments in there. There's property and casualty appointments. There's package policy appointments. Dozens and dozens of carriers who are in the Binding Authority space and delegate that authority to us do so in a more and more in a 50-state approach, which, historically, as you know, was more of a state-by-state basis. So we've rolled that platform up, and we continue to collect these 50-state appointments.\n So today, we're equipped and we have enough product in 50 states where we can RFP with top 100 retail clients in the hopes and anticipation of participating in the consolidation of the use of those fragmented intermediaries. So getting in position, having enough product on the shelf, so to speak, was all part of this 50-state phenomenon.\n And as history would show, carriers had to respond to this repositioning, if you will. So lead carriers like Scottsdale, Nationwide, AIG changed their platforms and went to these 50-state distribution models. So all of that has really come together nicely for us and to position ourselves in a very strong way to the client. So being licensed in 50 states becomes a really important issue. And we're -- we have a lot of depth and breadth with the underwriters in every state now. And Elyse, just for the sake of clarity, when Pat references a binding agreement, we are talking about a definitive purchase agreement, not an LOI. I know some people will report on LOIs. That's not our plan. Sure. Thanks, Pat. Meyer, right from the get-go in 2010, part of our culture was this commitment to constantly be recruiting, constantly training and developing. So it's a part of our daily life. Not a day goes by that we're not trying to recruit a broker or an underwriting specialist. There's days where we bring a half a dozen new people on at a time. So it's constant, aggressively recruiting and developing talent. And that's worked really well for us.\n We've got great metrics. We've got a great management team that helps us manage and balance those expenses. But we do very well, if I might say so myself, in terms of anticipating this growth and these surges of flow into the channel. And so as Pat mentioned, in the first and second quarter of '19, we saw the market firming. We saw the percentage of not have been in business don't being into the channel. But more specifically, we saw it by class. We saw it by region, and we were able to accelerate and add people to capture as much of that business as we could.\n So we'll continue to do that. We have lots of opportunities. As Pat mentioned, we're more attractive now to the talent in the industry. Going public has made us even more attractive. And so aspects of that recruiting are getting a little easier. And we'll continue to bring in the most talented brokers and underwriters in the country. Pat gave some good context on All Risks specifically and then just sort of what the first 12 months are often like for a new acquisition, but we're excited about welcoming them into our organic growth calculation. I mean when you add several hundred million of revenue to the base, it makes comps tougher.\n But remember, All Risks, one of the reasons they were the crown jewel of wholesale acquisitions is because they had a very, very strong organic growth engine of themselves. They were consistent double-digit growers before we bought them. And generally, when we buy companies, we enhance their growth opportunities, not the opposite. So we're not expecting All Risks to be a drag at all, like... Exactly. Yes."

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call and our first call as a public company. I'd also like to thank you for your interest in and support of Ryan Specialty Group.  \n On today's call, I'll provide an overview of the strengths of our business model and our competitive advantages; and our President, Tim Turner, will give an update on what is happening at each of our 3 specialties. And finally, our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, will walk you through the quarter in more detail absent per share details since we were not yet a publicly traded company in the second quarter, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.  \n Given that we're newly public, I want to take a moment to speak to those of you who may be new to the Ryan Specialty Group story to provide some color on why I founded the company and what we built and how we provide meaningful, differentiated value to our clients and how we expect to continue to win in the future. As the name suggests, Ryan Specialty Group is a specialty insurance solutions company and generally are not involved in placing more standardized insurance like typical auto or homeowners insurance. We facilitate hard-to-place risks that require a different type of expertise in a specialized area of insurance. \n In a typical insurance transaction, the consumer will purchase insurance directly from an insurance company or will engage a retail broker that then will go direct to the insurer. But for more complex and harder to place risks, Ryan Specialty Group serves as an intermediary between the retail broker and the insurer. We facilitate the placement of these specialty risks by assisting the insurer and the broker in various ways. In 2010, it became clear to me that there was a growing and unmet need for specialty insurance solutions. The world was rapidly changing and risks were becoming much larger and far more complex. In my view, there was no scale specialty insurance platform that could assist retail brokers and carriers, and fully addressing this growing universe of complex risks can also provide a place where the best and brightest talent in our industry could self-optimize.  \n As a lifetime sports fan, I'm partial to sports metaphors. The one that has always resonated with me is the quote from the greatest hockey player of all time, Wayne Gretzky. When asked how he was such a prolific goal scorer, his response was simple: \"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is.\" That's the perfect way in my mind to describe our thought process because I always believe in anticipating change, having the courage to take the necessary action to implement that change then staying ahead of the curve with the change. This philosophy enables us to be a first mover, and I believe we're a real disruptor in our industry.  \n When we started, we observed 4 clear trends in specialty insurance, trends that continue to this day and, in many cases, are accelerating. Risks were becoming larger and more complex. It's meant that excess and surplus, or the E&S, market was poised to significantly expand over time. Also, retail brokers were looking to use fewer wholesalers than they had been doing historically, which amplified the opportunity of a full-service counterparty that have the necessary breadth and depth of specialty expertise. At the same time, retail brokers were becoming larger through organic growth and a massive wave of consolidation. This was going to fuel the growth of well-positioned wholesalers with the expertise to serve on their preferred wholesale broker panels. \n And importantly, delegated authority was accelerating quickly. Carriers were outsourcing underwriting, administrative functions and distribution. This delegated authority allows carriers to be more agile and significantly reduce their overall investment needs as well as to replace fixed costs with variable expenses. On the other hand, individual underwriters, many of whom would be dislocated by the consolidation of carriers, often were seeking to join entrepreneurial firms like Ryan Specialty, where they can be empowered to innovate. With a clear, long-term opportunity in front of us, Ryan Specialty Group was founded to fill that important need and build a platform that both empowers our producers and our underwriters to innovate as well as to take calculated risks on behalf of their clients that ultimately best position them to succeed. \n I think we've absolutely risen at the moment with regard to these opportunities. Since the founding of Ryan Specialty, we've grown rapidly both organically and inorganically, and we are now the second largest property and casualty insurance wholesale broker in the U.S. and the third largest property and casualty managing underwriter also in the U.S. I'm very proud of each and every one of our nearly 3,400 teammates who have joined us on this journey and will collectively work together to bring us to where we are today. We grew our revenue 20% organically in 2020. And we've continued our strong momentum in 2021, recording over 28% year-over-year organic revenue growth in the second quarter while generating attractive adjusted EBITDAC margins.  \n When we think about our company, the qualities that clearly set us apart from our peers are: first of all, our diverse areas of specialty; secondly, our independence. We have no channeled complex with our retail insurance focus. And most importantly, our expertise in specialty insurance. Taking a step back, we focused primarily on the rapidly growing E&S market, which was $55 billion in direct written premium at year-end 2019, and focused on complex policies, those that require specialized expertise to provide innovative solutions and procure the best available coverage option on behalf of insurers.  \n There are a number of reasons for the rise in complexity, among them climate change, recent larger catastrophic events, growing cyber threats, larger jury verdicts -- we call that social inflation, public health risks and many others. Moreover, admitted carriers are declining certain areas of coverage due to the past generation of elevated losses. As a result of that, those more complex coverages have shifted into the E&S market and the traditional market no longer provides a viable solution.  \n To that end, our independent whole service model, scaled distribution platform and expertise allow us to clearly differentiate our business relative to our peers, to take advantage of the strong and evolving secular trends. We offer our clients, insurance brokers and carriers tailored and creative solutions to address their unique and complex risk profile. With our platform, we support and collaborate with both insurance brokers and carriers, the broadest product access, underwriting knowledge and a comprehensive distribution network. This has enabled us to become a preferred and trusted partner for 97 of the top 100 retail insurance brokers in the U.S.  \n As retail brokers continue to expand and have larger needs for the assistance specialty insurance services and products, Ryan Specialty remains well positioned to provide them with a one-stop holistic solution. Critically, as I mentioned before, we have no retail-insurance-focused operations, ensuring we remain free of channel conflicts with our clients. We are firmly committed, never competing with our retail broker clients. We cannot overemphasize how important we believe this is to our business. Our success is driven by our proven ability that Ryan Specialty is destination of choice for producers and underwriters, and we believe that they will attract and retain the best talent in the industry.  \n We believe we've created a unique environment where our producers and underwriters are empowered to succeed. Innovation and empowerment are 2 of our defining attributes fundamental to our culture. We want our professionals take calculated risks where appropriate and to think like entrepreneurs and owners. We provide them with the tools and freedom to establish themselves, think outside the box and create new ways of delivering best-in-class results for our clients. They also seek multiple perspectives to enable us to find the best solutions. As a result, in 2020, we retained 97% of our producers. We believe producers join Ryan Specialty for the incredible opportunity and culture that we posted, and they stay because they are rewarded and incented to succeed in the way and aligns them with each other and the company. \n As we think about our path forward, we believe we are in a prime position to grow and prosper. We will continue to invest in our growth and ensure Ryan Specialty remains a destination of choice of industry's top-tier talent. We will continue to lead with innovation to meet the ever-changing needs of the market. We'll expand and deepen our relationships with our current clients and continue to win new clients. We will continue to expand our organic growth capabilities into the future by executing on strategic M&A. We're fond of saying that today's acquisitions are tomorrow's organic growth. Since inception, we have partnered with over 40 firms through acquisition. \n In summary, I'm tremendously proud of what we've created and developed at Ryan Specialty over the past decade. We have built a winning culture that emphasizes the successful outcomes of our expertise, our skill and our unrelenting and passionate work ethic. We believe our value proposition is clearly resonating in the market, bolstered by our talent and our trading partners in the insurance industry, without whom none of this would be possible. I'm truly excited for our future and our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.  \n Now I'd like to turn it over to our very capable President, Tim Turner, to get into more detail. Tim? \nTimothy Turner: Thank you very much, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat highlighted, at Ryan Specialty Group, we focus on partnering with our retail insurance brokers and agents to assist them with complex policies and hard-to-place risks. These complex risks are often placed in the E&S market, which represents approximately 17% of the U.S. commercial insurance market, where there is significantly more freedom to underwrite bespoke, complex, larger or higher hazard risks. Importantly, our trading partners know they will see no drop-off in quality when they work with us as we act and execute as a seamless extension of their practice group specialties. \n Notably, the flexibility of the E&S market is perfectly aligned with today's global challenges and offers Ryan Specialty a tremendous opportunity for growth. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the entire insurance industry to reconsider how it deals with contagious disease and the risk associated with it. Additionally, there is significant opportunity for us to grow our business in newer, emerging sectors, such as shared economy and livery, renewable energy, health care and cyber risks, where carriers may have less of an appetite given a myriad of legal and regulatory complexities. We have the ability to facilitate coverage in many cases that would otherwise be unattainable. \n To that end, we believe all great businesses have a clear value proposition to their key constituents, and ours is no exception. For retail brokers, we help them become more efficient and now a force multiplier for seamless execution on behalf of their clients. We also provide access to insurance markets that might not otherwise be available to them because of the insurance companies' chosen distribution model of utilizing a specialist, be it a wholesale broker, binding authority or managing general underwriter. We specialize in the small area of their business to enable them to bring the same level of excellent service for every risk that comes across their desks while maintaining the quality that their clients, the insured, are accustomed to. \n For our employees, we attract and retain the best talent in the industry, in part by giving them access to over 15,000 retail agent and brokerage firms and their large platforms across the country. This broad reach is an enormous competitive advantage. Talent thrives on having a myriad of opportunities to succeed. Our independence, scale and entrepreneurial culture ensures that we have the most opportunities to prosper. Importantly, carriers rely on us for product expertise as well as distribution and administrative capabilities. We are a source of innovation and a critical filter in the underwriting process. \n To provide a little more context, we offer retail brokers a comprehensive, full-service solution through our 3 specialties. At our Wholesale Brokerage specialty, we distribute a wide range of diversified mix of specialty insurance products and solutions from insurance carriers to retail brokerage firms, such as specialty, P&C, professional lines and workers' compensation. These typically involve the retail agents' most challenging risks. These policies are submitted on a brokerage basis and is up to the insurers to make the underwriting decision.  \n Our Binding Authority specialty provides timely and secure access to our carrier trading partners and has delegated underwriting authority as well as critical administrative and distribution responsibilities to us through our in-house binding agreements. These policies are submitted on a bound basis and are generally more uniform in design, for example, builder's risk and coastal properties.  \n Our Underwriting Management specialty offers insurance carriers variable cost, specialty expertise in distinct and complex market niches underserved in today's marketplace through 21 underwriting managers and 29 national programs. These carriers have provided us with the authority to design, underwrite and bind coverage and administer policies for specific risks. These policies are submitted on a bound basis and generally have a higher level of underwriting complexity, for example, reps and warranties, coverage for M&A, cyber coverage and renewable energy.  \n Looking ahead, we see multiple avenues for sustainable growth. We will continue to innovate and organically grow our top line, driven by broadening and deepening our retail brokerage firm relationships. It's worth highlighting that we have historically grown faster with our largest trading partners. In 2020, our growth with the top 100, the most coveted clients who have the most E&S business as ranked by Business Insurance, exceeded our organic revenue growth of 20% for the same year.  \n Talent development and recruitment is also essential. We will continue to recruit the best talent in the industry as well as onboard new professionals into the industry through our heralded RSG University, our world-class training and development program for the next generation.  \n We also plan to continue our core competency of making select acquisitions where we see clear opportunities to partner with successful specialty firms that are aligned with our goals, our culture and our values. As you know, we have acquired over 40 firms since our founding, most notably last year with All Risks, our largest acquisition to date.  \n With respect to All Risks, the integration is proceeding very smoothly. Producers at both companies are working together as one team out in the field. The acquisition of All Risks, the #4 largest wholesale distributor in the United States at the time of acquisition, gave us further scale in insurance markets where we previously had less reach, provided us a deeper and significant market segmentation, expanded our domestic footprint in a meaningful way and accelerated our vision with respect to the binding authority platform. It is rewarding to see that the combination is already yielding very positive results, and we expect it will be a major contributor to our long-term success.  \n We will also seek to expand into natural adjacencies. We recently hired an industry expert and proven leader, John Zern, who is the former CEO of Global Health Solutions and Aon. He brings to us over 30 years of health and risk strategy experience and will be developing our new employment benefit specialty, which will focus on wholesale benefits, brokerage and managing general underwriting capabilities to serve the needs of our retail brokers.  \n In addition, we see a tremendous opportunity to comprehensively address the fragmented delegated authority market, which represented over 40% of the E&S premiums in 2019 and where both M&A and panel consolidation are in their very early stages. With All Risks, we have the size and capabilities to build the first truly 50-state binding authority operation. We expect to provide updates on these initiatives and our continued progress on our specialties in the quarters ahead.  \n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on our second quarter financials. Thank you. \nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim, and hello, everyone. Let's go right into our second quarter results. So for the second quarter, we generated $390 million of total revenue, which represents a 58% increase over the $246 million in Q2 of last year. Our strong revenue growth for the quarter was attributable to both the acquisition of All Risks, which we completed in September of 2020, and organic revenue growth of 28.5%. This exceptional organic revenue growth was driven through a combination of new client wins, expanding relationships with existing clients and a higher rate of growth in our total addressable market as risks continue to flow out of the admitted market and into the E&S market, which is where we place the majority of our business. Further, multiple classes of risks realized year-over-year premium rate increases, which drives commission revenue growth, which is typically calculated as a percentage of total premium. \n At each of our 3 specialties, revenue growth was strong across the board, marked by solid organic revenue growth and contributions from the All Risks acquisition. So breaking down total revenue by specialty, our Wholesale Brokerage business posted very solid results with net commission and fee revenue of $256 million, which is a 49% increase relative to the $172 million in the same period last year. Net commission and fees at Binding Authority were also very strong as they grew 70% to $54 million compared to the $32 million in the prior period last year. Finally, Underwriting Management grew net commission and fees revenue to $80 million this quarter, which is an 89% increase compared to the $42 million in Q2 of last year. \n Moving down the P&L. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $298 million or a 58% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to compensation and benefits expense of $237 million, which is an increase of 51% from the prior year period. It's important to note that compensation and benefits expense is heavily correlated with revenue growth as many of our producers are compensated based on a percentage of the revenue that they generate for the company. We also saw an increase in both acquisition-related long-term compensation, which is primarily due to the All Risks acquisition, and noncash equity-based compensation in the second quarter as well. Now I'm proud to report that our compensation and benefits expense ratio improved 300 basis points year-over-year to 60.7%, and our adjusted compensation and benefits expense ratio improved 460 basis points to 56.5%. \n General and administrative expenses were up $9 million or 40% period-over-period. This increase was driven by cost to support revenue growth and the All Risks business flowing into the P&L as well as an uptick in travel and entertainment spending during the quarter as we saw COVID-19 restrictions begin to relax. This increase was partially offset though by a decrease in our acquisition-related expenses compared to the prior year period. Now our G&A expense ratio improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 7.9%. Our adjusted G&A expense ratio was 7.4% in Q2 this year compared to 7.1% in the same quarter last year. The increase in this ratio was primarily due to increased travel and entertainment spend as pandemic restrictions began to relax. However, given the lingering and ongoing impact of the pandemic, we still have not yet returned to our pre-COVID levels of quarterly T&E spending. \n Finally, amortization expense increased $18 million period-over-period, primarily due to the amortization of acquired intangibles from the All Risks acquisition. \n Adjusted EBITDAC for the second quarter grew 79% year-over-year to $140 million compared to $78 million in the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDAC margin increased 420 basis points to 36.0% compared to 31.8% in the prior year quarter. Now primary drivers included: one, our revenue growth driving scale in compensation and benefits expense and G&A; and two, the continued execution of the company's restructuring plan, which we initiated in 2020. When this plan is complete, we expect to achieve $25 million in cumulative annualized savings, and we anticipate that the remaining actions of this plan will be executed by June 30 of next year. \n Now regarding our adjusted EBITDAC margin. Historically, on a seasonal basis, the second and fourth quarters are the strongest in terms of margin while the first and third quarters are typically lower. Additionally, we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, including our previously mentioned wholesale employee benefit specialty as well as investments in our platform so we can continue working towards long-term growth opportunities. Further, we also expect T&E costs to normalize to pre-pandemic levels in the coming months ahead, and we now have additional material costs associated with being a public company. As such, we are looking in the medium term to maintain margins that are relatively consistent with our current annual levels. Over the long term, we do expect that our exceptional growth will yield operating leverage, but we're not quantifying that at this point. \n Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $63 million, which is a 27% increase compared to the $50 million in Q2 of last year. Net income margin was 16.3% this quarter compared to 20.3% in the prior year period. This change is due to the fact that operating income was partially offset by certain nonoperating charges taken in connection with the IPO, amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the All Risks acquisition and an increase in interest expense from the debt used to fund the All Risks acquisition. \n As we look ahead to the third quarter, we want to point out that we expect to record a significant equity-based compensation expense related to the IPO, which is, of course, onetime in nature. To provide additional visibility as well, we are providing a full year 2021 outlook for both organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows: Organic revenue growth rate for the year 2021 -- the full year 2021 is expected to be between 18% and 20%. As a reminder, All Risks will become part of the organic revenue growth calculation beginning in September of 2021. Adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year 2021 is expected to be between 30.0% and 30.5%. \n With that, we thank you very much for your time, and we'd now like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Weston Bloomer of UBS. \nWeston Bloomer: My first question is on organic growth. I believe the outlook implies around 15 -- or 13% to 17% in the second half. I was hoping you can kind of expand on how we should think about that in the 3Q versus the 4Q and maybe also expand on how you're thinking about the pricing dynamics in E&S shaping out in the second half of the year and then thoughts around new client wins as well. \nPatrick Ryan: Go ahead. \nJeremiah Bickham: Thanks for your question, Weston. We are not giving guidance by quarter. But yes, your math for H2 is roughly correct. Q2 had exceptional organic growth, and we certainly don't plan for growth numbers like this every quarter. Our forecast and the way we budget are, of course, prudent and achievable. And they don't factor in market dynamics that we're seeing right now, like the current pricing dynamic and the heavy flow into the E&S market. So we view the overall guidance for 2021 of 18% to 20% as very achievable. And if the opportunity is there, we will, of course -- you can see from this quarter and prior quarters that we're capable of exceeding that when the opportunity presents itself. Tim, did you want to add anything to the pricing dynamic part of the question? \nTimothy Turner: Sure. We don't always focus on the rates in our industry. It's more on the flow of business into the channel, the dumping and the shedding of business from the standard market. And that flow is continuing to rise. Our opportunities continue to increase in the E&S space. The percentage in non-admitted business continues to grow, very, very modest rate deceleration that we see in 1 or 2 lines but overall continued growth and rate increases. \nWeston Bloomer: That's great. Just one more on pricing. It sounds like you're expecting a slight deceleration in the second half. Is there a way to think about that as we move into 2022? And can you just talk through different avenues for pricing strength as we move through the second half of the year and into next? \nTimothy Turner: There continues to be what we refer to as niche-firming phenomenon, lines of business like cyber and health care and transportation and others that continue to firm and rates continue to increase substantially. So again, this talk about rate deceleration is very modest. We don't have a lot of data on that. Again, we measure the increase in flow and opportunities that come into our channel. That's really the governing factor for us. \nWeston Bloomer: Got it. And then if I could sneak one more in on M&A. Just curious on what you're seeing in your pipeline, if that's changed at all since you've become a public company, if that's helped more people come to the -- or more targets come to the table. And what are you seeing in terms of multiples and size of deals in your pipeline currently? \nPatrick Ryan: This is Pat. I'll answer the first part. There's been a strong flow across the board and transactional wholesale finding opportunities, program opportunities and benefits. There are lots of different reasons why people are selling. Some of them are probably tax-motivated. But there's a lot of consolidation going on in the industry. So we had to hold back, obviously, doing the IPO, but we've had discussions with people, and we're very confident that the pipeline is strong, high quality. And we're expecting to be on our planner, as we've outlined in the S-1. \nOperator: Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, starting off on the organic side. So recognizing that you don't want to give guidance by quarter but just as you think about the first half was 24% and you are expecting somewhat of a slowdown in the second half, can you just give us the components, whether it's -- do you expect perhaps a little bit less business to come to the E&S market or just a lower level of new business? I'm just trying to understand what might lead to that type of slowdown. And then if we look at the quarters of last year, the Q3 actually should represent your easiest comp. So is there just some level of conservatism embedded within this -- within your organic growth guidance? \nJeremiah Bickham: It's -- we wouldn't call it conservatism but definitely prudence. And we don't want to bake in, like I said, favorable market dynamics. You are right that in terms of comps, Q3 should -- Q3 is traditionally our smallest quarter, but the comp for Q3 is the easiest of the 4. Q4 is certainly our hardest. And I'm glad you asked because the outlook for H2 is not meant to signal anything that we're seeing in the market in terms of a reversal of flow out of the E&S or a major whipsaw on the pricing side. It's more a function of just how we forecast. \nElyse Greenspan: And have you seen -- recognizing, obviously, we're into September at this point, have you guys seen any slowdown in the third quarter to date just given that we are 2 months into the quarter? I'd just say a slowdown in terms of revenue growth. \nJeremiah Bickham: No. We are tracking to our plan. I want to stop short of giving color on the quarter or going past Q2, but we are on track for Q3. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of your margin, can you just give us a sense -- like also, right, you guys will have the public company cost. You mentioned T&E normalizing and investing internally. Can you give us a sense -- which represents the larger pieces to the kind of margin in the second half, right? Because there is going to be some deceleration in the second half from where the margin was pricing in the first half of the year. \nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. Well -- so Elyse, I think you correctly hit on all 3 buckets. So how we get from our, call it, H1 margin to the year-end guidance is those 3 things, so seasonality, T&E and public company costs. So as a reminder, Q1 and Q3 are our weakest quarters in terms of revenue, and margin is highly correlated with Q2 and Q4 being the strongest. In fact, often, Q2 is our strongest margin quarter. So even under normal circumstances, we would expect Q2 to be well above our forecasted annual margin. And this year is no exception, although it has the boost of exceptional revenue growth. \n So seasonality, number one, Q2 likely our highest margin quarter. The offset to that is Q3. It's historically well below the annual margin, with Q4 typically coming closer to our annual margin. Now additional context is COVID restrictions began to relax in Q2, but we're expecting that to continue increasing and for us to not be at a full run rate by the end of the year but perhaps by November or December be closer to pre-COVID levels of spending. So that's going to be a drag on margin as well. And then of course, we went public in July. So there were no ongoing public costs represented in the P&L through Q2. That is going to be a material impact on margins for H2. And then, of course, looking into next year, we'll have the full year not only of public cost but T&E. So keep that in mind as you're tweaking your model. \nOperator: Our next question is from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Not to rehash it too much, but is it fair to say in your outlook expectation that you're basically neutralizing any rate increases or agnostic to where rate is in those figures? \nTimothy Turner: No. We believe rates will continue to increase in most lines and specialty segments that we're in. Again, we really measure flow into the channel, the dumping and the shedding of business in the standard market, and that continues to increase measurably based on the surplus lines' stamping offices that flow through our national organization, WSIA. So we see no slowdown in that at all. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. So the variability is on slowdown basically? \nTimothy Turner: It's a stronger metric measurement for us than rate. And again, we see no slowdown in flow into our channel whatsoever. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. That's helpful. \nPatrick Ryan: But Tracy... \nTimothy Turner: Okay. Go ahead. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Go ahead. \nTimothy Turner: No, no. Go ahead. We're fine. \nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. And out of your 3 segments, how would you -- which ones would you characterize to have the largest organic revenue growth and margin potential? \nJeremiah Bickham: So we, Tracy, manage the business as a single operating segment. So we -- that's how we budget. We think of organic on a consolidated blended basis. So that's how we report. We do show revenue disaggregation by specialty in the financials. So hopefully, that's helpful. But the important thing to remember is 2 things. One, all 3 specialties are capable of double-digit organic growth. They all benefit from the fundamental building blocks of our organic growth engine that allow us to capture double-digit organic growth agnostic of pricing cycles. And the other thing is that they're all firing on all cylinders right now and all benefiting from current market conditions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. \nMeyer Shields: I'm going to take advantage of the fact that it's September also. How is the Delta variant impacting clients' assessment of exposure units? \nTimothy Turner: At this point, we saw a direct impact on small commercial and our binding authorities and -- but that's recovered now. So there really hasn't been any material or measurable impact from the Delta variant surge. It's affected some of our meetings, and our industry gatherings have slowed back down and we have some cancellations. But actually, we're more efficient. We're more productive. We're converting more opportunities. So while it's a distraction and a minor setback at the moment, we're really making the best of it working remote. And we see small commercial recovery. Small businesses are opening. There's much more construction going on even in the small area. So things are moving along uninterrupted really in the E&S channel. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. And I know we've talked about this a lot on the call. I apologize for bringing it up again. But is the implicit organic growth guidance for the second half of the year, is that assuming no rate changes, no changes in the pace of rate increases? How should we think about that? \nJeremiah Bickham: Think of it as very little impact from additional rate increases. Again, we want to separate that from what we're seeing in the market. It's -- we just don't factor into our budgets the impact of like current market dynamics. They're really hard to predict. They can change unexpectedly, but again, it's not meant to be a signal of what we're seeing in the market. As Tim said, the vital signs of the E&S market are very healthy. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's helpful. Is there any way of teasing out maybe what you think the market impact was in the first half of the year? \nUnknown Attendee: I'm sorry. Hello? \nJeremiah Bickham: Would you like to repeat that question? I'm sorry. \nMeyer Shields: Yes. So I'm sorry. I was asking when we look at the first half of the year organic growth, is there any way of saying, okay, this was the market path impact from rate increases, again obviously not budgeted in, but just to give us a sense of how much of a contributor that was in the first half of the year. \nJeremiah Bickham: So Meyer, I -- we are not going to break out the impact of rate specifically. It's hard to measure and even harder to interpret meaningfully. As Tim said, the more meaningful metric that we track is flow into the E&S market. So let's think of those as a bundle. Historically, we've been able to grow at least low double digits with no impact of heavy flow or rate increase, in fact in several years where rates were going the opposite direction. So it's not a perfect walk, but you can see the difference that current market dynamics are at least contributing to when you go from low teens to high teens or 20s. I mean the important thing to remember is -- Meyer, is that our growth, even double-digit organic growth, is not dependent on market dynamics like we're seeing now because these are not meant to last forever. But when the opportunities are there, we are market plus growers as this quarter and this whole year demonstrates. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Zaremski of Wolfe Research. \nMichael Zaremski: Maybe switching gears for a second to the M&A environment. Kind of curious, is there kind of a broad flavor of size of transactions we should -- you guys are looking at? Is it kind of mostly like smaller tuck-ins? Or is it going to be a mix of kind of larger transactions and tuck-ins? Any color would be helpful. \nPatrick Ryan: Well, Mike, we always look at acquisitions to improve our offering to our clients. Parallel to that, we look at acquisitions that are beneficial to our shareholders. And so it can be tuck-in and have generally been tuck-ins. But I would tell you that because you ask the current status, there's more activity in larger tuck-in but different specialty lines of expertise that can be managing underwriting -- often are managing underwriting. There's robust interest in delegated authority growth. And so buyers are out there, and that's attracted sellers. And so right now, I would say that the average deal that we're being exposed to is larger than the norm. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful, Pat. Maybe moving back to organic growth. And I'm just going to focus on this quarter. I'm not trying to focus on the forward-looking like a lot of the previous questions. But is there any flavor or context around some of the acceleration in growth that we should be thinking about? Perhaps maybe there were some larger, chunkier account placements that kind of came through. Anything kind of more might be kind of not one-off but just a more near-term trend? Or is it just really what you guys have been saying just everything -- all the segments are hitting on all cylinders? \nTimothy Turner: It's more of the latter. It's a real, measurable increase in flow into the channel, and we're capturing a large share of that. So it's -- again, it's very difficult to pull out rate on new versus renewal. It's much more accurate for us to look at the percentage of non-admitted business overall and how much of that flows into our world and how much we can capture. So it's all very specialized by discipline. But as an example, construction is picking up again. We read about it every day. So infrastructure projects, residential construction, all of that is starting to really pick up and boom, and that's one of our top specialties. So -- and lots of other segments that we can see this increase in flow. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Got it. And maybe I'll sneak one last one in. Is there going to be a potential difference between the cash tax rate and the GAAP tax rate going forward and I guess for -- thinking about the Class A shareholders. \nJeremiah Bickham: So Mike, the best way -- the best guidance I can give you -- I won't go through the details of how an -- how taxes at an LLC show up or don't show up on the P&L versus a C-corp because I know you understand that. The most comparable view of taxes for us is going to be in our adjusted net income walk, where we show what's called adjusted tax expense. And that basically assumes that the C-corp owns all of Ryan Specialty Group LLC. And so you see consistent tax rate for the entire company when in reality, right now, the pubco, the C-corp only owns 42%, 43% of the LLC. \n So as that changes over time and in thinking about us relative to other C-corps, I think that adjusted income tax expense, which is basically a pro forma 25%, is the best calculation to use for your model because in reality, the cash taxes that the C-corp -- that the pubco holding company C-corp pays to the government will be one piece of it. The cash taxes paid directly to the government on behalf of the C-corps that the LLC owns are going to be a small piece, and then there's tax distributions that go to all holders of the LLC, including the pubco C-corp. So the simplest, most comparable, fair view is that adjusted income tax expense in the adjusted net income walk. \nOperator: There are no more questions at this time. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Pat Ryan for closing remarks. \nPatrick Ryan: Thank you, operator, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. In closing, I'd like to thank our entire team here at Ryan Specialty for their tremendous work and dedication to get us to this point and for always delivering the highest quality service to our clients. I really believe that our exceptional talent has us in a position to continue delivering well into the future. Thanks, everyone, for joining our inaugural quarterly earnings call, and we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thanks very much. Have a good evening. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Jeremiah Bickham",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim, and hello, everyone. Let's go right into our second quarter results. So for the second quarter, we generated $390 million of total revenue, which represents a 58% increase over the $246 million in Q2 of last year. Our strong revenue growth for the quarter was attributable to both the acquisition of All Risks, which we completed in September of 2020, and organic revenue growth of 28.5%. This exceptional organic revenue growth was driven through a combination of new client wins, expanding relationships with existing clients and a higher rate of growth in our total addressable market as risks continue to flow out of the admitted market and into the E&S market, which is where we place the majority of our business. Further, multiple classes of risks realized year-over-year premium rate increases, which drives commission revenue growth, which is typically calculated as a percentage of total premium. \n At each of our 3 specialties, revenue growth was strong across the board, marked by solid organic revenue growth and contributions from the All Risks acquisition. So breaking down total revenue by specialty, our Wholesale Brokerage business posted very solid results with net commission and fee revenue of $256 million, which is a 49% increase relative to the $172 million in the same period last year. Net commission and fees at Binding Authority were also very strong as they grew 70% to $54 million compared to the $32 million in the prior period last year. Finally, Underwriting Management grew net commission and fees revenue to $80 million this quarter, which is an 89% increase compared to the $42 million in Q2 of last year. \n Moving down the P&L. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $298 million or a 58% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This was primarily due to compensation and benefits expense of $237 million, which is an increase of 51% from the prior year period. It's important to note that compensation and benefits expense is heavily correlated with revenue growth as many of our producers are compensated based on a percentage of the revenue that they generate for the company. We also saw an increase in both acquisition-related long-term compensation, which is primarily due to the All Risks acquisition, and noncash equity-based compensation in the second quarter as well. Now I'm proud to report that our compensation and benefits expense ratio improved 300 basis points year-over-year to 60.7%, and our adjusted compensation and benefits expense ratio improved 460 basis points to 56.5%. \n General and administrative expenses were up $9 million or 40% period-over-period. This increase was driven by cost to support revenue growth and the All Risks business flowing into the P&L as well as an uptick in travel and entertainment spending during the quarter as we saw COVID-19 restrictions begin to relax. This increase was partially offset though by a decrease in our acquisition-related expenses compared to the prior year period. Now our G&A expense ratio improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 7.9%. Our adjusted G&A expense ratio was 7.4% in Q2 this year compared to 7.1% in the same quarter last year. The increase in this ratio was primarily due to increased travel and entertainment spend as pandemic restrictions began to relax. However, given the lingering and ongoing impact of the pandemic, we still have not yet returned to our pre-COVID levels of quarterly T&E spending. \n Finally, amortization expense increased $18 million period-over-period, primarily due to the amortization of acquired intangibles from the All Risks acquisition. \n Adjusted EBITDAC for the second quarter grew 79% year-over-year to $140 million compared to $78 million in the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDAC margin increased 420 basis points to 36.0% compared to 31.8% in the prior year quarter. Now primary drivers included: one, our revenue growth driving scale in compensation and benefits expense and G&A; and two, the continued execution of the company's restructuring plan, which we initiated in 2020. When this plan is complete, we expect to achieve $25 million in cumulative annualized savings, and we anticipate that the remaining actions of this plan will be executed by June 30 of next year. \n Now regarding our adjusted EBITDAC margin. Historically, on a seasonal basis, the second and fourth quarters are the strongest in terms of margin while the first and third quarters are typically lower. Additionally, we continue to invest in the long-term growth of our business, including our previously mentioned wholesale employee benefit specialty as well as investments in our platform so we can continue working towards long-term growth opportunities. Further, we also expect T&E costs to normalize to pre-pandemic levels in the coming months ahead, and we now have additional material costs associated with being a public company. As such, we are looking in the medium term to maintain margins that are relatively consistent with our current annual levels. Over the long term, we do expect that our exceptional growth will yield operating leverage, but we're not quantifying that at this point. \n Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $63 million, which is a 27% increase compared to the $50 million in Q2 of last year. Net income margin was 16.3% this quarter compared to 20.3% in the prior year period. This change is due to the fact that operating income was partially offset by certain nonoperating charges taken in connection with the IPO, amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the All Risks acquisition and an increase in interest expense from the debt used to fund the All Risks acquisition. \n As we look ahead to the third quarter, we want to point out that we expect to record a significant equity-based compensation expense related to the IPO, which is, of course, onetime in nature. To provide additional visibility as well, we are providing a full year 2021 outlook for both organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows: Organic revenue growth rate for the year 2021 -- the full year 2021 is expected to be between 18% and 20%. As a reminder, All Risks will become part of the organic revenue growth calculation beginning in September of 2021. Adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year 2021 is expected to be between 30.0% and 30.5%. \n With that, we thank you very much for your time, and we'd now like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Thanks for your question, Weston. We are not giving guidance by quarter. But yes, your math for H2 is roughly correct. Q2 had exceptional organic growth, and we certainly don't plan for growth numbers like this every quarter. Our forecast and the way we budget are, of course, prudent and achievable. And they don't factor in market dynamics that we're seeing right now, like the current pricing dynamic and the heavy flow into the E&S market. So we view the overall guidance for 2021 of 18% to 20% as very achievable. And if the opportunity is there, we will, of course -- you can see from this quarter and prior quarters that we're capable of exceeding that when the opportunity presents itself. Tim, did you want to add anything to the pricing dynamic part of the question? It's -- we wouldn't call it conservatism but definitely prudence. And we don't want to bake in, like I said, favorable market dynamics. You are right that in terms of comps, Q3 should -- Q3 is traditionally our smallest quarter, but the comp for Q3 is the easiest of the 4. Q4 is certainly our hardest. And I'm glad you asked because the outlook for H2 is not meant to signal anything that we're seeing in the market in terms of a reversal of flow out of the E&S or a major whipsaw on the pricing side. It's more a function of just how we forecast. No. We are tracking to our plan. I want to stop short of giving color on the quarter or going past Q2, but we are on track for Q3. Yes. Well -- so Elyse, I think you correctly hit on all 3 buckets. So how we get from our, call it, H1 margin to the year-end guidance is those 3 things, so seasonality, T&E and public company costs. So as a reminder, Q1 and Q3 are our weakest quarters in terms of revenue, and margin is highly correlated with Q2 and Q4 being the strongest. In fact, often, Q2 is our strongest margin quarter. So even under normal circumstances, we would expect Q2 to be well above our forecasted annual margin. And this year is no exception, although it has the boost of exceptional revenue growth. \n So seasonality, number one, Q2 likely our highest margin quarter. The offset to that is Q3. It's historically well below the annual margin, with Q4 typically coming closer to our annual margin. Now additional context is COVID restrictions began to relax in Q2, but we're expecting that to continue increasing and for us to not be at a full run rate by the end of the year but perhaps by November or December be closer to pre-COVID levels of spending. So that's going to be a drag on margin as well. And then of course, we went public in July. So there were no ongoing public costs represented in the P&L through Q2. That is going to be a material impact on margins for H2. And then, of course, looking into next year, we'll have the full year not only of public cost but T&E. So keep that in mind as you're tweaking your model. So we, Tracy, manage the business as a single operating segment. So we -- that's how we budget. We think of organic on a consolidated blended basis. So that's how we report. We do show revenue disaggregation by specialty in the financials. So hopefully, that's helpful. But the important thing to remember is 2 things. One, all 3 specialties are capable of double-digit organic growth. They all benefit from the fundamental building blocks of our organic growth engine that allow us to capture double-digit organic growth agnostic of pricing cycles. And the other thing is that they're all firing on all cylinders right now and all benefiting from current market conditions. Think of it as very little impact from additional rate increases. Again, we want to separate that from what we're seeing in the market. It's -- we just don't factor into our budgets the impact of like current market dynamics. They're really hard to predict. They can change unexpectedly, but again, it's not meant to be a signal of what we're seeing in the market. As Tim said, the vital signs of the E&S market are very healthy. Would you like to repeat that question? I'm sorry. So Meyer, I -- we are not going to break out the impact of rate specifically. It's hard to measure and even harder to interpret meaningfully. As Tim said, the more meaningful metric that we track is flow into the E&S market. So let's think of those as a bundle. Historically, we've been able to grow at least low double digits with no impact of heavy flow or rate increase, in fact in several years where rates were going the opposite direction. So it's not a perfect walk, but you can see the difference that current market dynamics are at least contributing to when you go from low teens to high teens or 20s. I mean the important thing to remember is -- Meyer, is that our growth, even double-digit organic growth, is not dependent on market dynamics like we're seeing now because these are not meant to last forever. But when the opportunities are there, we are market plus growers as this quarter and this whole year demonstrates. So Mike, the best way -- the best guidance I can give you -- I won't go through the details of how an -- how taxes at an LLC show up or don't show up on the P&L versus a C-corp because I know you understand that. The most comparable view of taxes for us is going to be in our adjusted net income walk, where we show what's called adjusted tax expense. And that basically assumes that the C-corp owns all of Ryan Specialty Group LLC. And so you see consistent tax rate for the entire company when in reality, right now, the pubco, the C-corp only owns 42%, 43% of the LLC. \n So as that changes over time and in thinking about us relative to other C-corps, I think that adjusted income tax expense, which is basically a pro forma 25%, is the best calculation to use for your model because in reality, the cash taxes that the C-corp -- that the pubco holding company C-corp pays to the government will be one piece of it. The cash taxes paid directly to the government on behalf of the C-corps that the LLC owns are going to be a small piece, and then there's tax distributions that go to all holders of the LLC, including the pubco C-corp. So the simplest, most comparable, fair view is that adjusted income tax expense in the adjusted net income walk."

            "name": "Patrick Ryan",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call and our first call as a public company. I'd also like to thank you for your interest in and support of Ryan Specialty Group.  \n On today's call, I'll provide an overview of the strengths of our business model and our competitive advantages; and our President, Tim Turner, will give an update on what is happening at each of our 3 specialties. And finally, our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, will walk you through the quarter in more detail absent per share details since we were not yet a publicly traded company in the second quarter, and then we'll open it up for Q&A.  \n Given that we're newly public, I want to take a moment to speak to those of you who may be new to the Ryan Specialty Group story to provide some color on why I founded the company and what we built and how we provide meaningful, differentiated value to our clients and how we expect to continue to win in the future. As the name suggests, Ryan Specialty Group is a specialty insurance solutions company and generally are not involved in placing more standardized insurance like typical auto or homeowners insurance. We facilitate hard-to-place risks that require a different type of expertise in a specialized area of insurance. \n In a typical insurance transaction, the consumer will purchase insurance directly from an insurance company or will engage a retail broker that then will go direct to the insurer. But for more complex and harder to place risks, Ryan Specialty Group serves as an intermediary between the retail broker and the insurer. We facilitate the placement of these specialty risks by assisting the insurer and the broker in various ways. In 2010, it became clear to me that there was a growing and unmet need for specialty insurance solutions. The world was rapidly changing and risks were becoming much larger and far more complex. In my view, there was no scale specialty insurance platform that could assist retail brokers and carriers, and fully addressing this growing universe of complex risks can also provide a place where the best and brightest talent in our industry could self-optimize.  \n As a lifetime sports fan, I'm partial to sports metaphors. The one that has always resonated with me is the quote from the greatest hockey player of all time, Wayne Gretzky. When asked how he was such a prolific goal scorer, his response was simple: \"I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it is.\" That's the perfect way in my mind to describe our thought process because I always believe in anticipating change, having the courage to take the necessary action to implement that change then staying ahead of the curve with the change. This philosophy enables us to be a first mover, and I believe we're a real disruptor in our industry.  \n When we started, we observed 4 clear trends in specialty insurance, trends that continue to this day and, in many cases, are accelerating. Risks were becoming larger and more complex. It's meant that excess and surplus, or the E&S, market was poised to significantly expand over time. Also, retail brokers were looking to use fewer wholesalers than they had been doing historically, which amplified the opportunity of a full-service counterparty that have the necessary breadth and depth of specialty expertise. At the same time, retail brokers were becoming larger through organic growth and a massive wave of consolidation. This was going to fuel the growth of well-positioned wholesalers with the expertise to serve on their preferred wholesale broker panels. \n And importantly, delegated authority was accelerating quickly. Carriers were outsourcing underwriting, administrative functions and distribution. This delegated authority allows carriers to be more agile and significantly reduce their overall investment needs as well as to replace fixed costs with variable expenses. On the other hand, individual underwriters, many of whom would be dislocated by the consolidation of carriers, often were seeking to join entrepreneurial firms like Ryan Specialty, where they can be empowered to innovate. With a clear, long-term opportunity in front of us, Ryan Specialty Group was founded to fill that important need and build a platform that both empowers our producers and our underwriters to innovate as well as to take calculated risks on behalf of their clients that ultimately best position them to succeed. \n I think we've absolutely risen at the moment with regard to these opportunities. Since the founding of Ryan Specialty, we've grown rapidly both organically and inorganically, and we are now the second largest property and casualty insurance wholesale broker in the U.S. and the third largest property and casualty managing underwriter also in the U.S. I'm very proud of each and every one of our nearly 3,400 teammates who have joined us on this journey and will collectively work together to bring us to where we are today. We grew our revenue 20% organically in 2020. And we've continued our strong momentum in 2021, recording over 28% year-over-year organic revenue growth in the second quarter while generating attractive adjusted EBITDAC margins.  \n When we think about our company, the qualities that clearly set us apart from our peers are: first of all, our diverse areas of specialty; secondly, our independence. We have no channeled complex with our retail insurance focus. And most importantly, our expertise in specialty insurance. Taking a step back, we focused primarily on the rapidly growing E&S market, which was $55 billion in direct written premium at year-end 2019, and focused on complex policies, those that require specialized expertise to provide innovative solutions and procure the best available coverage option on behalf of insurers.  \n There are a number of reasons for the rise in complexity, among them climate change, recent larger catastrophic events, growing cyber threats, larger jury verdicts -- we call that social inflation, public health risks and many others. Moreover, admitted carriers are declining certain areas of coverage due to the past generation of elevated losses. As a result of that, those more complex coverages have shifted into the E&S market and the traditional market no longer provides a viable solution.  \n To that end, our independent whole service model, scaled distribution platform and expertise allow us to clearly differentiate our business relative to our peers, to take advantage of the strong and evolving secular trends. We offer our clients, insurance brokers and carriers tailored and creative solutions to address their unique and complex risk profile. With our platform, we support and collaborate with both insurance brokers and carriers, the broadest product access, underwriting knowledge and a comprehensive distribution network. This has enabled us to become a preferred and trusted partner for 97 of the top 100 retail insurance brokers in the U.S.  \n As retail brokers continue to expand and have larger needs for the assistance specialty insurance services and products, Ryan Specialty remains well positioned to provide them with a one-stop holistic solution. Critically, as I mentioned before, we have no retail-insurance-focused operations, ensuring we remain free of channel conflicts with our clients. We are firmly committed, never competing with our retail broker clients. We cannot overemphasize how important we believe this is to our business. Our success is driven by our proven ability that Ryan Specialty is destination of choice for producers and underwriters, and we believe that they will attract and retain the best talent in the industry.  \n We believe we've created a unique environment where our producers and underwriters are empowered to succeed. Innovation and empowerment are 2 of our defining attributes fundamental to our culture. We want our professionals take calculated risks where appropriate and to think like entrepreneurs and owners. We provide them with the tools and freedom to establish themselves, think outside the box and create new ways of delivering best-in-class results for our clients. They also seek multiple perspectives to enable us to find the best solutions. As a result, in 2020, we retained 97% of our producers. We believe producers join Ryan Specialty for the incredible opportunity and culture that we posted, and they stay because they are rewarded and incented to succeed in the way and aligns them with each other and the company. \n As we think about our path forward, we believe we are in a prime position to grow and prosper. We will continue to invest in our growth and ensure Ryan Specialty remains a destination of choice of industry's top-tier talent. We will continue to lead with innovation to meet the ever-changing needs of the market. We'll expand and deepen our relationships with our current clients and continue to win new clients. We will continue to expand our organic growth capabilities into the future by executing on strategic M&A. We're fond of saying that today's acquisitions are tomorrow's organic growth. Since inception, we have partnered with over 40 firms through acquisition. \n In summary, I'm tremendously proud of what we've created and developed at Ryan Specialty over the past decade. We have built a winning culture that emphasizes the successful outcomes of our expertise, our skill and our unrelenting and passionate work ethic. We believe our value proposition is clearly resonating in the market, bolstered by our talent and our trading partners in the insurance industry, without whom none of this would be possible. I'm truly excited for our future and our ability to continue to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.  \n Now I'd like to turn it over to our very capable President, Tim Turner, to get into more detail. Tim? Go ahead. This is Pat. I'll answer the first part. There's been a strong flow across the board and transactional wholesale finding opportunities, program opportunities and benefits. There are lots of different reasons why people are selling. Some of them are probably tax-motivated. But there's a lot of consolidation going on in the industry. So we had to hold back, obviously, doing the IPO, but we've had discussions with people, and we're very confident that the pipeline is strong, high quality. And we're expecting to be on our planner, as we've outlined in the S-1. But Tracy... Well, Mike, we always look at acquisitions to improve our offering to our clients. Parallel to that, we look at acquisitions that are beneficial to our shareholders. And so it can be tuck-in and have generally been tuck-ins. But I would tell you that because you ask the current status, there's more activity in larger tuck-in but different specialty lines of expertise that can be managing underwriting -- often are managing underwriting. There's robust interest in delegated authority growth. And so buyers are out there, and that's attracted sellers. And so right now, I would say that the average deal that we're being exposed to is larger than the norm. Thank you, operator, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. In closing, I'd like to thank our entire team here at Ryan Specialty for their tremendous work and dedication to get us to this point and for always delivering the highest quality service to our clients. I really believe that our exceptional talent has us in a position to continue delivering well into the future. Thanks, everyone, for joining our inaugural quarterly earnings call, and we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thanks very much. Have a good evening."

            "name": "Timothy Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. As Pat highlighted, at Ryan Specialty Group, we focus on partnering with our retail insurance brokers and agents to assist them with complex policies and hard-to-place risks. These complex risks are often placed in the E&S market, which represents approximately 17% of the U.S. commercial insurance market, where there is significantly more freedom to underwrite bespoke, complex, larger or higher hazard risks. Importantly, our trading partners know they will see no drop-off in quality when they work with us as we act and execute as a seamless extension of their practice group specialties. \n Notably, the flexibility of the E&S market is perfectly aligned with today's global challenges and offers Ryan Specialty a tremendous opportunity for growth. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the entire insurance industry to reconsider how it deals with contagious disease and the risk associated with it. Additionally, there is significant opportunity for us to grow our business in newer, emerging sectors, such as shared economy and livery, renewable energy, health care and cyber risks, where carriers may have less of an appetite given a myriad of legal and regulatory complexities. We have the ability to facilitate coverage in many cases that would otherwise be unattainable. \n To that end, we believe all great businesses have a clear value proposition to their key constituents, and ours is no exception. For retail brokers, we help them become more efficient and now a force multiplier for seamless execution on behalf of their clients. We also provide access to insurance markets that might not otherwise be available to them because of the insurance companies' chosen distribution model of utilizing a specialist, be it a wholesale broker, binding authority or managing general underwriter. We specialize in the small area of their business to enable them to bring the same level of excellent service for every risk that comes across their desks while maintaining the quality that their clients, the insured, are accustomed to. \n For our employees, we attract and retain the best talent in the industry, in part by giving them access to over 15,000 retail agent and brokerage firms and their large platforms across the country. This broad reach is an enormous competitive advantage. Talent thrives on having a myriad of opportunities to succeed. Our independence, scale and entrepreneurial culture ensures that we have the most opportunities to prosper. Importantly, carriers rely on us for product expertise as well as distribution and administrative capabilities. We are a source of innovation and a critical filter in the underwriting process. \n To provide a little more context, we offer retail brokers a comprehensive, full-service solution through our 3 specialties. At our Wholesale Brokerage specialty, we distribute a wide range of diversified mix of specialty insurance products and solutions from insurance carriers to retail brokerage firms, such as specialty, P&C, professional lines and workers' compensation. These typically involve the retail agents' most challenging risks. These policies are submitted on a brokerage basis and is up to the insurers to make the underwriting decision.  \n Our Binding Authority specialty provides timely and secure access to our carrier trading partners and has delegated underwriting authority as well as critical administrative and distribution responsibilities to us through our in-house binding agreements. These policies are submitted on a bound basis and are generally more uniform in design, for example, builder's risk and coastal properties.  \n Our Underwriting Management specialty offers insurance carriers variable cost, specialty expertise in distinct and complex market niches underserved in today's marketplace through 21 underwriting managers and 29 national programs. These carriers have provided us with the authority to design, underwrite and bind coverage and administer policies for specific risks. These policies are submitted on a bound basis and generally have a higher level of underwriting complexity, for example, reps and warranties, coverage for M&A, cyber coverage and renewable energy.  \n Looking ahead, we see multiple avenues for sustainable growth. We will continue to innovate and organically grow our top line, driven by broadening and deepening our retail brokerage firm relationships. It's worth highlighting that we have historically grown faster with our largest trading partners. In 2020, our growth with the top 100, the most coveted clients who have the most E&S business as ranked by Business Insurance, exceeded our organic revenue growth of 20% for the same year.  \n Talent development and recruitment is also essential. We will continue to recruit the best talent in the industry as well as onboard new professionals into the industry through our heralded RSG University, our world-class training and development program for the next generation.  \n We also plan to continue our core competency of making select acquisitions where we see clear opportunities to partner with successful specialty firms that are aligned with our goals, our culture and our values. As you know, we have acquired over 40 firms since our founding, most notably last year with All Risks, our largest acquisition to date.  \n With respect to All Risks, the integration is proceeding very smoothly. Producers at both companies are working together as one team out in the field. The acquisition of All Risks, the #4 largest wholesale distributor in the United States at the time of acquisition, gave us further scale in insurance markets where we previously had less reach, provided us a deeper and significant market segmentation, expanded our domestic footprint in a meaningful way and accelerated our vision with respect to the binding authority platform. It is rewarding to see that the combination is already yielding very positive results, and we expect it will be a major contributor to our long-term success.  \n We will also seek to expand into natural adjacencies. We recently hired an industry expert and proven leader, John Zern, who is the former CEO of Global Health Solutions and Aon. He brings to us over 30 years of health and risk strategy experience and will be developing our new employment benefit specialty, which will focus on wholesale benefits, brokerage and managing general underwriting capabilities to serve the needs of our retail brokers.  \n In addition, we see a tremendous opportunity to comprehensively address the fragmented delegated authority market, which represented over 40% of the E&S premiums in 2019 and where both M&A and panel consolidation are in their very early stages. With All Risks, we have the size and capabilities to build the first truly 50-state binding authority operation. We expect to provide updates on these initiatives and our continued progress on our specialties in the quarters ahead.  \n With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on our second quarter financials. Thank you. Sure. We don't always focus on the rates in our industry. It's more on the flow of business into the channel, the dumping and the shedding of business from the standard market. And that flow is continuing to rise. Our opportunities continue to increase in the E&S space. The percentage in non-admitted business continues to grow, very, very modest rate deceleration that we see in 1 or 2 lines but overall continued growth and rate increases. There continues to be what we refer to as niche-firming phenomenon, lines of business like cyber and health care and transportation and others that continue to firm and rates continue to increase substantially. So again, this talk about rate deceleration is very modest. We don't have a lot of data on that. Again, we measure the increase in flow and opportunities that come into our channel. That's really the governing factor for us. No. We believe rates will continue to increase in most lines and specialty segments that we're in. Again, we really measure flow into the channel, the dumping and the shedding of business in the standard market, and that continues to increase measurably based on the surplus lines' stamping offices that flow through our national organization, WSIA. So we see no slowdown in that at all. It's a stronger metric measurement for us than rate. And again, we see no slowdown in flow into our channel whatsoever. Okay. Go ahead. No, no. Go ahead. We're fine. At this point, we saw a direct impact on small commercial and our binding authorities and -- but that's recovered now. So there really hasn't been any material or measurable impact from the Delta variant surge. It's affected some of our meetings, and our industry gatherings have slowed back down and we have some cancellations. But actually, we're more efficient. We're more productive. We're converting more opportunities. So while it's a distraction and a minor setback at the moment, we're really making the best of it working remote. And we see small commercial recovery. Small businesses are opening. There's much more construction going on even in the small area. So things are moving along uninterrupted really in the E&S channel. It's more of the latter. It's a real, measurable increase in flow into the channel, and we're capturing a large share of that. So it's -- again, it's very difficult to pull out rate on new versus renewal. It's much more accurate for us to look at the percentage of non-admitted business overall and how much of that flows into our world and how much we can capture. So it's all very specialized by discipline. But as an example, construction is picking up again. We read about it every day. So infrastructure projects, residential construction, all of that is starting to really pick up and boom, and that's one of our top specialties. So -- and lots of other segments that we can see this increase in flow."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Noah Angeletti, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer.

Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results. Joining us on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; and our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller. Before we discuss Ryan's Specialty's 2022 performance, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the passing of Andrew J. McKenna. Andy was an invaluable member of our Board since its inception in 2012, serving on the Compensation and Governance Committee and as our Lead Director. Andy was a national voice on the topic of corporate governance, Chicago institution, business icon, humanitarian, philanthropist, husband, father, brother and the dear friend. He will be missed by all who knew him. 2022 was an outstanding year for Ryan Specialty. The tireless efforts and dedication of our brokers, underwriters and the entire Ryan Specialty team is evident in our results. For the full year, we generated record revenue of over $1.7 billion, driven by organic growth of 16.4% on top of 22.4% in 2021, and produced a strong adjusted EBITDAC margin of 30%. I want to take a few minutes to highlight some noteworthy achievements in 2022, which were significant for our firm. We invested in an exceptional talent while onboarding the largest production class in our history. We enhanced our capabilities through new product offerings and integrated our 2021 acquisitions of Keystone and Crouse, both of which exceeded their growth goals for the first year as a part of the Ryan Specialty team. We were pleased to announce a highly strategic acquisition, Griffin Underwriting Services, which closed on January 3 of this year. With approximately $23 million in revenue, Griffin deepens our offerings in the Pacific Northwest, broadening our geographic scope and our capabilities and binding authority and brokerage specialties. Importantly, Griffin's consistent underwriting results, deep bench of talent and focus on training and development is a clear cultural match with Ryan Specialty. Further enhancing Ryan Specialty's a central role as a trading partner to our retailers. Continuing our winning culture, I'm pleased to report another year of 97% retention of our producers, consistent with 2021. For the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 14.9%, led by 10.3% organic growth. We also grew our adjusted EBITDAC and generated another quarter of solid adjusted net income. In the fourth quarter, the specific headwinds, we noted on our prior call, were in line with our expectations. We anticipate that these headwinds will persist into at least the first half of 2023. That said, we were very pleased to see the strength in property manifest itself late in Q4, which drove the modest outperformance versus our expectations for the quarter. As we progress through 2023, there are three things we believe you can expect from Ryan Specialty. First, we see continued solid growth in the business. Although there is heightened macro uncertainty, the complexity of risk continues to increase. And as a result, we believe the E&S market will continue to be a standout within the insurance industry. We expect our growth will be balanced across our diverse portfolio of products and solutions, enabling us to capture the broader E&S tailwinds while capitalizing on specific areas of accelerated growth. We expect to grow our business through M&A. Our pipeline remains robust, both in tuck-ins and some larger platform opportunities. We continue to focus on M&A opportunities with the highest quality specialty distributors including wholesale, delegated authority and benefits. We will also look to grow our business through our alternative risk strategy, arranging alternative capital to support our clients, expanding our addressable market and building on our culture of innovation. Second, we will continue to invest in our business. We expect another year of targeted hiring, adding industry top talent in both underwriting and broking or the needed most as well as continuing to build our internship program at Ryan Specialty University. We will also make additional investment in our delegated authority specialties, including the systems and technology to further enhance our actuarial risk management and loss control teams. And third, we will execute on strategic initiatives to increase the scalability of our operating platform. Today, we are announcing the launch of Accelerate 2025, a two-year restructuring program effective in Q1. Through this program, we're making changes and investments that will enable continued growth, drive innovation and deliver sustainable productivity improvements over the long term. Accelerate 2025 is a natural progression of our strategy that brings together our people and assets in a way that allows us to continue to rapidly innovate and more efficiently provide new and improved solutions to the most complex challenges that our clients face. Jeremiah will provide more details in his remarks, but we anticipate a cumulative special charge of approximately $65 million through 2024. We expect the program will deliver approximately $35 million of annual savings in 2025 and further enhance our ability to scale our platform in the years beyond. Accelerate 2025 is designed in concert with our growth strategy, and we will continue to make investment decisions including hiring and M&A based on a disciplined return on capital basis, both now and in the future. Looking forward, I'm confident that 2023 will be another strong year for our firm. We expect sustained growth and have a flexible business model that allows us to quickly adapt and pivot to changing market conditions. As we've noted previously, risks across industries are only becoming more complex, and the E&S market has continued to outpace the overall P&C insurance market. Our products are larger compulsory and our clients and trading partners value the unparalleled expertise we bring as we anticipate our needs and work tirelessly to provide the right solutions for our insurers. This, along with our other secular growth drivers, should allow us to continue generating double-digit organic growth over the long term. In summary, I'm very proud of our entire team for delivering outstanding results for our clients, trading partners and shareholders in a challenging insurance market and macro environment. Through innovation and exceptional customer service, we have once again validated our differentiated business model and continue to be a trusted partner to substantially all of the top 100 retailers. Now, I'll turn it over to Tim. Tim?\nTim Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. It was another solid quarter and year across our specialties. These results are a testament to the teamwork across the firm, from our producers to our underwriters and their teams. As Pat noted, the E&S market continued to grow in importance to the insurance industry, and we capitalized on these industry trends. Diving into our specialties. Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty achieved another quarter of solid growth spread across many lines of business. Property continues to experience a historically hard market as rates rose significantly and capacity tightened. We are seeing a large volume of new business flow into the non-admitted market, and we remain very encouraged by Property's potential looking ahead. As we've noted previously, major events such as Hurricane Ian, winter storms and other climate events as well as a tougher reinsurance renewal process have led to less capacity as well as even higher rates. This is producing increasing demand for insurance solutions and a recurring opportunity for our experience and expertise to fill that need. Cyber performed well in the fourth quarter and for the year. While we continue to see a moderation in rate increases, we believe there is ample runway for us to pursue regardless of short-term pricing trends. Our technical expertise in areas like cyber is playing a significant role in our ability to build large towers of capacity for our clients. Our transportation practice, particularly in trucking, continues to see substantial flow fueled by social inflation, and ensure a need for continued rate increases. We continue to win new business and remain well positioned for 2023 to capitalize on additional growth opportunities. In our Binding Authority specialty, we saw another quarter of solid growth in traditional binding, which includes small commercial business that has historically been economically sensitive. This growth was partially offset by our personal lines Binding Authority, which was still experiencing capacity constraints prior to renewals. We continue to see the potential for panel consolidation as a long and steady growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to execute. Our underwriting management specialty posted another strong quarter led by property and casualty, healthcare and our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re, despite headwinds in our transactional liability lines, driven by lower M&A volume. As Pat noted, in the fourth quarter, the specific headwinds in certain lines we raised on our prior call are rapid rate decline in public company D&O, lower external M&A and IPO volumes and transactional liability and delayed project-based starts in construction were in line with our expectations. We anticipate that these headwinds will persist into at least the first half of 2023. We remain confident that we have the right teams in place to grow these lines over the long term. In terms of the E&S market, our observation is that pricing has remained firm in January and into February in most classes of business with public company D&O being the ongoing exception. In addition, the standard market carrier competition we observed on the periphery and which we flagged on prior earning calls, has yet to meaningfully impact rate or flow in the aggregate. As we've said previously, we expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our fourth quarter. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q4, we grew total revenue 14.9% period-over-period to $435 million, fueled by another solid quarter of organic revenue growth at 10.3%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market and continuing to win a substantial amount of new business. We were pleased to see the strength in property late in Q4, specifically in the last two weeks of December, which drove the modest outperformance versus our expectations for the quarter. Net income for Q4 '22 was $46 million or $0.14 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO-related and other unusual items, was $74 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the fourth quarter grew 6% period-over-period, to $127 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 250 basis points to 29.3%. Our adjusted EBITDAC margin was impacted by continued investments in the business and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels, which was partially offset by higher fiduciary investment income. As Pat noted, in 2023, we expect to continue bringing aboard top underwriting and broking talent wherever we see clear opportunities to grow lines of business. We also expect to recruit a significant class of new talent at Ryan Specialty in the months ahead. In addition, as we noted in our release earlier today and in Pat's earlier remarks, we are embarking on our Accelerate 2025 program, which will strengthen how Ryan Specialty operates and further improves our efficiency and unlocks additional value for our clients and shareholders. Over the last four years alone, our revenue has more than doubled, head count is up 50%, and all while the U.S. E&S market has grown by over 80%. We believe this is the right time to continue building on our success and have thoughtfully designed a program that will prepare Ryan Specialty for the next cycle of growth. Accelerate 2025 will result in approximately $65 million of cumulative charges through 2024. In turn, we expect it to generate annual savings of approximately $35 million in 2025 and facilitate even greater operating leverage thereafter. Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds of approximately $120 million in 2023. As Pat and Tim mentioned, we remain very excited about our long-term growth opportunities and value proposition. As a result, we are guiding full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be between 10% to 13%. We believe the first half of 2023 will see continued headwinds in certain areas, but we expect that pressure to ease in the back half of the year. In addition, we are guiding adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year 2023 to be between 29.0% and 30.0%. We will continue investing in talent during the year, as well as the annualization of our 2022 head count growth, which from a margin perspective, will be partially offset by increases in fiduciary investment income during 2023. These investments, particularly in the recruitment of new colleagues, offer the highest returns for our shareholders, and we continue to aggressively recruit and build out our teams to meet the challenges, demands and opportunities of the marketplace. In summary, we were very pleased with our overall performance in 2022, and we remain very excited for the path ahead. The current economic and insurance cycles present both challenges and opportunities, and our flexible and diversified business model positions us well to best serve our clients in a time where we are more relevant than ever before. With that, we thank you for your time, and we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, the Q4 organic was 10.3%. And, like, you saw the headwinds that you guys spoke about last quarter, and it sounds like you expect them to persist in the first half, right, and then get better but property rates, right, it sounds like you only saw the benefit of that for two weeks, and perhaps you get the benefit, right, throughout '23. So wouldn't the baseline expectation be that all quarters of '23, I guess, should show growth that's a better level than the fourth quarter?\nJeremiah Bickham: Elyse, so we think that our guide range for the year, and again, we want to remind everyone, it is best to look at organic growth on an annual basis, not quarter-to-quarter because you often can't infer a trend. You are correct. The headwinds we referenced that affected us in Q3 and Q4 played out just about as we expected. And then as Tim said in his prepared remarks, they'll continue -- it's our belief they'll continue through at least H1. We did get a pickup from property in late Q4, and we expect that to be a net benefit to us in all of 2023, but it's still too early to tell how much of a lift it will provide on an annual basis, given that there's just so many variables in play, along with general macro uncertainty. And don't forget, we've got extremely tough comps in Q1 -- in Q2. I mean, Tim can provide more color on the property market specifically. But taking a step back, what we do know is that the net of all the headwinds and tailwinds should be positive for us and the E&S market overall. And that our value proposition to our clients is very much intact at the moment.\nElyse Greenspan: And then with your property book is do you have a greater concentration in one quarter versus another? Or would the revenue from property be even throughout the four quarters with some slight variation?\nTim Turner: We do. It's well recorded that the second quarter is the strongest wind buying season, and we expect the flow of business that has increased month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter to continue to increase, and we'll capitalize on that. We're very well positioned on the broking and the underwriting side for that.\nElyse Greenspan: And then lastly, you guys pointed to an active -- it sounds like an active M&A pipeline. Can you just provide a little bit of color just as it looks today, what types of deals you're looking at? And just do you think we might see some deals sooner than later? Or do you have a sense of timing on transactions?\nPat Ryan: We did mention that there is -- I mentioned there is a robust pipeline. And it is, and it's an interesting pipeline, in that there are many companies coming to market. There are companies that we are trying -- convinced to come to market. As you know, Elyse, we look for really good companies to make them better, to make them great companies. And we've had, I think, a successful track record at that. So there is pipeline that I'm referencing are people that we've been speaking with over the -- at least the last 12 months in many cases. And they weren't ready. Some are still not ready, but they're getting closer. Others seem to be getting pretty close, and we're having quite good discussions. To sum it up, I would say that we're at a point in time here starting in 2023 where the prospects for bringing in really high-quality companies that fit our overall strategy in the broadest of ways that we have good confidence that we'll be able to be closing these. We can't tell you when during the year, but we're certainly in deep discussions with a few of them.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Zaremski of BMO Capital Markets.\nMike Zaremski: On the cost efficiency initiative, I was hoping you can just give some more color whether the program is weighted towards distinct buckets. Some of your peers have talked about collapsing back offices and outsourcing and less real estate. Is there anything you'd like to call out? And just on the cost program as well, just some clarification. Just the margin guidance, is that inclusive or exclusive of the charges over the coming two years?\nPat Ryan: Well, thanks, Mike. I'll just start out and turn it over to Jeremiah. These are proactive strategic initiatives. We're always challenging ourselves to improve our ability to serve our clients. So we believe we're taking a great platform to the next level of operating excellence so we can better serve those clients and frankly prepare for the next wave of what we believe is exceptional growth ahead of us. Jeremiah, do you want to pick up?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. Thank you, Pat. So Mike, I know it's hot off the press. But in the 8-K we filed today, we do list out the buckets of all the action areas. And you'll see that the vast majority of the charge and the savings are going to come from ops and technology optimization, which we're really excited about. We think that those actions, those investments will lead to sustainable productivity improvements and savings over time. And just to give you some examples of where we expect efficiencies to come from streamlining our mid- and back-office processes, consolidating and upgrading technology platforms that should drive automation, consolidating vendors and then expanding our shared service model. And I'll also note that the investments that we're accelerating in our data and analytics, we think will help us innovate faster, serve clients with more distinction and help us further differentiate ourselves from our competitors. So we're very excited to kick this program off.\nMike Zaremski: And that, just a clarification. The margin guidance for next year is exclusive of the charges, correct?\nJeremiah Bickham: Correct. Correct.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And as a follow-up, in the prepared remarks, Tim, and I think you touched on it in Elyse's question, mentioned property was very strong in the latter half of 4Q. And just given -- is that continuing into '23. And you guys are very clear about some of the headwinds into the first half of the year. Just curious if that strong -- better than expected property tailwind has persisted a bit into the first part of the year.\nTim Turner: It certainly has. It continues to increase in submission flow rate. The entire channel is growing and expanding rapidly. We're seeing the start of the conversion rates picking up, and we expect that to continue. Reinsurance treaty renewals are expected to be very difficult for 41 and 71, and we see more dumping and shedding of CAT property business in the standard market flowing into our channel.\nMike Zaremski: But just as a follow-up, just to be clear, you're saying, though, you're not seeing much price acceleration in the E&S marketplace inclusive of property, which may be seeing some pricing hardening.\nTim Turner: Well, we're definitely seeing the increases in CAT property, but the entire flow of business in property and casualty and E&S ebbs and flows. So we have some moderating, some price deceleration, but we see prices going up in certain classes like transportation, habitational, healthcare, sports and entertainment, higher education rates continue to climb and terms are -- continue to be difficult in those long-tail casualty classes.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Cox of Goldman Sachs.\nRob Cox: So it looks like just on the margin guide that the midpoint is lower than where you were at for 2022 and double-digit organic growth, the tailwind of a fiduciary investment income. So I'm just wondering what the offset there is you talked about talent investments. Is that the only thing that's really offsetting the margins here? Or is there other investments you're making?\nJeremiah Bickham: Rob, great question. And just to set the table. We've demonstrated that our platform can scale. So we're up 500 basis points since year-end 2019. And if you were to ask any of us in this room a couple of years ago, we would tell you that where we are today, where we finished 2022 is actually a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of a margin basis. And what we said since then is that most years -- not all years, but most years, we can show you scaling on a reported basis. And last year, one thing we were very upfront about and very happy to follow through on is that we're targeting to onboard the biggest production class ever, and we did that. And with that comes a run rate impact in 2023. We're also, as Tim said in his remarks, going to continue making strategic production hires this year. And these investments have the highest ROI of any investment we can make. So we know that it's the right decision for our long-term growth prospects. And so we feel really good about sticking to this game plan. Further, Accelerate 2025, the program that Pat and I have both touched on now, will bring a step change to our margin by 2025, and it will also unlock enhanced annual scaling thereafter. So taking another step back, we feel really good about where we are today in terms of margin, and we believe that we're making the right investments that will continue to enable top line growth and margin growth for the long term.\nRob Cox: Appreciate that. And just next, on the organic guide and the different businesses you have, maybe you could talk about how you think the three businesses could perform relative to the consolidated guide? And how you feel about the capital backing you have on the underwriting management side of the business?\nPat Ryan: Miles, why don't you take the capital?\nMiles Wuller: Yes. I think we've shared in past meetings that -- our growth is not constrained by capital. We're well supported by our carrier partners are -- we've got a great string of delivering underwriting profit to the community and that's allowing them to help support new products, incremental capacity to current lines. And then maybe to the heart of your question, what is going to prompt some continued growth is, we're pleased to share we're coming into the year with incremental property capacity and capability, again, reflective of our great results across the platform. So we believe that we continue to build new facilities and add capacity to existing as a source of ongoing growth.\nPat Ryan: I'll take the first part of the question. We -- following up on what Miles said, we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience significant organic growth in delegated authority underwriting, managing underwriting. I've every reason to believe that the open market wholesale brokerage will have very, very strong growth. As we've said, we started our Alternative Risk vertical, and they've had good organic growth, and we look forward to a significant organic growth there. And as you know, we've been working on the launching of the benefit strategy. These numbers are not in the forecast because we haven't executed yet. But when we execute on the benefit strategy, it will be a higher growth rate than normal in the industry with higher margins than the normal in the industry.\nOperator: The next question is from Weston Bloomer of UBS.\nWeston Bloomer: My first question on $35 million in sales in 2025, should we expect any of the sales to come in 2023 or 2024? Or when should we kind of start to see that ramp up? Is it after you taking the charges? Or how should we think about that?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. So I'll take you through the high-level path on the charges and the saves. So you'll see charges trickle in, in Q1 and Q2 of this year, but they really ramp up in H2. So by the end of this year or let's call it, end of Q1 '24 at the latest, we'll be through more than half of the $65 million charge and then take the remainder through the end of '24. No savings in '23, some savings in '24, which we'll report on as we go. And then the full $35 million will be realized in fiscal year 2025.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. And then my second question is a follow-up around the uplift that you're seeing in property. Just rough math, it seems like it was around a 200 to 300 basis point positive impact in the 4Q. Is it fair to say that's roughly the uplift that you're expecting in 2023 as well? I know you're not -- it could be -- it could change or but I'm curious how you're thinking about that or what's baked into your guidance?\nJeremiah Bickham: There's a lot of variables baked into our guidance. And if you're -- I don't want to imply false precision on any of the math you just threw out. So our guide range for Q4 was 3% to 9%, and we barely beat it at 10.3%. That was mostly attributable to property. As Tim said, the property market is quite hard right now, it could get harder. We expect that to be a net benefit. But in terms of basis points, how much that contributes to the 10% to 13% that -- this year, it's really difficult to calibrate.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. And then on the cadence for organic growth throughout the year, is there any way to quantify maybe first half versus second half? Like is the first half of the year going to be in the mid-single-digit range or upper single-digit range or close to the low end of the guidance? I know you said there's difficult comps in the first half, and we should look at it on a full year basis, but any additional granularity for the 1Q or 2Q would be helpful.\nJeremiah Bickham: You've got the key points. The tougher comps are in H1, and then we expect the worst of our headwinds to manifest in H1. So H1, there's going to be a lot of challenges on an annual basis. We think that we're going to come through quite well, but there's a reason that we only guide on an annual basis, the quarters can be -- the quarters can be difficult to predict or to read into. So let's just stay focused on the 2023 number, which we think will ultimately be a really solid year of organic growth.\nOperator: The next question is from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: A quick clarification question. You mentioned in the third quarter call that no single product line, including public D&O represents 10% of your overall book and property is multiples ahead of D&O. But then when I think about the proportion of property to the overall E&S market, it's something like a 1/4 or 1/3, can you clarify the proportion of property placements more broadly to your overall book? And if that's becoming a larger piece?\nJeremiah Bickham: So Tracy, we've actually said publicly that we're a representative -- our portfolio is representative of the broader E&S market and 25% to 30% is the right range.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. So it was a more narrow view when you previously discussed 10% of a particular product?\nJeremiah Bickham: When we were talking about products on the Q3 call, Tracy, we were giving public D&O as an example of a product and trying to compare that to an entire category of our portfolio in the insurance world overall, right, property and casualty as since our portfolio is representative of the broader market, we were just drawing attention to the difference in scale between our exposure in property versus a single product line like public D&O.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. So that's what I thought. I just wanted to bridge those two comments together, thank you for that. And this one may be a bit of a wildcard question. Can you discuss your process of placing business on behalf of an MGU? What due diligence do you do to ensure that the risk is backed by a rated insurer and also on the back of higher financial line rates, I'm wondering as a corporate buyer of insurance, if you're expecting higher E&O insurance costs and if that's meaningful in any way?\nJeremiah Bickham: Tracy, we've got industry standard procedures whenever we're onboarding a new MGU. We make sure that they're licensed. We make sure that their -- the quality of their security meets our standards for counterparties and things like that. So very much in line with industry standards there. What was the other part of your question?\nTracy Benguigui: I mean, on the back of just higher financial lines rates in general, I mean, a lot of brokers buy E&O insurance. So as a corporate buyer, are you seeing higher costs and if that's meaningful in any way?\nJeremiah Bickham: Well, certainly, our D&O insurance went up significantly when we went public. It's been pretty stable since then. It's too early to talk about any of the renewals for our professional lines, which come up later in the year. So right now, everything looks stable.\nOperator: The next question is from Derek [indiscernible] of KBW.\nUnidentified Analyst: My first question is on fiduciary investment income. It looks like it stepped up $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Is that kind of the sequential step-up that we should think about for 1Q '23?\nJeremiah Bickham: For modeling purposes or what we would recommend -- what we always recommend is to take 30-day term SOFR, minus 50 basis points, and multiply that by our fiduciary income balance, which is broken out on the cash flow statement. At year-end, it was around $770 million. That's what we earn investment income on.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then my second question is on the compensation costs for next year. It looks like you're hiring pretty significantly. But are you anticipating any upwards pressure on comp expenses? I know this is just in context of one of your competitors sold the stake to a private equity firm to create equity incentives for their producers. And I'm wondering if that has any impact on your comp costs?\nJeremiah Bickham: So we are expecting increased comp costs, like I think probably every other company now. But fortunately, the majority of our comp cost is production related and so it's variable to revenue. So wage inflation doesn't affect a wholesale broker, for example, the same way it does a salaried employee. So we're dealing with it like everyone else, but it hasn't gotten out of control for us yet just because of the attribution of our comp that is production related and paid out as a percentage of revenue.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And just to follow up on that. Do you anticipate that impacting your retention of producers? I know Ryan is obviously a great home for talent, but just kind of curious about the impact maybe throughout 2023.\nTim Turner: We expect to continue to have a very high industry-leading retention level for brokers and underwriters and all of our staff. No change at all.\nOperator: The next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: So most of my questions were answered. I just had one on margins. If we think about the midpoint of your guidance in 2023, it's suggesting lower margin than in 2022 despite the fact that your growth has been fairly healthy even with the slowdown. And then on top of that, you've got a restructuring charge, where the costs are going below the line, the benefits are going to go above the line. So I'm wondering if -- like is this because of a lot of your expenses being variable in nature where there's less leverage in the business to growth in revenues or any sort of fee pressure, commission pressure or any that sort -- and I do recognize the comments about wanting to grow the business, but it is somewhat surprising that margins are not improving with the strong growth that you've had and fairly strong growth that you're projecting?\nJeremiah Bickham: Jimmy, as I said, the business model is proven to scale. We were at 25% margin at the end of 2019, we're at 30% at the end of 2022. What we've tried to be upfront and consistent about is making long-term investments in talent is the right thing to do to keep up our differentiated growth. We saw a big opportunity last year. We made it. There's a run rate impact for this year. There's an opportunity this year that we want to capitalize on. Like, that's the right playbook, and we're planning to stick to it. It won't be the case every year that we have an outsized opportunity like we saw in 2022. And so I'll go back to my prior statements, many years, not all, but many years, you will see scaling. And what we're really excited -- one thing we're excited about for Accelerate 2025 is that we're going to get a step change in margin once the program is fully built out. And the capabilities, the efficiencies that we're going to gain are going to make our continual annual scaling that much more rapid. So the model scales, Jimmy, it's just when we have the opportunity, we think it makes sense to reinvest in our talent.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on the uptick in sort of activity that you saw in your business in late December, are you able to comment if that's continued through January and February as well, recognizing that certain business is booked more in a certain quarter and less in another quarter. But has that uptick in activity continued through the first half of this quarter?\nJeremiah Bickham: Sorry, Jimmy, when you say uptick in activity, what are you referring to?\nJimmy Bhullar: Or you're just saying you saw stronger activity in the last two weeks of December, which caused you to do better on growth than you had previously indicated?\nJeremiah Bickham: Right. Okay. Yes, the comments on the late surge in property that benefited the quarterly organic, yes, we're -- and Tim touched on the ongoing state of play with regards to property. It's -- we're still seeing a benefit from that as we sit here today.\nJimmy Bhullar: And despite that, your assumption for growth in the first half being less than in 4Q, is that a function of just booking less property revenues in the first half of the -- or in the first quarter early on? Or is it something else that's gotten worse?\nJeremiah Bickham: We actually haven't made any statement about the growth of H1 relative to Q4, just that we've got tough comps. There's headwinds we know about, so we know that it's going to be a challenging H1. But the important thing to do is to focus on the annual growth rate, which we think is going to be a very healthy 10% to 13%.\nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: I guess, just thinking about the 2023 organic growth guide, it sounds like which being explicitly contemplated are some comp issues and project-related business like D&O, construction and also a net benefit from property. But I was just curious if what other assumptions you might be making on how market conditions might evolve through the year and coming up to the 10% to 13%?\nJeremiah Bickham: So in any given year, there's going to be pluses and minuses, Tim referenced ebbs and flows with related to business that moves between the E&S market and the admitted market. There's lines that are still firming and there's lines that are going the other direction rapidly. We've talked extensively about public D&O as an example of that. So we're factoring all of that in. And what we do on an annual basis is we person-by-person, MGU-by-MGU, broker-by-broker, do a bottom-up build of their book. And we put that all together, we improve it with any other market-based intelligence we have, but it is what it is. And fortunately, the sum of all the opportunities and challenges for '23 is what we anticipate to be a really positive result.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then, I guess, another question I had was -- I guess with P&C brokers, we tend to think about a lot of the businesses being recurring. But I was curious, like, is there an outsized amount of your annual commissions that come from the project-based world, whether it's construction or D&O tied to an M&A transaction like that type of thing. I was wondering if maybe you could quantify, like, how much usually of your book is project-based?\nJeremiah Bickham: So we don't disclose the specific percentage, but most of it is recurring type business. In fact, nearly all of it is commercial. We've publicly disclosed that we're over 70% E&S. And most importantly, the majority of the products that we work, we place or underwrite on behalf of our clients is compulsory.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then -- sorry, my last question is just on -- you said property performed well in the last couple of weeks of the year. Just from a timing standpoint in the fourth quarter, are there an outsized percentage of property renewals that take place at the end of that quarter? Or are they pretty uniformly distributed through 4Q?\nTim Turner: No, they continue to increase as we go into the new year. The wind buying season is well known to peak in the second quarter actually. But as I said earlier, the reinsurance treaty renewals of 41 and 71 will have a further hardening impact on the flow of CAT property business into our channel. So we expect it to continue to grow and expand, and we're set up perfectly to absorb it and convert it. So the market is definitely going to get harder in property.\nRyan Tunis: Sorry, let me clarify my question. I wasn't sure if maybe there were some renewals in the fourth quarter that were just standard property that got pushed to late in December just because of the market was becoming more challenging. I just didn't know if there were an outsized percentage of renewals that ended up taking place in those last couple of weeks.\nTim Turner: No, nothing to measure, but definitely rate increases and premium increases.\nOperator: There are no additional questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Pat Ryan for closing remarks.\nPat Ryan: Well, thank you all for your participation and your interest in our company. As I look to the year ahead, we're really filled with optimism. We've got a great team. The impact in the marketplace is strong, very strong drive, unwavering drive. We think world-class expertise and deep commitment to serving our clients. So we're confident that we'll continue to drive growth and success in this year of 2023. So thanks for your participation and your very good questions. Have a good evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Tim. In Q4, we grew total revenue 14.9% period-over-period to $435 million, fueled by another solid quarter of organic revenue growth at 10.3%, reflecting ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market and continuing to win a substantial amount of new business. We were pleased to see the strength in property late in Q4, specifically in the last two weeks of December, which drove the modest outperformance versus our expectations for the quarter. Net income for Q4 '22 was $46 million or $0.14 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO-related and other unusual items, was $74 million or $0.27 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the fourth quarter grew 6% period-over-period, to $127 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 250 basis points to 29.3%. Our adjusted EBITDAC margin was impacted by continued investments in the business and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels, which was partially offset by higher fiduciary investment income. As Pat noted, in 2023, we expect to continue bringing aboard top underwriting and broking talent wherever we see clear opportunities to grow lines of business. We also expect to recruit a significant class of new talent at Ryan Specialty in the months ahead. In addition, as we noted in our release earlier today and in Pat's earlier remarks, we are embarking on our Accelerate 2025 program, which will strengthen how Ryan Specialty operates and further improves our efficiency and unlocks additional value for our clients and shareholders. Over the last four years alone, our revenue has more than doubled, head count is up 50%, and all while the U.S. E&S market has grown by over 80%. We believe this is the right time to continue building on our success and have thoughtfully designed a program that will prepare Ryan Specialty for the next cycle of growth. Accelerate 2025 will result in approximately $65 million of cumulative charges through 2024. In turn, we expect it to generate annual savings of approximately $35 million in 2025 and facilitate even greater operating leverage thereafter. Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds of approximately $120 million in 2023. As Pat and Tim mentioned, we remain very excited about our long-term growth opportunities and value proposition. As a result, we are guiding full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be between 10% to 13%. We believe the first half of 2023 will see continued headwinds in certain areas, but we expect that pressure to ease in the back half of the year. In addition, we are guiding adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year 2023 to be between 29.0% and 30.0%. We will continue investing in talent during the year, as well as the annualization of our 2022 head count growth, which from a margin perspective, will be partially offset by increases in fiduciary investment income during 2023. These investments, particularly in the recruitment of new colleagues, offer the highest returns for our shareholders, and we continue to aggressively recruit and build out our teams to meet the challenges, demands and opportunities of the marketplace. In summary, we were very pleased with our overall performance in 2022, and we remain very excited for the path ahead. The current economic and insurance cycles present both challenges and opportunities, and our flexible and diversified business model positions us well to best serve our clients in a time where we are more relevant than ever before. With that, we thank you for your time, and we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Elyse, so we think that our guide range for the year, and again, we want to remind everyone, it is best to look at organic growth on an annual basis, not quarter-to-quarter because you often can't infer a trend. You are correct. The headwinds we referenced that affected us in Q3 and Q4 played out just about as we expected. And then as Tim said in his prepared remarks, they'll continue -- it's our belief they'll continue through at least H1. We did get a pickup from property in late Q4, and we expect that to be a net benefit to us in all of 2023, but it's still too early to tell how much of a lift it will provide on an annual basis, given that there's just so many variables in play, along with general macro uncertainty. And don't forget, we've got extremely tough comps in Q1 -- in Q2. I mean, Tim can provide more color on the property market specifically. But taking a step back, what we do know is that the net of all the headwinds and tailwinds should be positive for us and the E&S market overall. And that our value proposition to our clients is very much intact at the moment. Yes. Thank you, Pat. So Mike, I know it's hot off the press. But in the 8-K we filed today, we do list out the buckets of all the action areas. And you'll see that the vast majority of the charge and the savings are going to come from ops and technology optimization, which we're really excited about. We think that those actions, those investments will lead to sustainable productivity improvements and savings over time. And just to give you some examples of where we expect efficiencies to come from streamlining our mid- and back-office processes, consolidating and upgrading technology platforms that should drive automation, consolidating vendors and then expanding our shared service model. And I'll also note that the investments that we're accelerating in our data and analytics, we think will help us innovate faster, serve clients with more distinction and help us further differentiate ourselves from our competitors. So we're very excited to kick this program off. Correct. Correct. Rob, great question. And just to set the table. We've demonstrated that our platform can scale. So we're up 500 basis points since year-end 2019. And if you were to ask any of us in this room a couple of years ago, we would tell you that where we are today, where we finished 2022 is actually a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of a margin basis. And what we said since then is that most years -- not all years, but most years, we can show you scaling on a reported basis. And last year, one thing we were very upfront about and very happy to follow through on is that we're targeting to onboard the biggest production class ever, and we did that. And with that comes a run rate impact in 2023. We're also, as Tim said in his remarks, going to continue making strategic production hires this year. And these investments have the highest ROI of any investment we can make. So we know that it's the right decision for our long-term growth prospects. And so we feel really good about sticking to this game plan. Further, Accelerate 2025, the program that Pat and I have both touched on now, will bring a step change to our margin by 2025, and it will also unlock enhanced annual scaling thereafter. So taking another step back, we feel really good about where we are today in terms of margin, and we believe that we're making the right investments that will continue to enable top line growth and margin growth for the long term. Yes. So I'll take you through the high-level path on the charges and the saves. So you'll see charges trickle in, in Q1 and Q2 of this year, but they really ramp up in H2. So by the end of this year or let's call it, end of Q1 '24 at the latest, we'll be through more than half of the $65 million charge and then take the remainder through the end of '24. No savings in '23, some savings in '24, which we'll report on as we go. And then the full $35 million will be realized in fiscal year 2025. There's a lot of variables baked into our guidance. And if you're -- I don't want to imply false precision on any of the math you just threw out. So our guide range for Q4 was 3% to 9%, and we barely beat it at 10.3%. That was mostly attributable to property. As Tim said, the property market is quite hard right now, it could get harder. We expect that to be a net benefit. But in terms of basis points, how much that contributes to the 10% to 13% that -- this year, it's really difficult to calibrate. You've got the key points. The tougher comps are in H1, and then we expect the worst of our headwinds to manifest in H1. So H1, there's going to be a lot of challenges on an annual basis. We think that we're going to come through quite well, but there's a reason that we only guide on an annual basis, the quarters can be -- the quarters can be difficult to predict or to read into. So let's just stay focused on the 2023 number, which we think will ultimately be a really solid year of organic growth. So Tracy, we've actually said publicly that we're a representative -- our portfolio is representative of the broader E&S market and 25% to 30% is the right range. When we were talking about products on the Q3 call, Tracy, we were giving public D&O as an example of a product and trying to compare that to an entire category of our portfolio in the insurance world overall, right, property and casualty as since our portfolio is representative of the broader market, we were just drawing attention to the difference in scale between our exposure in property versus a single product line like public D&O. Tracy, we've got industry standard procedures whenever we're onboarding a new MGU. We make sure that they're licensed. We make sure that their -- the quality of their security meets our standards for counterparties and things like that. So very much in line with industry standards there. What was the other part of your question? Well, certainly, our D&O insurance went up significantly when we went public. It's been pretty stable since then. It's too early to talk about any of the renewals for our professional lines, which come up later in the year. So right now, everything looks stable. For modeling purposes or what we would recommend -- what we always recommend is to take 30-day term SOFR, minus 50 basis points, and multiply that by our fiduciary income balance, which is broken out on the cash flow statement. At year-end, it was around $770 million. That's what we earn investment income on. So we are expecting increased comp costs, like I think probably every other company now. But fortunately, the majority of our comp cost is production related and so it's variable to revenue. So wage inflation doesn't affect a wholesale broker, for example, the same way it does a salaried employee. So we're dealing with it like everyone else, but it hasn't gotten out of control for us yet just because of the attribution of our comp that is production related and paid out as a percentage of revenue. Jimmy, as I said, the business model is proven to scale. We were at 25% margin at the end of 2019, we're at 30% at the end of 2022. What we've tried to be upfront and consistent about is making long-term investments in talent is the right thing to do to keep up our differentiated growth. We saw a big opportunity last year. We made it. There's a run rate impact for this year. There's an opportunity this year that we want to capitalize on. Like, that's the right playbook, and we're planning to stick to it. It won't be the case every year that we have an outsized opportunity like we saw in 2022. And so I'll go back to my prior statements, many years, not all, but many years, you will see scaling. And what we're really excited -- one thing we're excited about for Accelerate 2025 is that we're going to get a step change in margin once the program is fully built out. And the capabilities, the efficiencies that we're going to gain are going to make our continual annual scaling that much more rapid. So the model scales, Jimmy, it's just when we have the opportunity, we think it makes sense to reinvest in our talent. Sorry, Jimmy, when you say uptick in activity, what are you referring to? Right. Okay. Yes, the comments on the late surge in property that benefited the quarterly organic, yes, we're -- and Tim touched on the ongoing state of play with regards to property. It's -- we're still seeing a benefit from that as we sit here today. We actually haven't made any statement about the growth of H1 relative to Q4, just that we've got tough comps. There's headwinds we know about, so we know that it's going to be a challenging H1. But the important thing to do is to focus on the annual growth rate, which we think is going to be a very healthy 10% to 13%. So in any given year, there's going to be pluses and minuses, Tim referenced ebbs and flows with related to business that moves between the E&S market and the admitted market. There's lines that are still firming and there's lines that are going the other direction rapidly. We've talked extensively about public D&O as an example of that. So we're factoring all of that in. And what we do on an annual basis is we person-by-person, MGU-by-MGU, broker-by-broker, do a bottom-up build of their book. And we put that all together, we improve it with any other market-based intelligence we have, but it is what it is. And fortunately, the sum of all the opportunities and challenges for '23 is what we anticipate to be a really positive result. So we don't disclose the specific percentage, but most of it is recurring type business. In fact, nearly all of it is commercial. We've publicly disclosed that we're over 70% E&S. And most importantly, the majority of the products that we work, we place or underwrite on behalf of our clients is compulsory."

            "name": "Pat Ryan",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results. Joining us on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; and our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller. Before we discuss Ryan's Specialty's 2022 performance, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the passing of Andrew J. McKenna. Andy was an invaluable member of our Board since its inception in 2012, serving on the Compensation and Governance Committee and as our Lead Director. Andy was a national voice on the topic of corporate governance, Chicago institution, business icon, humanitarian, philanthropist, husband, father, brother and the dear friend. He will be missed by all who knew him. 2022 was an outstanding year for Ryan Specialty. The tireless efforts and dedication of our brokers, underwriters and the entire Ryan Specialty team is evident in our results. For the full year, we generated record revenue of over $1.7 billion, driven by organic growth of 16.4% on top of 22.4% in 2021, and produced a strong adjusted EBITDAC margin of 30%. I want to take a few minutes to highlight some noteworthy achievements in 2022, which were significant for our firm. We invested in an exceptional talent while onboarding the largest production class in our history. We enhanced our capabilities through new product offerings and integrated our 2021 acquisitions of Keystone and Crouse, both of which exceeded their growth goals for the first year as a part of the Ryan Specialty team. We were pleased to announce a highly strategic acquisition, Griffin Underwriting Services, which closed on January 3 of this year. With approximately $23 million in revenue, Griffin deepens our offerings in the Pacific Northwest, broadening our geographic scope and our capabilities and binding authority and brokerage specialties. Importantly, Griffin's consistent underwriting results, deep bench of talent and focus on training and development is a clear cultural match with Ryan Specialty. Further enhancing Ryan Specialty's a central role as a trading partner to our retailers. Continuing our winning culture, I'm pleased to report another year of 97% retention of our producers, consistent with 2021. For the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 14.9%, led by 10.3% organic growth. We also grew our adjusted EBITDAC and generated another quarter of solid adjusted net income. In the fourth quarter, the specific headwinds, we noted on our prior call, were in line with our expectations. We anticipate that these headwinds will persist into at least the first half of 2023. That said, we were very pleased to see the strength in property manifest itself late in Q4, which drove the modest outperformance versus our expectations for the quarter. As we progress through 2023, there are three things we believe you can expect from Ryan Specialty. First, we see continued solid growth in the business. Although there is heightened macro uncertainty, the complexity of risk continues to increase. And as a result, we believe the E&S market will continue to be a standout within the insurance industry. We expect our growth will be balanced across our diverse portfolio of products and solutions, enabling us to capture the broader E&S tailwinds while capitalizing on specific areas of accelerated growth. We expect to grow our business through M&A. Our pipeline remains robust, both in tuck-ins and some larger platform opportunities. We continue to focus on M&A opportunities with the highest quality specialty distributors including wholesale, delegated authority and benefits. We will also look to grow our business through our alternative risk strategy, arranging alternative capital to support our clients, expanding our addressable market and building on our culture of innovation. Second, we will continue to invest in our business. We expect another year of targeted hiring, adding industry top talent in both underwriting and broking or the needed most as well as continuing to build our internship program at Ryan Specialty University. We will also make additional investment in our delegated authority specialties, including the systems and technology to further enhance our actuarial risk management and loss control teams. And third, we will execute on strategic initiatives to increase the scalability of our operating platform. Today, we are announcing the launch of Accelerate 2025, a two-year restructuring program effective in Q1. Through this program, we're making changes and investments that will enable continued growth, drive innovation and deliver sustainable productivity improvements over the long term. Accelerate 2025 is a natural progression of our strategy that brings together our people and assets in a way that allows us to continue to rapidly innovate and more efficiently provide new and improved solutions to the most complex challenges that our clients face. Jeremiah will provide more details in his remarks, but we anticipate a cumulative special charge of approximately $65 million through 2024. We expect the program will deliver approximately $35 million of annual savings in 2025 and further enhance our ability to scale our platform in the years beyond. Accelerate 2025 is designed in concert with our growth strategy, and we will continue to make investment decisions including hiring and M&A based on a disciplined return on capital basis, both now and in the future. Looking forward, I'm confident that 2023 will be another strong year for our firm. We expect sustained growth and have a flexible business model that allows us to quickly adapt and pivot to changing market conditions. As we've noted previously, risks across industries are only becoming more complex, and the E&S market has continued to outpace the overall P&C insurance market. Our products are larger compulsory and our clients and trading partners value the unparalleled expertise we bring as we anticipate our needs and work tirelessly to provide the right solutions for our insurers. This, along with our other secular growth drivers, should allow us to continue generating double-digit organic growth over the long term. In summary, I'm very proud of our entire team for delivering outstanding results for our clients, trading partners and shareholders in a challenging insurance market and macro environment. Through innovation and exceptional customer service, we have once again validated our differentiated business model and continue to be a trusted partner to substantially all of the top 100 retailers. Now, I'll turn it over to Tim. Tim? We did mention that there is -- I mentioned there is a robust pipeline. And it is, and it's an interesting pipeline, in that there are many companies coming to market. There are companies that we are trying -- convinced to come to market. As you know, Elyse, we look for really good companies to make them better, to make them great companies. And we've had, I think, a successful track record at that. So there is pipeline that I'm referencing are people that we've been speaking with over the -- at least the last 12 months in many cases. And they weren't ready. Some are still not ready, but they're getting closer. Others seem to be getting pretty close, and we're having quite good discussions. To sum it up, I would say that we're at a point in time here starting in 2023 where the prospects for bringing in really high-quality companies that fit our overall strategy in the broadest of ways that we have good confidence that we'll be able to be closing these. We can't tell you when during the year, but we're certainly in deep discussions with a few of them. Well, thanks, Mike. I'll just start out and turn it over to Jeremiah. These are proactive strategic initiatives. We're always challenging ourselves to improve our ability to serve our clients. So we believe we're taking a great platform to the next level of operating excellence so we can better serve those clients and frankly prepare for the next wave of what we believe is exceptional growth ahead of us. Jeremiah, do you want to pick up? Miles, why don't you take the capital? I'll take the first part of the question. We -- following up on what Miles said, we have experienced and we expect to continue to experience significant organic growth in delegated authority underwriting, managing underwriting. I've every reason to believe that the open market wholesale brokerage will have very, very strong growth. As we've said, we started our Alternative Risk vertical, and they've had good organic growth, and we look forward to a significant organic growth there. And as you know, we've been working on the launching of the benefit strategy. These numbers are not in the forecast because we haven't executed yet. But when we execute on the benefit strategy, it will be a higher growth rate than normal in the industry with higher margins than the normal in the industry. Well, thank you all for your participation and your interest in our company. As I look to the year ahead, we're really filled with optimism. We've got a great team. The impact in the marketplace is strong, very strong drive, unwavering drive. We think world-class expertise and deep commitment to serving our clients. So we're confident that we'll continue to drive growth and success in this year of 2023. So thanks for your participation and your very good questions. Have a good evening."

            "name": "Miles Wuller",
            "content": "Yes. I think we've shared in past meetings that -- our growth is not constrained by capital. We're well supported by our carrier partners are -- we've got a great string of delivering underwriting profit to the community and that's allowing them to help support new products, incremental capacity to current lines. And then maybe to the heart of your question, what is going to prompt some continued growth is, we're pleased to share we're coming into the year with incremental property capacity and capability, again, reflective of our great results across the platform. So we believe that we continue to build new facilities and add capacity to existing as a source of ongoing growth."

            "name": "Tim Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. It was another solid quarter and year across our specialties. These results are a testament to the teamwork across the firm, from our producers to our underwriters and their teams. As Pat noted, the E&S market continued to grow in importance to the insurance industry, and we capitalized on these industry trends. Diving into our specialties. Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty achieved another quarter of solid growth spread across many lines of business. Property continues to experience a historically hard market as rates rose significantly and capacity tightened. We are seeing a large volume of new business flow into the non-admitted market, and we remain very encouraged by Property's potential looking ahead. As we've noted previously, major events such as Hurricane Ian, winter storms and other climate events as well as a tougher reinsurance renewal process have led to less capacity as well as even higher rates. This is producing increasing demand for insurance solutions and a recurring opportunity for our experience and expertise to fill that need. Cyber performed well in the fourth quarter and for the year. While we continue to see a moderation in rate increases, we believe there is ample runway for us to pursue regardless of short-term pricing trends. Our technical expertise in areas like cyber is playing a significant role in our ability to build large towers of capacity for our clients. Our transportation practice, particularly in trucking, continues to see substantial flow fueled by social inflation, and ensure a need for continued rate increases. We continue to win new business and remain well positioned for 2023 to capitalize on additional growth opportunities. In our Binding Authority specialty, we saw another quarter of solid growth in traditional binding, which includes small commercial business that has historically been economically sensitive. This growth was partially offset by our personal lines Binding Authority, which was still experiencing capacity constraints prior to renewals. We continue to see the potential for panel consolidation as a long and steady growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to execute. Our underwriting management specialty posted another strong quarter led by property and casualty, healthcare and our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re, despite headwinds in our transactional liability lines, driven by lower M&A volume. As Pat noted, in the fourth quarter, the specific headwinds in certain lines we raised on our prior call are rapid rate decline in public company D&O, lower external M&A and IPO volumes and transactional liability and delayed project-based starts in construction were in line with our expectations. We anticipate that these headwinds will persist into at least the first half of 2023. We remain confident that we have the right teams in place to grow these lines over the long term. In terms of the E&S market, our observation is that pricing has remained firm in January and into February in most classes of business with public company D&O being the ongoing exception. In addition, the standard market carrier competition we observed on the periphery and which we flagged on prior earning calls, has yet to meaningfully impact rate or flow in the aggregate. As we've said previously, we expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our fourth quarter. Thank you. We do. It's well recorded that the second quarter is the strongest wind buying season, and we expect the flow of business that has increased month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter to continue to increase, and we'll capitalize on that. We're very well positioned on the broking and the underwriting side for that. It certainly has. It continues to increase in submission flow rate. The entire channel is growing and expanding rapidly. We're seeing the start of the conversion rates picking up, and we expect that to continue. Reinsurance treaty renewals are expected to be very difficult for 41 and 71, and we see more dumping and shedding of CAT property business in the standard market flowing into our channel. Well, we're definitely seeing the increases in CAT property, but the entire flow of business in property and casualty and E&S ebbs and flows. So we have some moderating, some price deceleration, but we see prices going up in certain classes like transportation, habitational, healthcare, sports and entertainment, higher education rates continue to climb and terms are -- continue to be difficult in those long-tail casualty classes. We expect to continue to have a very high industry-leading retention level for brokers and underwriters and all of our staff. No change at all. No, they continue to increase as we go into the new year. The wind buying season is well known to peak in the second quarter actually. But as I said earlier, the reinsurance treaty renewals of 41 and 71 will have a further hardening impact on the flow of CAT property business into our channel. So we expect it to continue to grow and expand, and we're set up perfectly to absorb it and convert it. So the market is definitely going to get harder in property. No, nothing to measure, but definitely rate increases and premium increases."

Noah, you may now begin.\nNoah Angeletti: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Ryan Specialty Holdings Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. In addition to this call, we filed a press release with the SEC earlier this afternoon, which has been posted to our website at ryanspecialty.com. On today\u2019s call, management\u2019s prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. These statements are based on management\u2019s current expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We encourage listeners to review the more detailed discussion of these risk factors contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC. We assume no duty to update such forward-looking statements in the future, except as required by law. Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP are included in our earnings release, which is filed with the SEC and available on the company\u2019s website. With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryan Specialty, Pat Ryan.\nPat Ryan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. Joining us on today\u2019s call is our President, Tim Turner; and our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham. Also joining is Miles Wuller, CEO of our Underwriting Managers Specialty who will be around for the Q&A. It was a solid quarter for Ryan Specialty and our differentiated platform. Total revenue grew 16.8%, led by 13.7% organic growth. In addition, we achieved double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and solid growth in adjusted net income. Specific to the third quarter, our hard market for rates largely continued, and we saw additional firming in many of our lines of business. As we noted last quarter, one notable exception was public company D&O, which saw a rapid rate decline in the quarter beyond what we and the market anticipated and which Tim will touch upon shortly. Importantly, our ability to generate another quarter of double-digit organic growth despite this headwind and the exceptional third quarter 2021 comp speaks volumes about the strength of our team, our diverse product and services offering and the winning culture we have built at Ryan Specialty. As we\u2019ve noted previously, risks across industries are only becoming more complex. Our products are largely compulsory and our clients value the expertise we bring. Our producers continue to provide our clients and our trading partners with innovative solutions, but we want to acknowledge that the increasingly challenging insurance and macroeconomic environment in specifically three areas where we are seeing headwinds that will likely carry into at least the first half of 2023. First, while the E&S marketplace remains a standout within the insurance industry, we began to see a deceleration in the growth rate of inbound flow towards the end of the quarter, which is backed by state stamping reports. Second, a faster-than-anticipated economic deceleration coupled with significantly higher interest rates are delaying certain project-based construction policies, along with M&A transaction liability policies that rely on highly functioning debt markets. Third, changing market conditions in the public D&O market have had an impact on our professional lines book. After years of rate hardening, new capacity entered the market leading to additional supply and a decrease in rate at a time when IPO activity is down significantly. This has also led to increased opportunities for retail brokers to place some of this business directly. Our collective experience has allowed us to successfully manage through different economic cycles in the past. And we are confident that our leadership team is well positioned to execute our game plan through the cycle as well. We are also pleased to note that productivity among our brokers continues to improve, a testament to their tireless efforts to be laser-focused on client centricity and to match market needs with industry-leading expertise. We are also prudently continuing to onboard top decile talent to add to our industry-leading team and deep bench to take advantage of the resilient E&S flow and continue gaining market share. Additionally, our M&A pipeline remains robust as we look for additional opportunities, both tuck-ins and larger acquisitions to enhance and differentiate our platform and capabilities. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions, particularly in the current environment as we will only move forward when all our criteria are met. Every acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. Our discipline is bolstered by our core results, which have proven throughout this year that we do not require acquisitions to achieve robust growth in any given period. As we begin to turn the page on 2022, we believe we remain well positioned to succeed over the long term given our resilient and flexible operating model that enables us to quickly adapt and pivot to an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment. We nonetheless remain confident that the value we bring to our trading partners, particularly in times of uncertainty remains extremely valuable as we anticipate their needs and work tirelessly to provide the right solutions to protect their insurance risks. As it has in the past, we expect the E&S market will continue to grow as the world becomes riskier and more complex. This, along with other secular growth drivers, should allow us to generate annual double-digit organic growth for years to come. In summary, I remain proud of our entire team at Ryan Specialty as their incredible effort led to another solid quarter and 2022 will surpass our expectations from when we started the year. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim. Tim?\nTim Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. As Pat highlighted, it was another solid quarter across our specialties, and the E&S market continues to serve a critical role in an increasingly challenging insurance landscape. This is backed up by A.M. BEST\u2019s recent report, which highlighted the sustained expansion and rise in demand for E&S solutions driven by constantly evolving risks and rapidly innovating technology. We are in a prime position to continue to capitalize on these positive trends. Diving into our specialties, our wholesale brokerage specialty achieved another quarter of strong growth across property and casualty lines of business. Once again, CAT property was the strongest driver of new business into the non-admitted market. Since our last call, Hurricane Ian, a devastating storm caused tens of billions of dollars of damage. I would like to take a minute to send our best wishes to all of those that were impacted by this horrible disaster. We believe these types of loss events along with themes we\u2019ve previously discussed are leading to shrinking capacity as well as even higher rates. Ultimately, we believe these factors will lead to more flow into the E&S market as reinsurers further de-risk their portfolios during upcoming renewal cycles. We also expect increased flow from other non-CAT markets. There will be a significant need for E&S solutions in 2023, and our depth and breadth of experience and products will remain in high demand. We will continue to develop innovative solutions in our brokerage and delegated underwriting authority businesses in these high-hazard niches in order to take advantage of these incoming opportunities. Cyber was a strong performer in the quarter. Flow continued to be robust into the E&S channel. As noted previously, we complement our brokers with capacity from our delegated underwriting authorities as evidenced by our announcement of a new $15 million exclusive excess cyber facility supported by highly rated carriers. It\u2019s another example of our brokers innovating on behalf of their clients as well as a staying power our delegated authority demonstrates and how it continues to be a top choice for carrier capital. Our transportation practice, particularly in trucking, continues to see sizable flows. We continue to win business in this line and remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities. Our construction practice performed well in the quarter. We are encouraged by the submissions that we\u2019re seeing in the current pipeline of projects. However, we should note that we\u2019ve begun to observe delayed project starts due to the rapid increase in interest rates and a slowdown in the economy. As Pat noted, our public company D&O practice experienced some headwinds in the quarter as well. As we noted on our prior call, we began to see rate decreases in public company D&O during the second quarter. In the third quarter, the pace of rate decreases in that line accelerated. This and the market forces that Pat referenced are what we began to observe earlier this year and have referenced in prior calls. These had a significant mitigating impact on the strong growth in our other lines. We expect these trends in public company D&O to continue into at least mid-2023. However, we are confident that we have the team and platform in place to continue to grow in this line over the long term. In our Binding Authority specialty, we saw solid growth in traditional binding, which includes small commercial business that has historically been economically sensitive. This growth was reduced by our personal lines Binding Authority, which has experienced capacity constraints, an area of focus for our upcoming carrier renewals. Additionally, the panel consolidation opportunity that we\u2019ve mentioned for a number of quarters is just beginning to bear fruit. We see this as a long and steady growth opportunity and we are well positioned to execute. Our Underwriting Management specialty posted another strong quarter despite dislocated debt capital markets and less M&A activity, resulting in less transactional liability business being bound while continuing to deliver solid underwriting results for our carrier trading partners. We are also seeing continued progress with our de novos through our Harleysville of New York arrangement with Nationwide. In terms of the E&S market, pricing remains firm in many classes of business, with the notable exception of public company D&O rates that Pat mentioned earlier and Cyber, where we are seeing a flattening in rate. As we\u2019ve said several times before, we expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty\u2019s growth opportunity, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our third quarter. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q3, we grew total revenue 16.8% period-over-period to $412 million, which was fueled by another solid quarter of organic revenue growth at 13.7%, reflecting the ongoing tailwinds in most of the E&S market and continuing to win a substantial amount of new business despite the nearly 29% year-over-year comp. Net income for Q3 2022 was $29 million or $0.09 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO-related and other unusual items, increased 6% period-over-period to $67 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the third quarter grew 11% period-over-period to $117 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 140 basis points to 28.4%. Our adjusted EBITDAC margin was impacted by continued investments in the business and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels and also improved by higher fiduciary income. It should be noted that relative to Q3 of 2019, which had a full run rate of T&E, our margin was up 450 basis points in the quarter, again, showing the proven scalability of our model over the years. Moving forward, we will prudently continue our hiring practice of finding the industry\u2019s top talent in both underwriting and broking where there are clear opportunities to grow lines of business. We also fully intend to continue investing in our platform, which allows us to generate sustainable margins while producing industry-leading organic revenue growth. As we do so, we will continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and industry for additional signs of slowing to ensure that our investments in talent and infrastructure are accretive. Furthermore, our balance sheet remains fortified with $833 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, in addition to our $600 million of undrawn revolving credit facilities. To that end, it has always been important to us to maintain a strong financial position. I want to highlight our timely capital raise at the beginning of this year before the cycle of steep rate hikes began, which diversified our funding sources. We expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds and includes amortization on our interest rate cap of approximately $31 million for Q4 2022. And for the first time, we are beginning to receive payments under our interest rate cap. Again, it is important to be mindful that the impact of increased interest expense is mitigated by the natural hedge on our fiduciary balances, which benefit from the rising rate environment. These fiduciary balances continue to generate fiduciary investment income at approximately one month term SOFR, less approximately 50 basis points. This spread to SOFR factors in earnings yield that may lag the forward curve as well as some fiduciary balances, which are not permitted to earn yield or that earn soft yield that is instead an offset to our bank fees and SG&A expense. Additionally, it is important for us to note that given the timing of our M&A pipeline, it is unlikely that we will close a sizable deal in Q4. But as Pat mentioned, our M&A pipeline remains robust, and we remain disciplined in our approach. Taking a step back, through our first nine months, we generated exceptional organic growth and healthy adjusted EBITDAC margin. As Pat and Tim mentioned, the long-term Ryan story remains very much intact. However, given current headwinds in public company D&O and macroeconomic headwinds impacting construction starts and M&A transaction liability activity, we are lowering our full year 2022 guidance for organic revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.0% from the previous guide range of 16.5% to 18.0%. This implies a mid-single-digit midpoint for organic revenue growth in Q4. This guide range is ahead of where our expectations were for full year 2022 at the beginning of the year when it was difficult to predict the timing and degree of these market changes and macroeconomic impacts. In addition, we are now guiding our adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year 2022 to be between 29.5% and 30.0% from the previous guide range of 29.0% to 30.0%. In summary, we remain very pleased with our performance year-to-date and are focused on the path ahead as we navigate through the coming economic cycle. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our First question is coming from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi thanks. Good evening. My first question, you guys said that you\u2019re expecting a slowdown in organic growth to the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Is there an over concentration in public D&O, M&A and some of these other lines that you\u2019re calling out is having headwinds in the fourth quarter? Because from Pat\u2019s comments, it sounds like you guys are still looking for consistent double-digit organic growth. So, would you expect things to pick up to that level next year? I\u2019m just wondering how business mix is impacting the fourth quarter versus what we could see in 2023.\nJeremiah Bickham: Elyse, thank you for your question. So we are, in fact, still double-digit growers on an annual basis. We are talking about Q4. And like we\u2019ve said in the quarters of 20% plus growth, you can\u2019t look at any quarter up or down and extrapolate a trend. To your question about concentration, I can say that no single product line, including public D&O, is even 10% of our overall book. We have a very overall well-diversified portfolio of products and specialties. It\u2019s just last year, public D&O specifically, had an outsized growth contribution. And this quarter, it actually shrank dramatically. So it went from being a contributor to a drag on our organic. But we are confident that D&O in our entire professional lines practice is one that we\u2019re very strong in and that we can continue to grow long term.\nElyse Greenspan: And then in terms of the property exposure, could you give us a sense how big that is of your book? And I would think that when we think about 2023 and the market hardening post hurricane Ian. If that could be a tailwind to your growth next year?\nJeremiah Bickham: So in terms of the property exposure, well, I want to say, be careful and not use exposure and insinuate underwriting risk exposure. The percentage of our book that is related to property is many, many multiples of our D&O book. We don\u2019t disclose the exact percentage, but it\u2019s material. And in terms of the impacts on our business overall and what we\u2019re seeing in that market, I think Tim is best positioned to speak to that.\nTim Turner: Yes, I\u2019d be happy too. The forecast for catastrophic property, a very large part of our property practice group is much hardening. We expect the market going into 2023 to get extremely difficult and hard and the flow of business into our channel to increase substantially. We\u2019re set up to absorb it and capture it. And we\u2019re ready to take on the challenge. But it will be a very big driver of new business for us as we go into 2023.\nElyse Greenspan: And then just maybe one last one. You guys had mentioned that you saw a little bit of a slowdown in flow of business to the E&S market. Was that specific to certain business lines? And would you expect that hurricane Ian and I guess the ramifications on the property market could reverse that?\nTim Turner: We\u2019ve seen a very slight indication of a slowdown in flow into the channel through the last month in the stamping offices, very slight. And the flow remains double-digit, very strong, flowing into our world. So no let-up that we can see in general casualty. And again, property, we\u2019re already seeing signs of the effects of the storm and affirming and an increase in flow here in this quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nWeston Bloomer: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is a follow-up on the organic growth commentary that should be slower in the first half of the year. Are you expecting kind of organic to come in kind of below that double-digit range in the first half? Or could we maybe see an offset from stronger property growth? Just trying to figure out how we should think about the magnitude of flow...\nJeremiah Bickham: Weston, hey, it\u2019s Jeremiah. The same glitches that the operator mentioned at the beginning of Q&A, we\u2019re actually getting on this side, too. So I -- you broke up. Would you mind repeating the question?\nWeston Bloomer: Yes, switching from the headset too. Is this better?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes, so far, so good.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. I was hoping you could comment on kind of the magnitude of the slowdown that you\u2019re expecting in the first half of the year. I know you\u2019ve historically guide to annual double-digit organic growth, but could we potentially see single-digit organic growth in the first half if these trends continue? Or maybe would we see a partial offset from an accelerating property market?\nJeremiah Bickham: Fair question. It is a little bit premature to talk about 2023 guidance. Like we\u2019ll obviously know a lot more when we come back to you in February, Weston. But a couple of points to keep in mind between now and then. And most importantly, our strategy, our thesis, our competitive position, our value-add to our clients, no change there. All of those are very much intact. And rate decline, by the way, which we\u2019re going to talk a lot about -- we talked a lot about in our remarks, specifically in D&O, it\u2019s not our Kryptonite. Like it\u2019s part of life for our company. We\u2019ve managed through it for years and produced double-digit organic growth on an annual basis, year in and year out through that. So, we actually think that this whipsaw in D&O is fairly unique. And we have got this known public headwind, D&O, but we believe that we will cycle through it by the beginning -- I\u2019m sorry, the middle of next year. And we also have macroeconomic factors that play an unknown role in terms of impact and duration. And I think all companies are facing that right now. But as you mentioned, not all the variables in play, especially when we\u2019re talking about next year, are negative. The property market, as Tim said, is expected to get very hard and will be a benefit to us. And as I said, our property book is many multiples of our D&O book. And so we\u2019re not trying to convey concern. As I said, we are still double-digit organic growers on an annual basis. We\u2019re just trying to be transparent that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty out there. It\u2019s difficult to predict all the rates of change that are affecting our industry. And so like always, we have to be prudent with regards to setting expectations, but we\u2019re still very bullish about our long-term growth prospects and the durability of the E&S market overall.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. And a follow-up to that. I know 1Q and 2Q organic outperformed and you had called out in the past kind of some lumpy timing with transactions. How much of that was related to the D&O book and the transaction liability? Is there a way to quantify how much of that outperformed in the first half of the year?\nJeremiah Bickham: Weston, I hope that you can hear us better than we can hear you because we missed the first half of your question.\nWeston Bloomer: The question was really how much of maybe the M&A transaction liability or D&O led to the outperformance in the first half of this year. Is there a way to quantify that?\nJeremiah Bickham: I would say \u2013 I\u2019m going to start, and then Miles Wuller, who\u2019s on the call, who manages our two transaction liability MGUs will speak to some of the trends there. But the bigger theme here is that the surge in D&O happened last year. And so we\u2019re facing an exceptionally difficult comp. And as much \u2013 actually more than it was a contributor to our growth last year; and it was a drag this year. And it actually started modestly at the very, very end of Q2 and we adjusted our expectations for H2 as a result of that, but it accelerated even more than we anticipated. On the M&A side, we didn\u2019t have an outsized H1 that\u2019s now reversing. We had a fairly normal H1 just because despite the fact that there\u2019s been no substantial IPO activity this year and M&A activity, I\u2019m sorry, M&A activity, the impact on closing those deals, the timing of closing those deals didn\u2019t really start affecting us until Q3. And we have to assume because rates don\u2019t appear to be coming down or moderating anytime soon that, that persists at least for the short term. But Miles, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any other color you want to add to that trend.\nMiles Wuller: No, absolutely. I mean we benefit from both the U.S. and international practice within our portfolio. So global M&A is drifting down this year compared to last year as much as 20% to 30% depending on geography. Year-to-date, as a leader, we\u2019ve continued to grow and achieve rate, but I think we\u2019ve rightly flagged here that submissions have started to decline more in the last 90-days, somewhat linked to the recessionary environment, either keeping sellers from bringing new deals to the market or not finding market clearing price on deals. And as both Pat and Tim have highlighted, a reasonably functioning debt capital markets is needed to keep our optimal growth rates up. I\u2019m happy to say we\u2019ve recorded record levels of deals in inventory that are signed and the coverage is accepted. However, the deals are waiting to close as they await financing.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. And last one for me. I know you don\u2019t give organic growth by underwriting practice. I was hoping you could kind of help size the growth you saw across Underwriting, Binding and MGU in the quarter and kind of what your expectations are by each one in the 4Q.\nPat Ryan: Jeremiah, do you want to take that one, then Miles, you can pick up on the Underwriting.\nJeremiah Bickham: So in the queue, Weston you can actually see revenue growth by specialty. We break it out by binding, brokerage and underwriting managers. As we\u2019ve said before, all of these specialties have double-digit growth capabilities. And more often than not, they do. The headwinds we\u2019re talking about them are affecting each of them differently. So the SME market slowdown, that\u2019s mostly a binding specialty effecter. What\u2019s going on in public D&O, that\u2019s hitting brokerage more than the other two specialties and then transaction liability, the majority of the impact there that Miles just talked about, that\u2019s an underwriting managers. So what we\u2019re assuming for Q4 is actually that all the headwinds that we\u2019re experiencing \u2013 we experienced in Q3 not only continue but get a little bit worse.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. \nRob Cox: Hey, I just had a question on supplemental and contingent commissions. I noticed in the 10-Q, they declined 36% year-over-year after growing pretty solidly in 2Q. And I was just wondering what that was driven by and if it was related at all to catastrophe activity in the quarter.\nJeremiah Bickham: You broke up at the end. Did you ask if it was related to Ian?\nRob Cox: Yes.\nJeremiah Bickham: Hello.\nRob Cox: Yes, yes. It\u2019s if it was related to catastrophe activity, yes?\nJeremiah Bickham: The answer is no. It\u2019s really a timing issue more than anything. The effects of Ian won\u2019t show up until down the line, like mostly next year and beyond, although we do expect that impact to be immaterial. The quarter-over-quarter is, as I said, a timing issue. And sometimes, we restructure to often improve our profit commission, our contingent commission arrangements, and we actually restructured a material one this year that altered the timing of what we would normally receive. So no material negative impact on the contingent commission front, specifically related to Ian.\nPat Ryan: Miles, do you want to add anything to...\nMiles Wuller: Well, no, we\u2019re having a strong year for profit commissions year-to-date. And as Jeremiah mentioned, that\u2019s reflective of recent years. Our view on that forward-looking view of Ian actually is we are extremely pleased with our loss results so far. We\u2019re actually, based on claims activity to date and mild results, we\u2019re expecting to dramatically outperform the industry in the end. So we\u2019re counting on that as a future benefit leading into next year.\nTim Turner: And I would add our binding authorities within RT continue to perform exceptionally well. Our contingency forecast remains very strong, and we\u2019re on track. So everything is working out very well in that unit.\nRob Cox: Got it. Thank you. And then was growth impacted at all in the quarter by lower property placements in this quarter versus kind of the first half of the year?\nJeremiah Bickham: I\u2019m sorry to ask you again, it broke up for the first part of your question.\nRob Cox: Yes. Was growth impacted by lower property placements in 3Q versus the first half of the year?\nJeremiah Bickham: No I don\u2019t believe so.\nRob Cox: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your questions.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Good evening. I hope I\u2019m coming through clearly.\nJeremiah Bickham: So far, so good. Fingers crossed.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. All right. Here's hoping Just to follow up on Rob\u2019s question. Did the year-over-year declining contingents; did that impact organic growth in the quarter at all?\nJeremiah Bickham: I only heard the back end of your question, but I think I have picked up the essence. contingent commissions are stripped out of the organic growth calculation. No. So no impact to organic.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. I was hoping \u2013 I guess this is for Tim for a little bit more color on the \u2013 or maybe Miles \u2013 of the impact of personal lines capacity because you would call that out as one of the issues that\u2019s maybe also a bit of a headwind right now?\nTim Turner: Yes. Our personal lines division, a much smaller division within binding was short of some wind and flood capacity that affected their ability to write new business and the competitive landscape prior to Ian. But we\u2019ve remedied that, and we expect it to be \u2013 our capacity to be where it needs to be as we head into the fourth quarter and geared up for 2023. So we\u2019ve fixed that and we expect it to be back to normal capacity.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That is helpful. And then last question, just in terms of overall expectations. Do you see any connection between a weakening economic environment and the incremental competitiveness or deal flow pace? Are those connected at all? Or is that just a function of what\u2019s happening within P&C?\nJeremiah Bickham: I\u2019m sorry, Meyer. Would you repeat? I heard, is there a connection between economic slowdown and the competitiveness and the pace of deal flow. Is that related to risk that need to be placed or like M&A?\nMeyer Shields: So in terms of risk that needs to be placed. We are seeing less business go to the specialty channel as a consequence of the potential economic slowdown? Or do you see that as separate and just coinciding right now?\nTim Turner: We really see that as separate and have not identified any impact on flow. As we said, the top stamping office results that have come in, in the last couple of months showed a very, very slight deceleration, hardly detectable, still double digit, very strong flow coming into the non-admitted space.\nMeyer Shields: All right. Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. \nTracy Benguigui: You took up the lower end of your EBITDAC margin guide by 50 basis points, with lower top line growth, what is driving that? Are you focusing more on expense savings now that you\u2019re seeing the top line growth pressure?\nJeremiah Bickham: We\u2019re always focused on managing to the bottom line, Tracy. And 50 basis points may seem tight, but it represents a decent amount of variability given that we only have two months left in the year. We are definitely making investment in hiring decisions in the context of top line expectations. We haven\u2019t spent as much on new talent acquisition as we thought we potentially could in the beginning of the year. And quite frankly, investment income has been a little bit higher than we expected. But we have a pretty good sense of where we\u2019re going to end the year given that it\u2019s already November 10.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. And then on the D&O, I\u2019m just wondering, were there any programs that may be you\u2019re no longer a part of. So it\u2019s not the pressures we\u2019re seeing on pricing with maybe something more specific to your business?\nMiles Wuller: I\u2019ll respond from the Underwriting Managers. We\u2019ve kept all of our facilities intact. We\u2019ve delivered great results to our carriers. We actually grew our capacity last year. And so no, there\u2019s nothing unique to us. We have the capacity, the capability. It\u2019s just an overall pullback in the marketplace, and we\u2019re not going to chase it.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, so first on just your organic growth, I think you\u2019re implying that growth slowed as the quarter \u2013 as you went through the third quarter. Can you maybe quantify or just give us a better idea on what the actual growth was early in the quarter versus late in the quarter and so we get a better sense of how 4Q is looking.\nJeremiah Bickham: Well, we are definitely not going to break out growth by month. But given that it is November 10 already, we\u2019re taking everything we\u2019ve seen through today into account with our Q4 outlook for sure. And as I said, Jimmy, we are assuming that all the things that slowed us down in Q3 persist and actually accelerate. It\u2019s really difficult to predict where a rate of change actually inflects. But we\u2019re sticking to our MO of being as prudent and transparent as we can.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then if you think about the overall E&S market and your business, obviously, it\u2019s grown a lot faster than the standard market and partly because the exposures have been coming into the E&S market. Do you think at all if pricing in the primary market sort of slows down a little bit or flattens out. Would that affect the flow of business into E&S in the short term? Like with some of the business that\u2019s come into E&S, could that end up going back to standard lines even if the \u2013 in the short term, even if the long-term growth outlook for the market is good.\nTim Turner: I\u2019m not sure I fully understood the question, but I think, what you\u2019re asking is would that have any impact on the flow into the non-admitted business?\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes, exactly.\nTim Turner: Yes. I don\u2019t believe so. I believe that the losses coming from social inflation and global warming continue to impact the balance sheets of the standard markets and they\u2019re continually de-risking their portfolios directly affecting that heavy flow into our channel.\nPat Ryan: Jimmy, with your question, I think it\u2019s appropriate. This is Pat. Miles talk about Cyber because Cyber needs to be explained in terms of some really good news for the industry and for commerce in general. So Miles, why don\u2019t you explain this Cyber?\nMiles Wuller: Yes, absolutely. So dovetailing your question, Jimmy. I mean, using Cyber as an example. Last year, the U.S. Cyber market actually doubled and E&S met that need by growing at 220% relative to only 20% growth in the admitted market. So 2022 might not be as dramatic, but E&S will continue to lead the way. Why is this even more relevant in this class? Well, despite a doubling of growth in the market, we still believe that only 90% - excuse me, as much as 90% of the Cyber market remains uninsured today. So there\u2019s a huge runway for us to pursue regardless of short-term pricing trends. But as it relates to pricing exactly, so we are monitoring it closely. There is some flattening underway. Again, another class we\u2019ve benefit is from the hard market dynamics. Our underwriting has enabled us to grow our facilities both in limit and total premium available to write on delegate basis. But within the market, companies have invested in risk management and loss control, resulting in improving loss trends. Risk premium related to the Ukraine war is slowly leaking out of the market as there hasn\u2019t been an associated shock loss to date. And so ultimately, we are seeing a stabilizing environment where rate adequacy has improved and there is an increase in carrier competition but that doesn\u2019t change our overall view that we\u2019re in the early stages of penetrating this addressable market.\nJimmy Bhullar: Sure. And lastly, just in terms of growth versus margins, I think versus many of the retail brokers and some of the more mature companies, you have had a preference for investing in the business while you were growing very fast. So I think margins haven\u2019t expanded as much as they normally would have expanded given your significant growth. But should we assume a change in focus in terms of growth spending if revenue growth slows down? Or is \u2013 are you going to be consistent with how you\u2019ve been in the past in terms of sort of investing in the business?\nJeremiah Bickham: Hi Jimmy, we\u2019re going to \u2013 the short answer is we\u2019re going to stick to our game plan, which is balancing, making necessary investments to continue outsized organic growth. While managing margin and growing it over time. It doesn\u2019t mean every quarter. It won\u2019t even mean every year necessarily, but what we\u2019re on record for shooting for here is that most years on a reported basis, we are going to show scaling in margin. And as I said in answering Tracy\u2019s question, just with our lower growth in Q3 and our expected lower growth in Q4, we\u2019re already beginning to adapt. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve got practice adapting and being flexible. And we\u2019re fortunate because for starters, a huge amount of our cost base is variable to begin with. So we\u2019re going to stick to our plan.\nPat Ryan: One last comment by Miles.\nMiles Wuller: Yes. And Jimmy, just to be fulsome on Cyber as an example, it is hardest to place commercial business. A lot of that is \u2013 the growth continues in E&S. However, in some of the small and medium business, there is increasing competition that the admitted lines can solve for in some cases. So there might start to be fraying in that end of the market.\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes and then Cyber is understandable because it\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s way more demand than there is supply of capital to cover the risk. But how \u2013 but it\u2019s a pretty small market, right? Cyber is like 2% of the market for the primary companies. Is it a lot larger than that for you guys?\nMiles Wuller: Well, back to Jeremiah\u2019s response. We have the benefit of 23 MGUs in the family in the National Programs unit with 17 niches. So we\u2019re not dependent on any particular product within the family. But we feel we have a material practice with a lot of upside in addressing the market.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nMiles Wuller: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please proceed with your questions.\nMike Zaremski: Hey good evening. Questions on cash flows from operations. I know there\u2019s noise in this that we need to back out. But curious if there\u2019s anything you want to call out on the call? Or should we be thinking that cash flow from operations grows on a full year basis or especially into 2023.\nJeremiah Bickham: So thank you for bringing that up, Mike. This quarter is the perfect example why we guide people towards our adjusted view of cash flow. Operating cash flow this quarter was impacted significantly by a 100 \u2013 a 9-figure payment to finish out the all-risk LTIP plan, which, by the way, are earn-outs essentially they\u2019re purchase price reductions, but because they\u2019re paid to employees, non-equity holders, GAAP forces you to run that through the P&L as comp. And we absolutely love that because it\u2019s sticky, and it makes a lot of new family members happy. So this concept is not going away. We\u2019re going to put these in as many deals as we can. But it\u2019s a great example of why a traditional view of operating cash flow is going to have noise in us for quite some time.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And just curious, I know it\u2019s early days in terms of higher interest rates, but is \u2013 do you see that impacting the M&A marketplace in terms of deals and competition for deals you guys are looking at or not really yet?\nPat Ryan: We have a very robust pipeline both in brokerage, managing underwriting and benefits. As we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been very disciplined and not reacting to just doing a deal. So we\u2019ve done a lot of \u2013 have had a lot of discussions. We have some people we\u2019re in significant discussion with and quite strategic opportunities. So we\u2019re bullish on our M&A activity, but we won\u2019t close anything this calendar year, but we\u2019re in a good position to bring in strategic opportunities next year. And the market has still been robust in terms of multiples. And so we\u2019ve avoided what we consider to be excess multiples in terms of valuation. And as I said, we look at the culture and the strategy and the accretion. But also we look at the impact we can have on our total enterprise by bringing these companies in. And so we\u2019ll look at valuation and say what kind of cost synergies are there that are material. We never price in the value of revenue synergies. But our revenue synergies have historically been very significant. If you take the All Risks acquisition. They have outperformed our expectations in terms of the brokers productivity increases. So synergy on revenue is something that we look for as we value our potential opportunity, but we don\u2019t pay for that.\nJeremiah Bickham: And Mike, to the part of your question related to firepower and how that positions us versus other would-be bidders. We actually feel like we\u2019re in a great spot because we raised our bond in January. And I\u2019m sure you saw we\u2019ve got over $800 million of cash on the balance sheet. We have an undrawn - $600 million undrawn revolver, we\u2019re levered at less than 2.5times net. So it\u2019s not as important for like tuck-in deals. But if we\u2019re competing on a large property and our competition has to go raise new capital, like that is going to be an advantage for us. We\u2019re really fortunate that we could take down big targets right now without raising new capital. As Pat said, it hasn\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen a huge impact in multiples yet. But for big deals, we think it could give us edge.\nPat Ryan: I\u2019d like to just say one [indiscernible], one of my comment. It\u2019s possible that we could close the deal before year-end. Here we are almost in November. So I am not forecasting that, but we have some attractive opportunities.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, there are no additional questions. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat Ryan for closing remarks.\nPat Ryan: Thank you all for your continued interest and support of Ryan Specialty. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the next few days, but we particularly look forward to discussing our fourth quarter 2022 results. Thanks for your support and your interest.\nOperator: This will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Jeremiah Bickham",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. In Q3, we grew total revenue 16.8% period-over-period to $412 million, which was fueled by another solid quarter of organic revenue growth at 13.7%, reflecting the ongoing tailwinds in most of the E&S market and continuing to win a substantial amount of new business despite the nearly 29% year-over-year comp. Net income for Q3 2022 was $29 million or $0.09 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO-related and other unusual items, increased 6% period-over-period to $67 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the third quarter grew 11% period-over-period to $117 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 140 basis points to 28.4%. Our adjusted EBITDAC margin was impacted by continued investments in the business and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels and also improved by higher fiduciary income. It should be noted that relative to Q3 of 2019, which had a full run rate of T&E, our margin was up 450 basis points in the quarter, again, showing the proven scalability of our model over the years. Moving forward, we will prudently continue our hiring practice of finding the industry's top talent in both underwriting and broking where there are clear opportunities to grow lines of business. We also fully intend to continue investing in our platform, which allows us to generate sustainable margins while producing industry-leading organic revenue growth. As we do so, we will continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and industry for additional signs of slowing to ensure that our investments in talent and infrastructure are accretive. Furthermore, our balance sheet remains fortified with $833 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, in addition to our $600 million of undrawn revolving credit facilities. To that end, it has always been important to us to maintain a strong financial position. I want to highlight our timely capital raise at the beginning of this year before the cycle of steep rate hikes began, which diversified our funding sources. We expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds and includes amortization on our interest rate cap of approximately $31 million for Q4 2022. And for the first time, we are beginning to receive payments under our interest rate cap. Again, it is important to be mindful that the impact of increased interest expense is mitigated by the natural hedge on our fiduciary balances, which benefit from the rising rate environment. These fiduciary balances continue to generate fiduciary investment income at approximately one month term SOFR, less approximately 50 basis points. This spread to SOFR factors in earnings yield that may lag the forward curve as well as some fiduciary balances, which are not permitted to earn yield or that earn soft yield that is instead an offset to our bank fees and SG&A expense. Additionally, it is important for us to note that given the timing of our M&A pipeline, it is unlikely that we will close a sizable deal in Q4. But as Pat mentioned, our M&A pipeline remains robust, and we remain disciplined in our approach. Taking a step back, through our first nine months, we generated exceptional organic growth and healthy adjusted EBITDAC margin. As Pat and Tim mentioned, the long-term Ryan story remains very much intact. However, given current headwinds in public company D&O and macroeconomic headwinds impacting construction starts and M&A transaction liability activity, we are lowering our full year 2022 guidance for organic revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.0% from the previous guide range of 16.5% to 18.0%. This implies a mid-single-digit midpoint for organic revenue growth in Q4. This guide range is ahead of where our expectations were for full year 2022 at the beginning of the year when it was difficult to predict the timing and degree of these market changes and macroeconomic impacts. In addition, we are now guiding our adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year 2022 to be between 29.5% and 30.0% from the previous guide range of 29.0% to 30.0%. In summary, we remain very pleased with our performance year-to-date and are focused on the path ahead as we navigate through the coming economic cycle. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Elyse, thank you for your question. So we are, in fact, still double-digit growers on an annual basis. We are talking about Q4. And like we've said in the quarters of 20% plus growth, you can't look at any quarter up or down and extrapolate a trend. To your question about concentration, I can say that no single product line, including public D&O, is even 10% of our overall book. We have a very overall well-diversified portfolio of products and specialties. It's just last year, public D&O specifically, had an outsized growth contribution. And this quarter, it actually shrank dramatically. So it went from being a contributor to a drag on our organic. But we are confident that D&O in our entire professional lines practice is one that we're very strong in and that we can continue to grow long term. So in terms of the property exposure, well, I want to say, be careful and not use exposure and insinuate underwriting risk exposure. The percentage of our book that is related to property is many, many multiples of our D&O book. We don't disclose the exact percentage, but it's material. And in terms of the impacts on our business overall and what we're seeing in that market, I think Tim is best positioned to speak to that. Weston, hey, it's Jeremiah. The same glitches that the operator mentioned at the beginning of Q&A, we're actually getting on this side, too. So I -- you broke up. Would you mind repeating the question? Yes, so far, so good. Fair question. It is a little bit premature to talk about 2023 guidance. Like we'll obviously know a lot more when we come back to you in February, Weston. But a couple of points to keep in mind between now and then. And most importantly, our strategy, our thesis, our competitive position, our value-add to our clients, no change there. All of those are very much intact. And rate decline, by the way, which we're going to talk a lot about -- we talked a lot about in our remarks, specifically in D&O, it's not our Kryptonite. Like it's part of life for our company. We've managed through it for years and produced double-digit organic growth on an annual basis, year in and year out through that. So, we actually think that this whipsaw in D&O is fairly unique. And we have got this known public headwind, D&O, but we believe that we will cycle through it by the beginning -- I'm sorry, the middle of next year. And we also have macroeconomic factors that play an unknown role in terms of impact and duration. And I think all companies are facing that right now. But as you mentioned, not all the variables in play, especially when we're talking about next year, are negative. The property market, as Tim said, is expected to get very hard and will be a benefit to us. And as I said, our property book is many multiples of our D&O book. And so we're not trying to convey concern. As I said, we are still double-digit organic growers on an annual basis. We're just trying to be transparent that there's a lot of uncertainty out there. It's difficult to predict all the rates of change that are affecting our industry. And so like always, we have to be prudent with regards to setting expectations, but we're still very bullish about our long-term growth prospects and the durability of the E&S market overall. Weston, I hope that you can hear us better than we can hear you because we missed the first half of your question. I would say \u2013 I'm going to start, and then Miles Wuller, who's on the call, who manages our two transaction liability MGUs will speak to some of the trends there. But the bigger theme here is that the surge in D&O happened last year. And so we're facing an exceptionally difficult comp. And as much \u2013 actually more than it was a contributor to our growth last year; and it was a drag this year. And it actually started modestly at the very, very end of Q2 and we adjusted our expectations for H2 as a result of that, but it accelerated even more than we anticipated. On the M&A side, we didn't have an outsized H1 that's now reversing. We had a fairly normal H1 just because despite the fact that there's been no substantial IPO activity this year and M&A activity, I'm sorry, M&A activity, the impact on closing those deals, the timing of closing those deals didn't really start affecting us until Q3. And we have to assume because rates don't appear to be coming down or moderating anytime soon that, that persists at least for the short term. But Miles, I don't know if there's any other color you want to add to that trend. So in the queue, Weston you can actually see revenue growth by specialty. We break it out by binding, brokerage and underwriting managers. As we've said before, all of these specialties have double-digit growth capabilities. And more often than not, they do. The headwinds we're talking about them are affecting each of them differently. So the SME market slowdown, that's mostly a binding specialty effecter. What's going on in public D&O, that's hitting brokerage more than the other two specialties and then transaction liability, the majority of the impact there that Miles just talked about, that's an underwriting managers. So what we're assuming for Q4 is actually that all the headwinds that we're experiencing \u2013 we experienced in Q3 not only continue but get a little bit worse. You broke up at the end. Did you ask if it was related to Ian? Hello. The answer is no. It's really a timing issue more than anything. The effects of Ian won't show up until down the line, like mostly next year and beyond, although we do expect that impact to be immaterial. The quarter-over-quarter is, as I said, a timing issue. And sometimes, we restructure to often improve our profit commission, our contingent commission arrangements, and we actually restructured a material one this year that altered the timing of what we would normally receive. So no material negative impact on the contingent commission front, specifically related to Ian. I'm sorry to ask you again, it broke up for the first part of your question. No I don't believe so. So far, so good. Fingers crossed. I only heard the back end of your question, but I think I have picked up the essence. contingent commissions are stripped out of the organic growth calculation. No. So no impact to organic. I'm sorry, Meyer. Would you repeat? I heard, is there a connection between economic slowdown and the competitiveness and the pace of deal flow. Is that related to risk that need to be placed or like M&A? We're always focused on managing to the bottom line, Tracy. And 50 basis points may seem tight, but it represents a decent amount of variability given that we only have two months left in the year. We are definitely making investment in hiring decisions in the context of top line expectations. We haven't spent as much on new talent acquisition as we thought we potentially could in the beginning of the year. And quite frankly, investment income has been a little bit higher than we expected. But we have a pretty good sense of where we're going to end the year given that it's already November 10. Well, we are definitely not going to break out growth by month. But given that it is November 10 already, we're taking everything we've seen through today into account with our Q4 outlook for sure. And as I said, Jimmy, we are assuming that all the things that slowed us down in Q3 persist and actually accelerate. It's really difficult to predict where a rate of change actually inflects. But we're sticking to our MO of being as prudent and transparent as we can. Hi Jimmy, we're going to \u2013 the short answer is we're going to stick to our game plan, which is balancing, making necessary investments to continue outsized organic growth. While managing margin and growing it over time. It doesn't mean every quarter. It won't even mean every year necessarily, but what we're on record for shooting for here is that most years on a reported basis, we are going to show scaling in margin. And as I said in answering Tracy's question, just with our lower growth in Q3 and our expected lower growth in Q4, we're already beginning to adapt. Unfortunately, we've got practice adapting and being flexible. And we're fortunate because for starters, a huge amount of our cost base is variable to begin with. So we're going to stick to our plan. So thank you for bringing that up, Mike. This quarter is the perfect example why we guide people towards our adjusted view of cash flow. Operating cash flow this quarter was impacted significantly by a 100 \u2013 a 9-figure payment to finish out the all-risk LTIP plan, which, by the way, are earn-outs essentially they're purchase price reductions, but because they're paid to employees, non-equity holders, GAAP forces you to run that through the P&L as comp. And we absolutely love that because it's sticky, and it makes a lot of new family members happy. So this concept is not going away. We're going to put these in as many deals as we can.

            "name": "Pat Ryan",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. Joining us on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; and our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham. Also joining is Miles Wuller, CEO of our Underwriting Managers Specialty who will be around for the Q&A. It was a solid quarter for Ryan Specialty and our differentiated platform. Total revenue grew 16.8%, led by 13.7% organic growth. In addition, we achieved double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and solid growth in adjusted net income. Specific to the third quarter, our hard market for rates largely continued, and we saw additional firming in many of our lines of business. As we noted last quarter, one notable exception was public company D&O, which saw a rapid rate decline in the quarter beyond what we and the market anticipated and which Tim will touch upon shortly. Importantly, our ability to generate another quarter of double-digit organic growth despite this headwind and the exceptional third quarter 2021 comp speaks volumes about the strength of our team, our diverse product and services offering and the winning culture we have built at Ryan Specialty. As we've noted previously, risks across industries are only becoming more complex. Our products are largely compulsory and our clients value the expertise we bring. Our producers continue to provide our clients and our trading partners with innovative solutions, but we want to acknowledge that the increasingly challenging insurance and macroeconomic environment in specifically three areas where we are seeing headwinds that will likely carry into at least the first half of 2023. First, while the E&S marketplace remains a standout within the insurance industry, we began to see a deceleration in the growth rate of inbound flow towards the end of the quarter, which is backed by state stamping reports. Second, a faster-than-anticipated economic deceleration coupled with significantly higher interest rates are delaying certain project-based construction policies, along with M&A transaction liability policies that rely on highly functioning debt markets. Third, changing market conditions in the public D&O market have had an impact on our professional lines book. After years of rate hardening, new capacity entered the market leading to additional supply and a decrease in rate at a time when IPO activity is down significantly. This has also led to increased opportunities for retail brokers to place some of this business directly. Our collective experience has allowed us to successfully manage through different economic cycles in the past. And we are confident that our leadership team is well positioned to execute our game plan through the cycle as well. We are also pleased to note that productivity among our brokers continues to improve, a testament to their tireless efforts to be laser-focused on client centricity and to match market needs with industry-leading expertise. We are also prudently continuing to onboard top decile talent to add to our industry-leading team and deep bench to take advantage of the resilient E&S flow and continue gaining market share. Additionally, our M&A pipeline remains robust as we look for additional opportunities, both tuck-ins and larger acquisitions to enhance and differentiate our platform and capabilities. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions, particularly in the current environment as we will only move forward when all our criteria are met. Every acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. Our discipline is bolstered by our core results, which have proven throughout this year that we do not require acquisitions to achieve robust growth in any given period. As we begin to turn the page on 2022, we believe we remain well positioned to succeed over the long term given our resilient and flexible operating model that enables us to quickly adapt and pivot to an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment. We nonetheless remain confident that the value we bring to our trading partners, particularly in times of uncertainty remains extremely valuable as we anticipate their needs and work tirelessly to provide the right solutions to protect their insurance risks. As it has in the past, we expect the E&S market will continue to grow as the world becomes riskier and more complex. This, along with other secular growth drivers, should allow us to generate annual double-digit organic growth for years to come. In summary, I remain proud of our entire team at Ryan Specialty as their incredible effort led to another solid quarter and 2022 will surpass our expectations from when we started the year. Now, I'll turn it over to Tim. Tim? Jeremiah, do you want to take that one, then Miles, you can pick up on the Underwriting. Miles, do you want to add anything to... Jimmy, with your question, I think it's appropriate. This is Pat. Miles talk about Cyber because Cyber needs to be explained in terms of some really good news for the industry and for commerce in general. So Miles, why don't you explain this Cyber? One last comment by Miles. We have a very robust pipeline both in brokerage, managing underwriting and benefits. As we've said, we've been very disciplined and not reacting to just doing a deal. So we've done a lot of \u2013 have had a lot of discussions. We have some people we're in significant discussion with and quite strategic opportunities. So we're bullish on our M&A activity, but we won't close anything this calendar year, but we're in a good position to bring in strategic opportunities next year. And the market has still been robust in terms of multiples. And so we've avoided what we consider to be excess multiples in terms of valuation. And as I said, we look at the culture and the strategy and the accretion. But also we look at the impact we can have on our total enterprise by bringing these companies in. And so we'll look at valuation and say what kind of cost synergies are there that are material. We never price in the value of revenue synergies. But our revenue synergies have historically been very significant. If you take the All Risks acquisition. They have outperformed our expectations in terms of the brokers productivity increases. So synergy on revenue is something that we look for as we value our potential opportunity, but we don't pay for that. I'd like to just say one [indiscernible], one of my comment. It's possible that we could close the deal before year-end. Here we are almost in November. So I am not forecasting that, but we have some attractive opportunities. Thank you all for your continued interest and support of Ryan Specialty. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the next few days, but we particularly look forward to discussing our fourth quarter 2022 results. Thanks for your support and your interest."

            "name": "Miles Wuller",
            "content": "No, absolutely. I mean we benefit from both the U.S. and international practice within our portfolio. So global M&A is drifting down this year compared to last year as much as 20% to 30% depending on geography. Year-to-date, as a leader, we've continued to grow and achieve rate, but I think we've rightly flagged here that submissions have started to decline more in the last 90-days, somewhat linked to the recessionary environment, either keeping sellers from bringing new deals to the market or not finding market clearing price on deals. And as both Pat and Tim have highlighted, a reasonably functioning debt capital markets is needed to keep our optimal growth rates up. I'm happy to say we've recorded record levels of deals in inventory that are signed and the coverage is accepted. However, the deals are waiting to close as they await financing. Well, no, we're having a strong year for profit commissions year-to-date. And as Jeremiah mentioned, that's reflective of recent years. Our view on that forward-looking view of Ian actually is we are extremely pleased with our loss results so far. We're actually, based on claims activity to date and mild results, we're expecting to dramatically outperform the industry in the end. So we're counting on that as a future benefit leading into next year. I'll respond from the Underwriting Managers. We've kept all of our facilities intact. We've delivered great results to our carriers. We actually grew our capacity last year. And so no, there's nothing unique to us. We have the capacity, the capability. It's just an overall pullback in the marketplace, and we're not going to chase it. Yes, absolutely. So dovetailing your question, Jimmy. I mean, using Cyber as an example. Last year, the U.S. Cyber market actually doubled and E&S met that need by growing at 220% relative to only 20% growth in the admitted market. So 2022 might not be as dramatic, but E&S will continue to lead the way. Why is this even more relevant in this class? Well, despite a doubling of growth in the market, we still believe that only 90% - excuse me, as much as 90% of the Cyber market remains uninsured today. So there's a huge runway for us to pursue regardless of short-term pricing trends. But as it relates to pricing exactly, so we are monitoring it closely. There is some flattening underway. Again, another class we've benefit is from the hard market dynamics. Our underwriting has enabled us to grow our facilities both in limit and total premium available to write on delegate basis. But within the market, companies have invested in risk management and loss control, resulting in improving loss trends. Risk premium related to the Ukraine war is slowly leaking out of the market as there hasn't been an associated shock loss to date. And so ultimately, we are seeing a stabilizing environment where rate adequacy has improved and there is an increase in carrier competition but that doesn't change our overall view that we're in the early stages of penetrating this addressable market. Yes. And Jimmy, just to be fulsome on Cyber as an example, it is hardest to place commercial business. A lot of that is \u2013 the growth continues in E&S. However, in some of the small and medium business, there is increasing competition that the admitted lines can solve for in some cases. So there might start to be fraying in that end of the market. Well, back to Jeremiah's response. We have the benefit of 23 MGUs in the family in the National Programs unit with 17 niches. So we're not dependent on any particular product within the family. But we feel we have a material practice with a lot of upside in addressing the market. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. As Pat highlighted, it was another solid quarter across our specialties, and the E&S market continues to serve a critical role in an increasingly challenging insurance landscape. This is backed up by A.M. BEST's recent report, which highlighted the sustained expansion and rise in demand for E&S solutions driven by constantly evolving risks and rapidly innovating technology. We are in a prime position to continue to capitalize on these positive trends. Diving into our specialties, our wholesale brokerage specialty achieved another quarter of strong growth across property and casualty lines of business. Once again, CAT property was the strongest driver of new business into the non-admitted market. Since our last call, Hurricane Ian, a devastating storm caused tens of billions of dollars of damage. I would like to take a minute to send our best wishes to all of those that were impacted by this horrible disaster. We believe these types of loss events along with themes we've previously discussed are leading to shrinking capacity as well as even higher rates. Ultimately, we believe these factors will lead to more flow into the E&S market as reinsurers further de-risk their portfolios during upcoming renewal cycles. We also expect increased flow from other non-CAT markets. There will be a significant need for E&S solutions in 2023, and our depth and breadth of experience and products will remain in high demand. We will continue to develop innovative solutions in our brokerage and delegated underwriting authority businesses in these high-hazard niches in order to take advantage of these incoming opportunities. Cyber was a strong performer in the quarter. Flow continued to be robust into the E&S channel. As noted previously, we complement our brokers with capacity from our delegated underwriting authorities as evidenced by our announcement of a new $15 million exclusive excess cyber facility supported by highly rated carriers. It's another example of our brokers innovating on behalf of their clients as well as a staying power our delegated authority demonstrates and how it continues to be a top choice for carrier capital. Our transportation practice, particularly in trucking, continues to see sizable flows. We continue to win business in this line and remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities. Our construction practice performed well in the quarter. We are encouraged by the submissions that we're seeing in the current pipeline of projects. However, we should note that we've begun to observe delayed project starts due to the rapid increase in interest rates and a slowdown in the economy. As Pat noted, our public company D&O practice experienced some headwinds in the quarter as well. As we noted on our prior call, we began to see rate decreases in public company D&O during the second quarter. In the third quarter, the pace of rate decreases in that line accelerated. This and the market forces that Pat referenced are what we began to observe earlier this year and have referenced in prior calls. These had a significant mitigating impact on the strong growth in our other lines. We expect these trends in public company D&O to continue into at least mid-2023. However, we are confident that we have the team and platform in place to continue to grow in this line over the long term. In our Binding Authority specialty, we saw solid growth in traditional binding, which includes small commercial business that has historically been economically sensitive. This growth was reduced by our personal lines Binding Authority, which has experienced capacity constraints, an area of focus for our upcoming carrier renewals. Additionally, the panel consolidation opportunity that we've mentioned for a number of quarters is just beginning to bear fruit. We see this as a long and steady growth opportunity and we are well positioned to execute. Our Underwriting Management specialty posted another strong quarter despite dislocated debt capital markets and less M&A activity, resulting in less transactional liability business being bound while continuing to deliver solid underwriting results for our carrier trading partners. We are also seeing continued progress with our de novos through our Harleysville of New York arrangement with Nationwide. In terms of the E&S market, pricing remains firm in many classes of business, with the notable exception of public company D&O rates that Pat mentioned earlier and Cyber, where we are seeing a flattening in rate. As we've said several times before, we expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth opportunity, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our third quarter. Thank you. Yes, I'd be happy too. The forecast for catastrophic property, a very large part of our property practice group is much hardening. We expect the market going into 2023 to get extremely difficult and hard and the flow of business into our channel to increase substantially. We're set up to absorb it and capture it. And we're ready to take on the challenge. But it will be a very big driver of new business for us as we go into 2023. We've seen a very slight indication of a slowdown in flow into the channel through the last month in the stamping offices, very slight. And the flow remains double-digit, very strong, flowing into our world. So no let-up that we can see in general casualty. And again, property, we're already seeing signs of the effects of the storm and affirming and an increase in flow here in this quarter. And I would add our binding authorities within RT continue to perform exceptionally well. Our contingency forecast remains very strong, and we're on track. So everything is working out very well in that unit. Yes. Our personal lines division, a much smaller division within binding was short of some wind and flood capacity that affected their ability to write new business and the competitive landscape prior to Ian. But we've remedied that, and we expect it to be \u2013 our capacity to be where it needs to be as we head into the fourth quarter and geared up for 2023. So we've fixed that and we expect it to be back to normal capacity. We really see that as separate and have not identified any impact on flow. As we said, the top stamping office results that have come in, in the last couple of months showed a very, very slight deceleration, hardly detectable, still double digit, very strong flow coming into the non-admitted space. I'm not sure I fully understood the question, but I think, what you're asking is would that have any impact on the flow into the non-admitted business? Yes. I don't believe so. I believe that the losses coming from social inflation and global warming continue to impact the balance sheets of the standard markets and they're continually de-risking their portfolios directly affecting that heavy flow into our channel."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Noah Angeletti, Head of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nNoah Angeletti: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Ryan Specialty Holdings second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. In addition to this call, we filed a press release with the SEC earlier this afternoon, which has been posted to our website at ryansg.com. On today's call, management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. We encourage listeners to review the more detailed discussion of these risk factors contained in the company's filings with the SEC. We assume no duty to update such forward-looking statements in the future except as required by law. Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP are included in our earnings release, which is filed with the SEC and available on the company's website. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryan Specialty, Pat Ryan.\nPat Ryan : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. Before diving into the quarter, I want to acknowledge the team's efforts since we went public one year ago. I am pleased with our strong results, and we continue to have a long runway ahead of us. We remain true to our values are well-positioned to sustainably and profitably grow our business and believe that we will continue delivering long-term value for our shareholders. I'm also incredibly proud of our frontline. The producers, the underwriters and their teams who are out competing and winning head-to-head in the field by innovating with new products and solutions unrelenting in the pursuit of excellence and winning a substantial amount of new business. Our performance in the second quarter again, demonstrated the strength of our business continuing the track record of success, we've established over the past 11 years, we grew total revenue 26% led by outstanding organic revenue growth of 22%. We also achieved another quarter of double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. Our three specialties all performed very well, each generating strong double-digit growth for the quarter. Overall, I'm immensely pleased with our differentiated platform, which continues to prove that it's truly best-in-class, providing our clients and trading partners with the value and service they deserve. Throughout the second quarter, the E&S marketplace remained robust. In fact, the overall flow of business into our E&S lines is still at historically high levels. As we previously noted, we've invested significantly in those lines, where we see clear opportunities to grow in addition to bolstering the lines of business, where we have a leadership position. Through Q2, we remain in the prolonged stages of historically hard market. Broadly speaking, rates remained firm nearly all of our lines of business, or rates moderated in certain lines. We saw continued upward rate movement in other lines. In addition to the standard or a bit of a carrier competition, we observed on the periphery and which we flagged in prior earnings calls has yet to meaningfully impact rate or flow in the aggregate. We continue to invest in our intellectual capital throughout the quarter, adding to our already strong team and deep bench, and again, proving out that we are a destination of choice for the best talent in the industry. Here are a few of the many examples. We've added accomplished teammates within our renewable energy line and to our data and analytics and technology teams. We are also making significant valuable additions in many of our lines of business expanding new industry verticals. And the exceptional talent we've assembled since our founding, including recent additions over the last year has been hard at work developing new programs and introducing new products in our MGAs and MGUs, bringing new and existing capital in addition to arranging alternative capital to support our clients. We are also pleased to note that productivity among our brokers continues to improve and accelerate and is reflected in our strong Q2 earnings performance. This September will mark the two-year anniversary of our acquisition of All Risks, which has exceeded our expectations in all facets. All Risks is further proof that our business model provides a powerful platform for those looking to join Ryan Specialty, and validates our M&A thesis that we make strong businesses even better. As we look ahead to the rest of 2022, we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and in the geopolitical environment. That said, we believe we remain well-positioned and expect favorable specialty insurance market dynamics to persist. We also continue to invest in our various strategies to take advantage of the resilient, increasing flow into the E&S market and further expand our market share by building what we believe to be the most differentiated platform and deep expansion in the industry. We have benefited from a flight to quality and believe we have positioned ourselves to outperform our competition through the cycle. Moreover, we maintain a highly active M&A pipeline as we look for additional opportunities both tuck-ins and large acquisitions to enhance and differentiate our platform and capabilities. We are working from a position of strength given our strong balance sheet and ample capacity, which enables us to act when we find the right opportunities. As I've said before, we remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions. Any deal we consider must meet our criteria; a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive to our returns. Our M&A strategy is and will remain supplemental to our organic growth story. We are not a roll-up and we do not require acquisitions to achieve our growth targets. In summary it was another team effort at Ryan Specialty that contributed to a fantastic second quarter and first half of 2022. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President, Tim Turner. Tim?\nTim Turner: Thank you very much Pat. As Pat highlighted, it was another outstanding quarter across all three of our specialties. In May for the first time in three years, we hosted our annual Ryan Specialty Broker and Underwriting Management conferences with over 800 of our teammates in attendance. It was incredibly exciting to bring the team together again. The event led by Pat and myself exemplified our culture of collaboration and you could feel the tremendous energy generated by the many talented and driven underwriters, producers and corporate leaders all in one place. Diving into our specialties, our wholesale brokerage specialty continued to achieve excellent growth across all property and casualty lines of business. In particular, cat property including wind, flood and fire has been the strongest driver of new business into the non-admitted market today and an absolute stalwart for us. As we noted on our last call, admitted markets faced pressure from reinsurers derisking their portfolios, which pushes more business into the E&S market. During the quarter, we saw an acceleration of this trend driven by one of the most challenging, reinsurance renewal cycles in a number of years. To that end, we've continued to develop innovative products and solutions in our brokerage MGA and MGU business in these high-hazard niches. Cyber continues to grow in importance due to its complexity. We believe the majority of cyber risks in America will flow into the E&S channel. We are seeing solid double-digit increases in submissions and expect that to continue. We complement our brokers with capacity from our cyber MGAs and MGUs. Construction is another class where we continue to see significant increases in flow. Our industry leading team with its depth and breadth in the channel is seeing solid double-digit increases in submissions for both infrastructure, projects and habitational construction. We don't see this slowing down and the pipeline for these classes remains at historic highs. Our transportation practice continues to grow nicely. Trucking in particular has remained very challenging and the class of business is very risky. And as a result that business is increasingly being directed into the E&S market. We added Crouse and Associates at the perfect time, and we remain well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this line. Our healthcare practice continues to grow with the addition of wholesale brokers and the development of products in our delegated underwriting authority specialties. In our Binding Authority specialty, we continue to experience solid growth in our small commercial lines. We have made additional progress hiring industry leading talent and we expect to continue to invest significantly in the specialty to drive organic growth. We are keeping a close eye on opportunities in the delegated authority market to consolidate into Ryan Specialty and we continue on the path toward creating the first truly 50-state Binding Authority operation. Our Underwriting Management specialty posted another strong quarter, while continuing to deliver solid underwriting results for our carrier trading partners. We are excited by the recent additions to our renewable energy MGU and the recent launch of new products. In addition, our Harleysville New York arrangement with Nationwide is beginning to bear fruit. AXSAL, our alternative risk de novo MGU and Emerald, our excess general liability MGU are both gaining traction and actively quoting and binding accounts. In terms of the E&S market, as Pat mentioned, the environment remains very resilient and strong. Pricing remains firm in nearly all classes of business and we're seeing material firming in some niche lines. After multiple years of significant rate increases, we are seeing rate decreases in public company D&O. But as Pat noted, other lines such as cyber are still firming and flow remains solid. And thus the overall E&S market is still growing at a healthy rate. As we've said before, we expect the increasing flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our second quarter. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q2, we grew total revenue 26% period-over-period to $491 million, which was fueled by another excellent quarter of organic revenue growth coming in at 22.3% for the quarter, which reflects the continued tailwinds we're seeing in the E&S market, and as Pat and Tim noted, winning a substantial amount of new business. Net income for Q2 '22 was $70 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO-related and other unusual items, increased 15% period-over-period to $106 million or $0.39 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the second quarter grew 18% period-over-period to $166 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 220 basis points to 33.8%. Our margin was impacted by continued investments in the business, public company cost, as we were private in Q2 of 2021 and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels. It should be noted that relative to Q2 of 2019, which had a full run rate load of T&E expense, our margin was up 640 basis points this quarter. In addition, we completed our restructuring plan on schedule and are pleased to report that we have achieved $29 million of run rate savings, exceeding our initial goal of $25 million. As Pat and Tim noted, the current environment presents a unique and very exciting opportunity to hire A+ level underwriters and brokers and we expect to capitalize on this opportunity in future quarters to pursue and onboard top-tier talent. We fully intend to continue investing in our platform which allows us to generate sustainable margins, while producing industry-leading organic growth. Furthermore, our balance sheet remains fortified with $867 million of cash and cash equivalents at June 30 and our undrawn $600 million revolving credit facilities. Based on the current forward curve projections for SOFR, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds and includes amortization on our interest rate cap of approximately $30 million in Q3 and $31 million in Q4. It is important to be mindful that this increase is partially offset by the natural hedge in our fiduciary balances, which benefit from the rising rate environment. Given our strong execution through the first half of 2022 and the resilient E&S environment, we have raised our full year 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows. We are now guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2022 to be between 16.5% and 18.0%, which is up from the previous guide range of 13.5% to 15.5%. We are now guiding that our adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year '22 to be between 29.0% and 30.0%, up from the previous guide range of 28.5% to 30.0%. Our business is clearly capable of exceptional growth rates, but it's important to keep in mind, that our updated guidance prudently assumes, less favorable external conditions than we saw in H1 of this year. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance, particularly given the challenging macro environment. And we remain very excited about the path ahead for Ryan Specialty. With that, we thank you for your time, and we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question is just starting with the M&A outlook, you mentioned bolt-on as well as larger deals. Can you just give us a sense of what's in the pipeline? And how that's changed over the past quarter? I know on last quarter's call I walked away thinking you guys had an active pipeline and maybe close to something and we haven't seen anything get announced. Has something happened with multiples, or is it just taking a while to close transactions in this environment? \nPat Ryan: Well, the explanation of larger and tuck-ins was very specific because there are some opportunities that are larger. And when you have larger acquisition potentials there's a lot of work to do in terms of when they're ready to sell. Sometimes it's a little bit earlier than they planned and sometimes it takes longer to get to the value that they want. They identify us as a place they'd like to join, but we have to see more evidence of their projections. So, there are lots of variables. Tuck-ins we looked at many, at several. And either after examination through due diligence we found that it wasn't exactly what we felt was a good fit for either cultural reasons or financial reasons. So, you're right we haven't closed then any, but we're discrete. We only want acquisitions that will fit our culture will be strategic. And most importantly, will be -- very importantly not most importantly, very importantly will be accretive. And as we all know there's a lot of competition, but we don't usually compete like a lot of people do in this field -- about field of acquisitions. And that for the majority of the people that join us we were their destination of choice. And so we are working with people who would like to join us and we'd like to have them join us. We haven't reached conclusions yet. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question is on just your organic outlook as well as what you're seeing in the E&S market. It sounds like you're seeing no slowdown or just new business coming to the E&S market from the standard market, yet your second half of year guidance does imply a slowdown relative to the first half is that just conservatism? And are you expecting any slowdown to emerge in the second half of this year? \nJeremiah Bickham: Hi Elyse. The outlook for the remainder of the year is our typical prudent view and incorporates the variability of forecast. And most importantly the fact that -- and we've said this on a couple of calls by now the circumstances that lead to a 20% organic growth quarter are really hard to predict quite frankly. And even if you felt like you had pretty good line of sight it's questionable whether -- how prudent it is to put that in a guide. Tim can talk more if necessary. But I think he had really good color in his prepared remarks about the healthiness of the market right now and what we've seen in I think seven of the last nine quarters when there have been opportunities, we've been able to significantly overachieve and that's always our goal. But the implied performance of H2 is still very strong in the double-digit territory would represent a great finish to the year. We're just not -- we're just trying to stay prudent in terms of what we guide to. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay, great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Next question Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please go ahead.\nWeston Bloomer: Hey thanks for taking my question. My first one is just a follow-up to Elyse's question. So, if I'm interpreting the guidance right, is really the main change between kind of the first half and the second half just the amount of paper that could flow into the E&S channel, or is there some variability with potentially lower nominal GDP? Am I thinking about that correctly overall, or is there may be more difficult comps from the back half of the year last year?\nJeremiah Bickham: There's -- the sum Weston of everything that we know about the market and the macroenvironment including the uncertainty of the macro environment is factored in. But if you think about the implied range that we're talking about and really where we started the year like it should make sense that what we're guiding to what we're expecting is a really strong finish, but you have to remember like the baseline that we've said is double-digit. It's not 20% just because we've been fortunate enough and seize the opportunities to do that so frequently recently doesn't mean that that's the baseline of expectation we're trying to set.\nPat Ryan: I would add -- go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. \nWeston Bloomer: I was going to switch to another question. So, if you want to follow-up there? \nPat Ryan: Well, I was just going to add that in order to achieve 20%, particularly at the increased scale that we've grown into that is a very significant rate of growth in the insurance brokerage field scale until -- you have to have everything aligned properly. And it's never really wise or prudent to assume everything is going to align. Now that's what's been happening out of seven of nine quarters. And we're not saying it won't. We're just saying it's imprudent to predict that or forecast that.\nWeston Bloomer: Understood. And just as a follow-up, you've talked about the potential for seeing higher competition just due to more admitted riders moving over to E&S. I know you're at the early stages of it. I'm just curious, when do you think that's going to start to more materially happen? Is it just due to pricing in either the admitted market would potentially go below loss cost -- or is another factor that I'm not thinking about? And then, how would Ryan adjust once they start to see that more material competition in E&S?\nTim Turner: Weston, the current conditions that we see indicate a 30%-plus growth and volume into the channel. And that comes right from the stamping offices. So we see no real let up on flow into the channel. What we do see in a few lines like public D&O are some premium decreases and some migration back to the standard market. And I think that's what you're looking for and referring to. And we do see some signs in that line. And then in excess casualty in some of the large shared and layered towers some migration back into the standard market. But all of it is overshadowed by this increased flow of other E&S business into the channel led by cat property, cyber, healthcare, habitational, construction, transportation as an example. That flow continues to grow and we're perfectly aligned in our practice groups to capture that. So we see no letup in our ability to convert that new flow into the channel.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Next question Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Can you comment on what you're seeing with respect to increases in inflationary type of exposures? I'm not talking about unit economics more like higher insured values, higher gross sales, receipts et cetera. And I'm just wondering if you think inflationary type of exposure growth is going through some type of true-up right now, is it more episodic, or can this piece of premium growth maintain momentum?\nPat Ryan: Well, we clearly believe that inflation will drive up exposure growth. And so that's a proportional increase in premium. So that's pretty well-established. It depends on how you view the future of inflation in this country. But there's certainly a factor that's driving premiums up. In terms of our ability to adjust the inflationary front, as you know significant majority of our operating expenses are variable. And so we have the benefit of that variability. I think you also know that we have principally a high percentage of our business are compulsory products. So they have to buy. And if the rates go up, they still have to buy. And so there's that inflationary pressure, but the demand consistent. And so we're just raising those points. But we have to keep in mind that at some point people say the premium is too high. And so that will take a larger deductible things like that to adjust the cost of their premium. So the reality is that the insurers guided by good solid advice from the broker, both the retail broker in this case and the wholesale broker come to the right conclusion for that particular client. But at the end of the day, the client makes the choice.\nTracy Benguigui: So given that -- those different flows back and forth between higher deductibles and higher inflationary type of exposures, was that a net driver of your organic revenue growth this quarter?\nPat Ryan: It's early in that but yes to a modest degree. But if it continues as it is it will be a more significant driver.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. I'm also wondering do you guys play in the personal line space because there is talk about within some cat-exposed state of some of the larger insurers wanting to push that risk more in their non-embedded arms? Is that somewhere that you transact?\nTim Turner: It is Tracy. And specifically, it's the high net worth part of personal lines that we're active in. We have a practice group vertical. We have proprietary capacity in that space. And that really is a combination of our brokerage capabilities and our delegated underwriting authority expertise. So we're bringing more capital into that space. Very, very significant high demand for solutions there, due to global warming and its impact. So, it's a great opportunity space for us. \nTracy Benguigui: And how would you say, where you rank amongst peers on personal lines? \nTim Turner: I'm not sure about that. \nPat Ryan: Well, I would say that there's no published data. But just intuitively what we see in the marketplace we have a robust high net worth homeowners practice with some very exceptional talent. So, we're a significant player in that space. \nTracy Benguigui: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nRobert Cox: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was just looking for an update on your thoughts regarding double-digit organic growth for the foreseeable future. It feels like your revenue base is a little higher than maybe, what you would have anticipated. And so, I was just looking for an update on how -- what kind of timeframe you're thinking about for that type of guidance? And is it like, the next couple of years? Can it go further than that? And is it -- how dependent is it on pricing increases? \nPat Ryan: I'm going to answer the first part and give Jeremiah the ball. They're higher than what we forecasted. But we've been optimistic that we had all of the talent and the resources to enjoy the market that has come. So, we're not shocked by how well we've done in that market. The market has just continued to improve as you know. Jeremiah you pick up the rest of that please. \nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. So, when we talk about our growth engine, we talk about being built specifically use the word built for double-digit organic growth and we talk about the foreseeable future. Now the foreseeable future means different things to different people, but it's unwise to try and predict with too much precision out past like just say a couple of years.  And the reason we're so confident about a couple of years is because of the actual industry fundamentals, the secular tailwinds and secular features of our growth engine that have gotten us here so far. Those can't change on a dime. And recently, we've had a lot of those aspects of our growth engine like take the E&S market for example at a supercharged growth rate, that's not going to last forever. We've tried to communicate that that 20% is not the baseline, but double digits goes all the way down to 10%. And we did that and much better without the benefit of rate. In fact, when rate was going against us for several years, we printed comfortable double-digit organic growth then. We're comfortable that we're still capable of that, that our growth foundation our growth engine can do that for years to come, but we can't overemphasize enough that double digits doesn't mean 20%. \nRobert Cox: Okay. Thanks. That's great. And just in regard to the talent that you've hired this year or maybe even in the quarter, how does that compare to your history maybe as like a percentage of your employee base or something like that? Just trying to get a sense of how many people you've hired this year compared to historical levels. \nPat Ryan: Well compared to the historical normal levels because there are periods of early days when we hired large numbers of people off a small base. But directly to your question this has been a fertile year for attracting talent, filling some retirement holes in terms of people that performed really well for us, but they're ready to retire and attracting really high-quality people to replace them.  And also, to build depth and additional A players in several of our specialties. Additionally, we've been emphasizing data and analytics. And we've continued to add talent there to really put ourselves in a leadership position, as we go forward. So we've been using this period of talking about adding talent A-level talent. And we've done that, very satisfactorily for us, through the first two quarters.\nRobert Cox: Great. And if I could just ask, one more question. I know you had hired a leader for the employee benefits practice. So my question is, have you continued to invest in employee benefits in either talent or infrastructure despite no revenues at this point? \nPat Ryan: We have invested in talent, and particularly in infrastructure. We brought some really A and A+ level of talent in that sector, actuarial leadership for example, executive leadership. And they're doing a fantastic job in our opinion, of analyzing the market identifying the targets ,working with those targets. And frankly, just as we've added the P&C, M&A space I think we're emerging as a destination of choice for people in the benefit side, who are getting ready to anticipate a change in terms of joining with someone. And I think, we're in quite a good position in that area, because of the talent we've brought in the commitment we've made the capital that we've shown we're willing to commit to it. \nRobert Cox: Thank you for your answers.\nOperator: Next question Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Most of my questions were answered. But maybe, if you could talk about the various drivers of your organic growth whether it's growth in the E&S market in terms of exposure, pricing and then any changes in market share. Can you -- to the extent, you're able to quantify or just rank order, which ones have been the biggest drivers of your growth over the past year or so? \nPat Ryan: I think the biggest driver of our growth is winning competitively, in the marketplace because everybody's had the right factors and the exposure factors, but it's differentiated us and there's been some data published on this, is that we're growing faster than our peers and than our competitors I should say. And that's because our commitment to A-level talent. It's also our initial commitment, and sustaining, commitment to independence to no conflicts of our clients.  You'll see a stark difference between the wholesale growth of our position, as an independent. And for those who own captive wholesalers. So I'm not going to get into any other detail on that, but it's public data. And so \u2013 yes, we're winning. The biggest driver is we're winning more, in the market ahead. But we've been doing that all 11-plus years, it's particularly strong right now. \nJimmy Bhullar: And maybe another one, just on margins. Typically, with growth is strong you should see a lot of expansion in margins, but I'm assuming you intend to continue to invest in the business as long as you see this type of growth. So should we assume, fairly stable margins at least in the near term, or should we assume that margins, would expand commensurately with the growth in revenues?\nJeremiah Bickham: Well I won't go out beyond 2022 for guidance, but we have been consistent about the imperative to continue striking that right balance of investment and healthy margins. I think the healthy margins as an example, represented by our guidance. But Jimmy, you've studied us long enough to see, that exceptional growth does lead to scale and we're committed to banking some of that most of the time. I've said, publicly that, we intend -- we expect to on a reported basis, show margin improvement in most years, but there are times this year is a great example where it is the right long-term decision for both organic growth and margin to make investments. So we're going to stick to that plan. \nJimmy Bhullar : Okay. And just lastly with all this business flowing from the standard to the E&S market, and then also I think there's been consolidation of like annual consolidation on part of the -- some of the retail brokers. Are you envisioning any changes in sort of commission or fee structures and commissions you share with the retail brokers up or down?\nPat Ryan: No, I think it's very stable. We have a very strong relationship with our clients. They use us, because we bring value add. If they don't think we can bring value add, they don't use us. It's not over commissioned it's over whether they need us or not in their mind. And so fortunately, they continue to believe they need us and they do it. We deliver. We talk about execution. Execution and outcomes for our clients drives everything we do.\nJimmy Bhullar : Thank you.\nPat Ryan: Thanks for your questions.\nOperator: We have one more question coming from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I have one real question and then just one repetition. Tim, you've talked frequently about building a 50-state binding authority operation. Other than acquisitions, can you talk about what's going on internally or organically to get there? \nTim Turner : Well, historically, Meyer, these binding authority companies were very regionally oriented, and so they tend to give the underwriting authority out locally and not on a 50-state basis. So over the last several years, we've been able to get all of our trading partners to give us 50-state authority, which allows us to distribute binding authority in small commercial solutions more aggressively and to really have a strong opportunity to consolidate the small commercial business on a binding basis. Our electronic trading platform has been a big investment there. And so this platform that we have has created a 50-state solution-based ability that no one has ever had before. So we're bringing that to the market, and we're winning RFPs and the increase in flow in small commercial continues to grow for us. So, great long runway ahead in that space.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then Jeremiah, you gave sort of a definition of interest expense with regard to the third and the fourth quarter. And I'm not sure I got all the details. I was hoping to get you to repeat that please?\nJeremiah Bickham : Yes. So that's going to be our interest expense, Meyer, which is the interest that -- it's three pieces. It's the interest we pay on our term loan on our bond, it's also the amortization of our interest rate cap, which is -- we're very happy we did. We put on earlier this year, but then it's offset by interest income on our operating cash. So that's why you see in our financials, it's interest expense net. And so just based on the current SOFR curve, we thought we would take as much guesswork out of that for those at home playing the model game and just give our best guess of that for the next two quarters, assuming no major M&A.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. But the corresponding number in the second quarter that's at 248 [ph].\nJeremiah Bickham : Yes. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: I would like to turn the floor over to Pat Ryan for closing remarks. \nPat Ryan: Thank you all for your excellent questions and your support. We enjoy the chance to explain our company to you to be proud of our company and our results. And thank you for your continued support and have a good evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Tim. In Q2, we grew total revenue 26% period-over-period to $491 million, which was fueled by another excellent quarter of organic revenue growth coming in at 22.3% for the quarter, which reflects the continued tailwinds we're seeing in the E&S market, and as Pat and Tim noted, winning a substantial amount of new business. Net income for Q2 '22 was $70 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO-related and other unusual items, increased 15% period-over-period to $106 million or $0.39 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the second quarter grew 18% period-over-period to $166 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 220 basis points to 33.8%. Our margin was impacted by continued investments in the business, public company cost, as we were private in Q2 of 2021 and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels. It should be noted that relative to Q2 of 2019, which had a full run rate load of T&E expense, our margin was up 640 basis points this quarter. In addition, we completed our restructuring plan on schedule and are pleased to report that we have achieved $29 million of run rate savings, exceeding our initial goal of $25 million. As Pat and Tim noted, the current environment presents a unique and very exciting opportunity to hire A+ level underwriters and brokers and we expect to capitalize on this opportunity in future quarters to pursue and onboard top-tier talent. We fully intend to continue investing in our platform which allows us to generate sustainable margins, while producing industry-leading organic growth. Furthermore, our balance sheet remains fortified with $867 million of cash and cash equivalents at June 30 and our undrawn $600 million revolving credit facilities. Based on the current forward curve projections for SOFR, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds and includes amortization on our interest rate cap of approximately $30 million in Q3 and $31 million in Q4. It is important to be mindful that this increase is partially offset by the natural hedge in our fiduciary balances, which benefit from the rising rate environment. Given our strong execution through the first half of 2022 and the resilient E&S environment, we have raised our full year 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows. We are now guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2022 to be between 16.5% and 18.0%, which is up from the previous guide range of 13.5% to 15.5%. We are now guiding that our adjusted EBITDAC margin for the full year '22 to be between 29.0% and 30.0%, up from the previous guide range of 28.5% to 30.0%. Our business is clearly capable of exceptional growth rates, but it's important to keep in mind, that our updated guidance prudently assumes, less favorable external conditions than we saw in H1 of this year. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance, particularly given the challenging macro environment. And we remain very excited about the path ahead for Ryan Specialty. With that, we thank you for your time, and we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Hi Elyse. The outlook for the remainder of the year is our typical prudent view and incorporates the variability of forecast. And most importantly the fact that -- and we've said this on a couple of calls by now the circumstances that lead to a 20% organic growth quarter are really hard to predict quite frankly. And even if you felt like you had pretty good line of sight it's questionable whether -- how prudent it is to put that in a guide. Tim can talk more if necessary. But I think he had really good color in his prepared remarks about the healthiness of the market right now and what we've seen in I think seven of the last nine quarters when there have been opportunities, we've been able to significantly overachieve and that's always our goal. But the implied performance of H2 is still very strong in the double-digit territory would represent a great finish to the year. We're just not -- we're just trying to stay prudent in terms of what we guide to. There's -- the sum Weston of everything that we know about the market and the macroenvironment including the uncertainty of the macro environment is factored in. But if you think about the implied range that we're talking about and really where we started the year like it should make sense that what we're guiding to what we're expecting is a really strong finish, but you have to remember like the baseline that we've said is double-digit. It's not 20% just because we've been fortunate enough and seize the opportunities to do that so frequently recently doesn't mean that that's the baseline of expectation we're trying to set. Yes. So, when we talk about our growth engine, we talk about being built specifically use the word built for double-digit organic growth and we talk about the foreseeable future. Now the foreseeable future means different things to different people, but it's unwise to try and predict with too much precision out past like just say a couple of years.

We're comfortable that we're still capable of that, that our growth foundation our growth engine can do that for years to come, but we can't overemphasize enough that double digits doesn't mean 20%.

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. Before diving into the quarter, I want to acknowledge the team's efforts since we went public one year ago. I am pleased with our strong results, and we continue to have a long runway ahead of us. We remain true to our values are well-positioned to sustainably and profitably grow our business and believe that we will continue delivering long-term value for our shareholders. I'm also incredibly proud of our frontline. The producers, the underwriters and their teams who are out competing and winning head-to-head in the field by innovating with new products and solutions unrelenting in the pursuit of excellence and winning a substantial amount of new business. Our performance in the second quarter again, demonstrated the strength of our business continuing the track record of success, we've established over the past 11 years, we grew total revenue 26% led by outstanding organic revenue growth of 22%. We also achieved another quarter of double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. Our three specialties all performed very well, each generating strong double-digit growth for the quarter. Overall, I'm immensely pleased with our differentiated platform, which continues to prove that it's truly best-in-class, providing our clients and trading partners with the value and service they deserve. Throughout the second quarter, the E&S marketplace remained robust. In fact, the overall flow of business into our E&S lines is still at historically high levels. As we previously noted, we've invested significantly in those lines, where we see clear opportunities to grow in addition to bolstering the lines of business, where we have a leadership position. Through Q2, we remain in the prolonged stages of historically hard market. Broadly speaking, rates remained firm nearly all of our lines of business, or rates moderated in certain lines. We saw continued upward rate movement in other lines. In addition to the standard or a bit of a carrier competition, we observed on the periphery and which we flagged in prior earnings calls has yet to meaningfully impact rate or flow in the aggregate. We continue to invest in our intellectual capital throughout the quarter, adding to our already strong team and deep bench, and again, proving out that we are a destination of choice for the best talent in the industry. Here are a few of the many examples. We've added accomplished teammates within our renewable energy line and to our data and analytics and technology teams. We are also making significant valuable additions in many of our lines of business expanding new industry verticals. And the exceptional talent we've assembled since our founding, including recent additions over the last year has been hard at work developing new programs and introducing new products in our MGAs and MGUs, bringing new and existing capital in addition to arranging alternative capital to support our clients. We are also pleased to note that productivity among our brokers continues to improve and accelerate and is reflected in our strong Q2 earnings performance. This September will mark the two-year anniversary of our acquisition of All Risks, which has exceeded our expectations in all facets. All Risks is further proof that our business model provides a powerful platform for those looking to join Ryan Specialty, and validates our M&A thesis that we make strong businesses even better. As we look ahead to the rest of 2022, we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and in the geopolitical environment. That said, we believe we remain well-positioned and expect favorable specialty insurance market dynamics to persist. We also continue to invest in our various strategies to take advantage of the resilient, increasing flow into the E&S market and further expand our market share by building what we believe to be the most differentiated platform and deep expansion in the industry. We have benefited from a flight to quality and believe we have positioned ourselves to outperform our competition through the cycle. Moreover, we maintain a highly active M&A pipeline as we look for additional opportunities both tuck-ins and large acquisitions to enhance and differentiate our platform and capabilities. We are working from a position of strength given our strong balance sheet and ample capacity, which enables us to act when we find the right opportunities. As I've said before, we remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions. Any deal we consider must meet our criteria; a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive to our returns. Our M&A strategy is and will remain supplemental to our organic growth story. We are not a roll-up and we do not require acquisitions to achieve our growth targets. In summary it was another team effort at Ryan Specialty that contributed to a fantastic second quarter and first half of 2022. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President, Tim Turner. Tim? Well, the explanation of larger and tuck-ins was very specific because there are some opportunities that are larger. And when you have larger acquisition potentials there's a lot of work to do in terms of when they're ready to sell. Sometimes it's a little bit earlier than they planned and sometimes it takes longer to get to the value that they want. They identify us as a place they'd like to join, but we have to see more evidence of their projections. So, there are lots of variables. Tuck-ins we looked at many, at several. And either after examination through due diligence we found that it wasn't exactly what we felt was a good fit for either cultural reasons or financial reasons. So, you're right we haven't closed then any, but we're discrete. We only want acquisitions that will fit our culture will be strategic. And most importantly, will be -- very importantly not most importantly, very importantly will be accretive. And as we all know there's a lot of competition, but we don't usually compete like a lot of people do in this field -- about field of acquisitions. And that for the majority of the people that join us we were their destination of choice. And so we are working with people who would like to join us and we'd like to have them join us. We haven't reached conclusions yet. I would add -- go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Well, I was just going to add that in order to achieve 20%, particularly at the increased scale that we've grown into that is a very significant rate of growth in the insurance brokerage field scale until -- you have to have everything aligned properly. And it's never really wise or prudent to assume everything is going to align. Now that's what's been happening out of seven of nine quarters. And we're not saying it won't. We're just saying it's imprudent to predict that or forecast that. Well, we clearly believe that inflation will drive up exposure growth. And so that's a proportional increase in premium. So that's pretty well-established. It depends on how you view the future of inflation in this country. But there's certainly a factor that's driving premiums up. In terms of our ability to adjust the inflationary front, as you know significant majority of our operating expenses are variable. And so we have the benefit of that variability. I think you also know that we have principally a high percentage of our business are compulsory products. So they have to buy. And if the rates go up, they still have to buy. And so there's that inflationary pressure, but the demand consistent. And so we're just raising those points. But we have to keep in mind that at some point people say the premium is too high. And so that will take a larger deductible things like that to adjust the cost of their premium. So the reality is that the insurers guided by good solid advice from the broker, both the retail broker in this case and the wholesale broker come to the right conclusion for that particular client. But at the end of the day, the client makes the choice. It's early in that but yes to a modest degree. But if it continues as it is it will be a more significant driver. Well, I would say that there's no published data. But just intuitively what we see in the marketplace we have a robust high net worth homeowners practice with some very exceptional talent. So, we're a significant player in that space. I'm going to answer the first part and give Jeremiah the ball. They're higher than what we forecasted. But we've been optimistic that we had all of the talent and the resources to enjoy the market that has come. So, we're not shocked by how well we've done in that market. The market has just continued to improve as you know. Jeremiah you pick up the rest of that please. Well compared to the historical normal levels because there are periods of early days when we hired large numbers of people off a small base. But directly to your question this has been a fertile year for attracting talent, filling some retirement holes in terms of people that performed really well for us, but they're ready to retire and attracting really high-quality people to replace them.  And also, to build depth and additional A players in several of our specialties. Additionally, we've been emphasizing data and analytics.

And that's because our commitment to A-level talent. It's also our initial commitment, and sustaining, commitment to independence to no conflicts of our clients.  You'll see a stark difference between the wholesale growth of our position, as an independent. And for those who own captive wholesalers. So I'm not going to get into any other detail on that, but it's public data. And so \u2013 yes, we're winning. The biggest driver is we're winning more, in the market ahead. But we've been doing that all 11-plus years, it's particularly strong right now. No, I think it's very stable. We have a very strong relationship with our clients. They use us, because we bring value add. If they don't think we can bring value add, they don't use us. It's not over commissioned it's over whether they need us or not in their mind. And so fortunately, they continue to believe they need us and they do it. We deliver. We talk about execution. Execution and outcomes for our clients drives everything we do.

            "name": "Tim Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much Pat. As Pat highlighted, it was another outstanding quarter across all three of our specialties. In May for the first time in three years, we hosted our annual Ryan Specialty Broker and Underwriting Management conferences with over 800 of our teammates in attendance. It was incredibly exciting to bring the team together again. The event led by Pat and myself exemplified our culture of collaboration and you could feel the tremendous energy generated by the many talented and driven underwriters, producers and corporate leaders all in one place. Diving into our specialties, our wholesale brokerage specialty continued to achieve excellent growth across all property and casualty lines of business. In particular, cat property including wind, flood and fire has been the strongest driver of new business into the non-admitted market today and an absolute stalwart for us. As we noted on our last call, admitted markets faced pressure from reinsurers derisking their portfolios, which pushes more business into the E&S market. During the quarter, we saw an acceleration of this trend driven by one of the most challenging, reinsurance renewal cycles in a number of years. To that end, we've continued to develop innovative products and solutions in our brokerage MGA and MGU business in these high-hazard niches. Cyber continues to grow in importance due to its complexity. We believe the majority of cyber risks in America will flow into the E&S channel. We are seeing solid double-digit increases in submissions and expect that to continue. We complement our brokers with capacity from our cyber MGAs and MGUs. Construction is another class where we continue to see significant increases in flow. Our industry leading team with its depth and breadth in the channel is seeing solid double-digit increases in submissions for both infrastructure, projects and habitational construction. We don't see this slowing down and the pipeline for these classes remains at historic highs. Our transportation practice continues to grow nicely. Trucking in particular has remained very challenging and the class of business is very risky. And as a result that business is increasingly being directed into the E&S market. We added Crouse and Associates at the perfect time, and we remain well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this line. Our healthcare practice continues to grow with the addition of wholesale brokers and the development of products in our delegated underwriting authority specialties. In our Binding Authority specialty, we continue to experience solid growth in our small commercial lines. We have made additional progress hiring industry leading talent and we expect to continue to invest significantly in the specialty to drive organic growth. We are keeping a close eye on opportunities in the delegated authority market to consolidate into Ryan Specialty and we continue on the path toward creating the first truly 50-state Binding Authority operation. Our Underwriting Management specialty posted another strong quarter, while continuing to deliver solid underwriting results for our carrier trading partners. We are excited by the recent additions to our renewable energy MGU and the recent launch of new products. In addition, our Harleysville New York arrangement with Nationwide is beginning to bear fruit. AXSAL, our alternative risk de novo MGU and Emerald, our excess general liability MGU are both gaining traction and actively quoting and binding accounts. In terms of the E&S market, as Pat mentioned, the environment remains very resilient and strong. Pricing remains firm in nearly all classes of business and we're seeing material firming in some niche lines. After multiple years of significant rate increases, we are seeing rate decreases in public company D&O. But as Pat noted, other lines such as cyber are still firming and flow remains solid. And thus the overall E&S market is still growing at a healthy rate. As we've said before, we expect the increasing flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our second quarter. Thank you. Weston, the current conditions that we see indicate a 30%-plus growth and volume into the channel. And that comes right from the stamping offices. So we see no real let up on flow into the channel. What we do see in a few lines like public D&O are some premium decreases and some migration back to the standard market. And I think that's what you're looking for and referring to. And we do see some signs in that line. And then in excess casualty in some of the large shared and layered towers some migration back into the standard market. But all of it is overshadowed by this increased flow of other E&S business into the channel led by cat property, cyber, healthcare, habitational, construction, transportation as an example. That flow continues to grow and we're perfectly aligned in our practice groups to capture that. So we see no letup in our ability to convert that new flow into the channel. It is Tracy. And specifically, it's the high net worth part of personal lines that we're active in. We have a practice group vertical. We have proprietary capacity in that space. And that really is a combination of our brokerage capabilities and our delegated underwriting authority expertise. So we're bringing more capital into that space. Very, very significant high demand for solutions there, due to global warming and its impact. So, it's a great opportunity space for us. I'm not sure about that. Well, historically, Meyer, these binding authority companies were very regionally oriented, and so they tend to give the underwriting authority out locally and not on a 50-state basis. So over the last several years, we've been able to get all of our trading partners to give us 50-state authority, which allows us to distribute binding authority in small commercial solutions more aggressively and to really have a strong opportunity to consolidate the small commercial business on a binding basis. Our electronic trading platform has been a big investment there. And so this platform that we have has created a 50-state solution-based ability that no one has ever had before. So we're bringing that to the market, and we're winning RFPs and the increase in flow in small commercial continues to grow for us. So, great long runway ahead in that space."

Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today's call, I will provide a brief overview of the quarter and our strategy moving forward. Our President, Tim Turner, will then give an update on each of our three specialties and recent events. And lastly, our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham, will walk you through our financials. We'll then open it up for Q&A. Our first quarter of 2022 picked up seamlessly from our outstanding 2021 performance, as we grew total revenue 24%, led by organic revenue growth of 20%. We also achieved double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. Our excellent results were driven by strong growth across all three of our specialties. Our strong performance this quarter and in prior quarters continues to demonstrate that our differentiated platform provides considerable value to our clients and enables us to outperform in various environments and against any competition. We are pleased to see that the E&S marketplace remains robust. The market changes we perceived on the periphery, which we flagged on our prior earnings call, have not yet developed. Broadly speaking, rates remain resilient in the majority of our lines of business. While rate increases have moderated, they've been more than offset by the continued expansion of the E&S market. We continue to add to our best-in-class team. We hit the ground running with onboarding new teammates in Q1, particularly in our underwriting management specialty, proving that we are a destination of choice for the top talent in the industry. We believe we offer leading underwriters and brokers a unique value proposition, the ability to build a business by leveraging our industry-leading capabilities, which provides them with strong financial backing and infrastructure support, allowing them to focus on providing innovative solutions for our clients. Further bearing this out is our industry-leading retention for underwriters and producers, which speaks volumes to our winning culture. Moving forward, we expect to stay the course on our growth initiatives. We are on pace to onboard our largest broker class ever in 2022. We remain confident that these investments in the next-generation of teammates will be accretive for Ryan Specialty going forward. We are pushing ahead in our formation of de novos, which you'll hear more from Tim on. Moreover, as we have previously conveyed, we will complete our $25 million 2020 restructuring program by June 30 of this year. Looking ahead, we remain very confident in our ability to maintain steady and profitable growth. The E&S market continues to expand as the complexity of risks increases. And as we have for the last 11 years, we continue to take market share from our competitors. Along with our strong organic growth, we continue to maintain a highly active M&A pipeline as we look for additional opportunities to enhance our platform and capabilities. We have a strong balance sheet and ample capacity that enables us to act when we find the right opportunities. As we've noted before, we will remain disciplined and move forward only when we identify an opportunity that we believe is strategic, a strong cultural fit, and accretive to our shareholder returns. Simply, this was another outstanding quarter for Ryan Specialty due to our incredible team that is unwavering in their dedication to our clients and trading partners, our time-tested business model and our winning culture. We are well positioned to sustainably and profitably grow our business and to continue delivering long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President, Tim Turner. Tim?\nTim Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. As Pat highlighted, we picked up in 2022 right where we left off at the end of 2021, with a strong quarter across our specialties. These results are a testament to the teamwork across the firm, to our producers, our underwriters and their teams who roll up their sleeves and work day in and day out on behalf of our clients. In addition, we made significant strides in the quarter expanding our talent base, broadening our product offerings and continuing to strengthen our value proposition to our broker clients and capital providers. Our wholesale brokerage specialty continued to experience excellent growth across all property and casualty lines of business. In particular, cat property continues to see record submission flow as admitted markets face pressure from reinsurers derisking their portfolios, which pushes more business into the E&S market. Construction is another vertical where we see significant increases in flow, with our industry-leading team seeing solid double-digit increases in submissions for both infrastructure projects and habitational construction. Also, our professional liability, health care and cyber lines see an increasing flow of business into the E&S channel, which is driving outsized growth. We're also seeing strong growth in our Transportation Practice as the addition of Crouse and Associates has proved to be essential in winning accounts across our firm. Within our Binding Authority specialty, we continue to see strong growth in our small commercial lines and are experiencing widespread success in our binding carrier contract renewals. We're keeping a close eye on additional opportunities in the delegated authority market to consolidate into Ryan Specialty and continue on the path toward creating the first truly 50-state binding authority operation. Our underwriting management specialty also delivered a strong first quarter, growing revenue by double-digits on a year-over-year basis while continuing to deliver solid profits to our carrier trading partners. As we've noted before, we appreciate the trust these carriers have shown in us, and we are careful to manage our growth with the need to deliver underwriting profit for our trading partners. As a follow-on to our remarks in the last call, I'm very excited about our strategic arrangement with Nationwide, which provides us with limited exclusive access to its Harleysville of New York A+ XV A.M. best-rated paper, to support our underwriting manager specialty and alternative risk strategy. Through this arrangement with Nationwide and as we mentioned last quarter, we're excited to update you on the progress of two of our de novo MGUs. The first is AXSAL, an excess commercial auto insurance alternative risk group captive program created and managed by our recently acquired Keystone team. The AXSAL Captive will reinsure Nationwide's fronting capacity, with Nationwide retaining a percentage of the risk directly and through our Geneva Re joint venture. The second is Emerald Underwriting Managers, a primary and excess general liability MGU. We expect that Emerald will very soon be writing on Harleysville paper on an exclusive basis. The environment remains full of opportunities within this business line. We are very optimistic about the opportunities created by this new strategic alignment and these two de novo programs. These provide additional tools for Ryan Specialty to service our clients and trading partners. Additionally, our M&A pipeline remains robust, as Pat noted, including potential small and large opportunities and across a number of specialties. In terms of the E&S market, the environment remains very positive. While competition is still entering the market on the fringes, we have yet to see competition accelerate in any meaningful way. Pricing remains firm in nearly all lines of business, and flow was very steady through the first quarter of the year and through April, particularly with additional stress that we have seen in the admitted market. As we said before, we expect the increasing flow business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our first quarter. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q1, we grew total revenue 24% period-over-period to $387 million, which was fueled by strong organic revenue growth of 20.1%, benefiting from the continued tailwinds in the E&S market and the market share gains that Pat and Tim noted earlier. We were once again very pleased with our performance and especially with a very strong finish to the quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $18 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO-related and other unusual items, increased 13% period-over-period to $65 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the first quarter grew 14% period-over-period to $107 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 260 basis points to 27.7%. Primary drivers of our adjusted EBITDAC increase were our revenue growth, the continued realization of savings from our 2020 restructuring plan, and lighter professional services spend, which we expect will pick back up in Q2. However, our margin was impacted by continued investments in the business, public company costs, as we were private in Q1 of 2021, and T&E returning to normalized levels, which we flagged in our remarks last quarter. As a reminder, the latter two items will impact the second quarter margin as well. And it's important to note that relative to Q1 of 2020, our margin is up 560 basis points. As we previously noted, the current environment offers us a unique and very exciting opportunity to hire A+ level underwriters and brokers. And we expect to capitalize on this opportunity in future quarters by pursuing and onboarding top talent to our platform. Over the long-term, we expect that our growth will yield additional and sustainable operating leverage in the form of adjusted EBITDAC margin. Furthermore, our balance sheet remains quite healthy. During the quarter, we completed an opportunistic $400 million high-yield offering at a rate of 4.375%. In April, we converted our credit facilities to a term SOFR benchmark and purchased an interest rate cap on $1 billion of SOFR with a strike of 2.75%, capping our rates on that $1 billion through 2025. We would expect to straight line the cost of the cap over the life of the instrument. And further on interest rate exposure, we have a natural hedge with our operating and fiduciary cash balances. And similar to our peers, it earns a modest yield tied to the risk-free rate. In short, we believe that we are very well insulated from steep increases in the Fed funds rate. Given our strong execution, and a resilient E&S environment, we have raised our full-year 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows. We are now guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full-year 2022 to be between 13.5% and 15.5%. We continue to believe that our guidance is prudent given the prolonged stages of a very hard market and increased flow into the E&S market. We are also taking up the low end of our adjusted EBITDAC margin range for the full-year 2022 and are now guiding to end the year between 28.5% and 30.0%. As we previously noted, we are investing heavily in talent and growth in 2022 in order to continue serving our clients over the long-term, and many of those investments will be made in the second quarter and subsequent quarters. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance during the first quarter of 2022 and remain very excited about the path ahead for Ryan Specialty. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: And at this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks, good evening. My first question, so you guys took up your organic guidance, I'm just trying to get a sense. It sounds like you're not really seeing kind of the competition that you said you might have seen on the fringes, right, from last quarter. When you put together this new guide, are you assuming that you start to see that to a greater degree over the balance of the year or how should we think about just that impact on organic as we move through 2022?\nPat Ryan: I'll start with that. It's Pat. And Jeremiah will pick it up. It's just very hard to predict and we're not seeing much of it now. That's really the story on that. We just think it's prudent to keep those historical facts in mind. Jeremiah, why don't you pick it up?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. So that's the most important piece, out of prudence. And in an effort to be transparent and helpful, we flagged the competition we were seeing and noted that in our forecast there's the presumption that the markets cool off later in the year. The other thing, and that's still a factor in our forecast, just to be clear. Even though, as Pat said, we haven't seen that accelerate. We still think that's prudent to keep into the forecast. We also mentioned in the last quarter, and I'll just reiterate to give some other, some additional context on why the guide moved the way it did. You probably realize that our quarterly estimates are not linear. So the organic that we produce Q1 and how it relates to the full-year guidance was not a total surprise to us. And in addition to what we've observed in the past from the way extended hard markets eventually change, we also want to acknowledge the macro uncertainty out there that Pat noted last call as well, rising interest rates, inflation, general economic uncertainty and war. And remember that we're only four months into the year, and we'd love nothing more than to come give you a positive update in a couple of months. Q2 is actually our biggest quarter of the year. So hopefully, that's the case. But in the meantime, we feel the need to be prudent.\nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, you guys mentioned that you're going to be investing, right, by investing in talent and kind of bringing on more underwriters and brokers in the second -- I think starting in the second quarter. My sense is when companies have flagged hiring, right, that there's typically a lag, right? So there might be an impact on expenses, right, to start and then it takes time for these individuals to ramp up and really help from the revenue perspective. So can you help us think about the timing here? Is this something that you think could be a tailwind to organic growth in 2023 as you kind of ramp up on the hiring front this year?\nPat Ryan: I would say that it's a mixture of that. We have onboarded some very exceptional talent already. And then -- and so we expect that they'll start to produce in the second, third and fourth quarters. Additionally, we've hired people that have garden leaves and so that could be anywhere from 90 days to six months. But they're committed. They're highly talented. And they're real professionals. And in fact, those expenses will come on in the third and fourth quarter those that are deferred through the garden leaves. And so it's hard to say how productive they'll be in the third and fourth quarter, but these are seasoned professionals who have a great reputation in these niche practice groups that they're involved in. And so we're very optimistic about their ability to contribute in the relative near-term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nWeston Bloomer: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. My first one, to follow-up on the organic growth guide. To what extent does your guidance forecast a recessionary environment in the back half of the year? And do you think you can kind of maintain that overall organic growth in a potential recession? Just kind of curious how, I know you weren't necessarily public during the 2020 timeframe, but how did your book hold up over then? How are you positioned now? Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Weston, this is Jeremiah. Let me start on that and I think some context around how we build our budgets and our forecasts. It's actually not a top-down process. We go out to every producer, every underwriter in the field. And they have to do a bottoms-up by account build that we aggregate and interrogate, and that's how we get to our projection. A consistent theme as we were building the budget this year was this assumption and different timing for different lines is that there would be a market slowdown. And these people are highly seasoned professionals. They know their books. They know the market. But they're not making assumptions and we're not layering in broader assumptions about the macroeconomic environment. Earlier this year, I mean, things have already changed a lot just since January or February. So we're not making predictions about a recession or the timing or anything like that. And it's really hard to say how would you -- how would your forecast do against a recession or something like that. And every recession is different, as you know, Weston. But what I can do since you asked specifically is, there was a significant economic downturn in 2022. We put up record organic growth during that period, I'm sorry, in 2021. In 2020 and 2021, we were dealing with the effects of the pandemic, and you wouldn't know there was a pandemic or a downturn going on just based on our financials. If you look back to the prior two recessions, we certainly weren't public at those times, but the other brokers were resilient. So I don't have a great answer for you on how our specific forecast would change if we entered a recession. But as Tim mentioned and Pat mentioned in his remarks, the overall insurance market conditions that affect us the most are still healthy. So that's a positive sign. And then there's some other mitigating factors for us that are helpful if we get into a period of economic uncertainty. For example, our -- most of our -- the majority of our expenses are comp and the majority of our comp is performance-based and therefore variable. So we're not concerned, but we don't have a lot of precision around how our forecast changes in a recession.\nPat Ryan: There's another point that I would add to that, which is a high percentage of our brokerage in managing underwriting business provides compulsory insurance products. We're not heavily into discretionary. And the compulsory, they have to buy insurance because it's the law on comp or auto or they're borrowing money and the banks require, the lenders require. So it's a matter of what's happening to exposures, what's happening to payroll such as you run into a tougher insurance market, but also a slowdown in the economy. And there's not an ability to predict that balance. But clearly, the world is getting riskier and there's inflation, so that's raising exposures. And that does raise premiums. But there's just no way to calibrate that. It would be inappropriate for us to try to give you a number on that. Nobody can do that.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. That's all very helpful. My second question is more on the margin outlook, specifically around the compensation. I know you said, you saw a pretty steep pickup in hiring. I think total compensation was up close to 26% in 1Q versus 12% last quarter. Just how much of that increase was from hiring versus general wage inflation trends? And can you help me think about those two metrics as I move through the year? Like is 1Q the high-water mark for the accelerated increase in hiring or should it accelerate further from here? And what are your expectations for wage inflation throughout the year? Thank you.\nPat Ryan: Why don't you answer the wage inflation and I'll talk about the hiring.\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. So Pat will talk more about this, but the timing, I'll just give you a teaser, the hiring environment, the hiring opportunity, we still consider very rich. Depending on how you want to look at it, whether you're talking about the broker class or others, we're on pace to ahead of schedule there. But the timing of that is a little bit difficult to predict. Wage inflation, we've seen it, we've seen the impact as we look at offer letters, for example, for salaried employees that go out relative to what we had planned. There are some surprises, some increases in there. But again, the majority of our compensation is related to producers. And they're paid on a formula that's tied to revenue. So when their comp is going up, it's because revenue is going up proportionally. And the rest of the salaried or the non-variable comp piece hasn't had a material negative impact on us yet.\nPat Ryan: And we remain a destination of choice for talent in brokerage, binding and managing under a delegated authority so that we're casting a wide net for exceptional talent. We're not looking to just bring people in that are doing fine. We're looking for people who historically have done really, really well, that they can prosper in our culture and on our platform and our environment. And you can see the benefit of that as the All Risks brokers and managing -- and underwriting, binding underwriting; underwriting brokers have really increased their productivity. We can already see that in Crouse. So the idea is to keep bringing in seasoned professionals while, as Tim had referenced, bringing in young people right out of college and university or out of the military who have a lot of talent and no experience and putting them through our training program and our development program. All of those are accelerating.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, I had a couple of questions. First, just on organic growth. If you look at your results in 1Q, you mentioned in the release several drivers of that, including, I think, new clients, expanded relationships with existing clients, pricing. Can you give some dimension on what the contribution of each was or which one was a bigger driver than the other to the extent you're able to quantify the various drivers of the organic growth in 1Q?\nJeremiah Bickham: We don't break that out, Jimmy. What I will reiterate though is that the, if you're thinking about rate versus exposure, rate versus flow, the latter is much more significant in terms of driving growth opportunities for us. And the flow and Tim can expand on this, but what we're seeing, what we saw in Q1 and what we've seen reflected in the organic growth numbers was a healthy amount of new business, a healthy amount of flow into the E&S market that we were able to take more than our fair share of. And as our existing clients' needs and the risks that were already in E&S grew, we believe that we took more than our fair share of that as well. So it's a very balanced attribution. But Tim is there any more color you want to add?\nTim Turner: No, I would just add that the increase in non-admitted property and casualty business into the -- into our channel increased through the stamping offices and our association that records it, WSIA. So we know the flow continues to grow. And as Jeremiah said, we're capturing more of that.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then, can you talk about fiduciary income? And what do you expect for that? Like how sensitive is it to the move in rates? And to the extent you're able to quantify what your expectations are?\nJeremiah Bickham: Say that again, Jimmy?\nPat Ryan: Fiduciary.\nJimmy Bhullar: On fiduciary income, what do you -- how should that benefit or be affected by the rise in rates? And how much of leverage or how much leverage does it have to the increase in rates?\nJeremiah Bickham: So I'm glad you brought that up because I know inflation and rising rates are on everyone's mind. And we've got fixed rate debt. We've got interest rate caps, but our biggest hedge is a natural hedge, and it's the hundreds of millions of dollars that we have on our balance sheet, that premium in transit that we can invest. Now remember, though, that, that money doesn't belong to us so preservation of capital is priority one, two and three. And all the states have different rules about what you can do with it, and some of them are as limiting as you got to keep it in a savings account at a bank. And so it doesn't track, our yield opportunity doesn't track perfectly with the Fed funds rate or SOFR. But conservatively, and it's going to depend on a number of different things, Jimmy, but something conservative to model for this year as everything is moving around. And obviously, the yield opportunity, there's a lag to when interest rates rise. I would say one-month term SOFR minus 50 basis points, we could comfortably achieve this year. And in a -- and over the medium term in a more stable environment, we may be able to get tighter. But that's a safe assumption on our Fed balances this year.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then just lastly, if I could ask on your comments around talent and hiring. I think you mentioned it's a good environment for hiring. I would have thought it would be a bad environment for hiring given just wage inflation, competition for talent, low unemployment. But can you just expand on that a little bit? Are you talking about people from other brokers? Are you talking about people from outside the industry?\nPat Ryan: Both. Other brokers and other managing underwriters. We're not having a real problem with that because we're a very performance-based comp plan. And so we can pay nice rewards for good and exceptional performance. So as people look to join us, they're not looking at what is their salary as much as they're looking at, what is the growth opportunity and my short-term incentive plan and this platform that I'm joining. And then, frankly, we do have our equity program that's well disciplined. So that's attractive to people as well. So as we said in the past, one of the benefits of our going public, in spite of what's happened in the market in the last short period of time for everybody, almost everybody, the liquid stock that the New York Stock Exchange listed, the security is very attractive to people. And so the combination of all of that is giving us an opportunity to be quite competitive in terms of hiring without reaching in terms of fixed costs.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Scott: Hi, thanks for taking it. First one I had is just on the M&A pipeline. Any comments you have on what that looks like and how the current environment and potential changes in cost of capital and so forth would impact your M&A plans?\nPat Ryan: That's a question that we really welcome because we've been working the pipeline. And as we said, the pipeline is robust. I think you know by now that we're quite deliberate. So we have -- we always start with the cultural fit and then the strategic fit. And we don't do opportunistic deals, we do strategic. So we have discussions going with people that have proven their cultural fit, meet our strategic demands. And now we're in discussions to see that we can work out terms, including price, et cetera, to be accretive to our shareholders. Now sometimes it takes a little longer for them to be able to prove the accretion. So you can have discussions that could be prolonged for a few months. Like here's what we expect we can do on our own. And here's what we think we can do to help them once they're with us. And it's not always a natural meeting of the minds. But because we are a destination of choice, we have had the ability to continue those discussions until we're satisfied that, yes, this is a deliverable. We can make it accretive and we move forward.\nAlex Scott: That's helpful. Thank you. Second one I had is around inflationary impacts on the top-line. I guess some of the primaries talked about how exposure can also be impacted by the changing value of the underlying products, property, et cetera, that's being insured. I'd be interested, what's sort of embedded in your plans around that? I would think since maybe you laid out your full-year inflation's picked up and is that something that would help a bit just on the exposure unit side in terms of revenue growth?\nJeremiah Bickham: It definitely could. And we're hearing the same thing from carriers that as loss costs go up, they need to keep up. Periods of high inflation, what typically follows is a hard market as well. So there's a couple of different factors that could provide potential tailwinds to us. But we're not -- we haven't gotten too cute on the back half of the year in terms of the current inflationary environment. And that's providing a big boost. There's certainly the potential for it, though.\nPat Ryan: Well, the other part of that answer is that this is where brokers really earn their distinction. Because with inflation and of course, with interest rates moving up, coverages that were written a year ago, 18 months ago, two years ago are going to be paying out higher claims because of inflation, including social inflation. I think a lot of people are saying that inflation is not transitory now. It's a matter of how far and how fast it goes. So the good brokers, and that generally defines our team and our underwriters, are very careful because they have a responsibility to make sure that they're guiding the clients to protecting this exposure increase. Less experienced and less qualified brokers can take the easy way out and assume lower exposure increases. But I think our people are really professionally oriented to deal with that. So that does drive exposure increase. Very hard to quantify, but it's real.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. On the seasonality perspective, you previously mentioned that the first and third quarters you see lower organic revenue growth and in the second and fourth quarter, the opposite. I'm wondering if there are any pull forward in the first quarter that could affect second quarter organic revenue prospects or do you expect the same quarterly cadence of organic growth?\nJeremiah Bickham: So Tracy, I'm glad you asked that because Q1 and Q3 don't necessarily have to be the lowest organic growth, they're just the smallest. And Q2 and Q4 are the biggest. And sometimes that aligns with organic growth, but sometimes not. So look at last year, Q3 was, I believe, our highest organic growth percentage that quarter. So we expect the seasonality in terms of quarter size to follow its usual pattern, so one and three, the smallest; two and four, the biggest. But we're not seeing \u2013 we're not attributing what we achieved in Q1 to be any material -- be related to any material timing issues, like Q1 versus Q2 or Q1 and Q4.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on your comment that you're actually seeing very steady flows in the E&S market through April. I'm just wondering what about the next wave. When risks are really hard to place, it goes from admitted to non-admitted to eventually Bermuda. And you mentioned your Geneva Re joint venture earlier. Can you remind us your Bermuda capability and over time if you could see meaningful growth in that market?\nPat Ryan: Well, Geneva Re has partnered with Nationwide on specialty and then Ryan-related investors are very conscious of the underwriting discretion required to in effect do this appropriately. And so there's a conservative attitude on that. We have really high-quality underwriters. And I would add that we're dealing with really high-quality retail brokers. And so we're partnering together with those retail brokers to make sure that as the business that they're bringing comes to the E&S market, it's properly placed and it's placed with high-quality carriers. And so the partnership with Nationwide with A+ XV does attract quality business. So that's all working out quite well.\nTracy Benguigui: Can you also just remind me you account for that stake in Geneva Re under the equity method. So could we see that category growing over time as maybe another source of income?\nPat Ryan: No. No, it's a capital growth strategy.\nJeremiah Bickham: The benefits of it, Tracy, though, there's our capital investment, which you're correct to remember; it's on the balance sheet as an equity method investment. But related to Geneva Re is our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re, which we wholly own as of, I believe, it was the end of Q1 2021. And you will see the impact of that relationship and the growth in that MGU flow through our P&L like the rest of our MGUs.\nPat Ryan: That's a really good point. I probably misunderstood the thought of that question. But we were able to attract unusually capable reinsurance underwriting talent. And then partnering with Nationwide and their A+ XV balance sheet, they're carving out a very nice market position with high-quality ceding companies. And as a result of that, we've expanded our total addressable market significantly because we're now working with insurance carriers on providing them services that really are in our mission statement. So that is an added dimension to the joint venture relationship that we've described. When you have exceptional talent as we have and you have A+ XV quality balance sheet, you attract very high-quality business. And that's what's happening.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your questions.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks and good afternoon all. One of the issues that you talk about on, I guess, early on was that when retail brokers consolidate, then the fact that those retail brokers have consolidated their wholesale panel also inures to your benefit. And I was hoping you could talk about what exposure maybe the growth trajectory has if higher interest rates slow down the retail brokers acquisitions?\nJeremiah Bickham: That's a very good question. It's -- that effect is certainly not measurable yet. But if interest rates, we are hearing whispers from out in the M&A landscape that certain PE investors, for example, are thinking of a pause or a delay, maybe a wait and see on their M&A approach related to interest rates. So to the extent that strategics, the big retail brokers that are our trading partners that consolidate essentially customers for us, to the extent that, that changes their M&A outlook, it could have an impact. But I would expect them the strategics to have a more durable thesis on roll-ups and consolidation than the strategic just because they're strategic. But the most important thing is, Meyer, we haven't seen that impact yet.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's helpful. Do you have an idea of the timing of it? In other words, I'm assuming catastrophic scenarios, but if M&A goes away in the retail market, does it show up immediately in terms of slower growth or is there any sort of lag?\nJeremiah Bickham: That's probably a question for Tim.\nTim Turner: Sure. I'd be happy to. Hi, Meyer. No, we can't see any slowdown in growth related to M&A. I mean, most of these clients that are involved in it are our clients, the acquiring agency and the ones being rolled up in the private equity roll-ups and even the publicly traded broker clients. We just don't see that really affecting the business that's coming our way right now.\nPat Ryan: The other part of the M&A is that, as you know, we've established a third vertical in benefits, which is going to be mostly managing underwriting with some consulting attached to it and then the fourth vertical being alternative risk. And so there are opportunities in each one of those sectors that are quite interesting with some fairly abundant opportunities. It's really up to us to select the right ones for us. But both of those strategies and those verticals are in sectors that M&A activity is picking up in.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'll now turn the call back over to Pat Ryan for closing remarks.\nPat Ryan: Thank you, Operator. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your continued interest and support of Ryan Specialty. We always enjoy these discussions and the good give and take and the dialogue. We look forward to speaking with you again when we discuss our second quarter 2022 results. Thanks for your interest in our company and have a good evening.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Thank you, Tim. In Q1, we grew total revenue 24% period-over-period to $387 million, which was fueled by strong organic revenue growth of 20.1%, benefiting from the continued tailwinds in the E&S market and the market share gains that Pat and Tim noted earlier. We were once again very pleased with our performance and especially with a very strong finish to the quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $18 million or $0.06 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter, which excludes IPO-related and other unusual items, increased 13% period-over-period to $65 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the first quarter grew 14% period-over-period to $107 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 260 basis points to 27.7%. Primary drivers of our adjusted EBITDAC increase were our revenue growth, the continued realization of savings from our 2020 restructuring plan, and lighter professional services spend, which we expect will pick back up in Q2. However, our margin was impacted by continued investments in the business, public company costs, as we were private in Q1 of 2021, and T&E returning to normalized levels, which we flagged in our remarks last quarter. As a reminder, the latter two items will impact the second quarter margin as well. And it's important to note that relative to Q1 of 2020, our margin is up 560 basis points. As we previously noted, the current environment offers us a unique and very exciting opportunity to hire A+ level underwriters and brokers. And we expect to capitalize on this opportunity in future quarters by pursuing and onboarding top talent to our platform. Over the long-term, we expect that our growth will yield additional and sustainable operating leverage in the form of adjusted EBITDAC margin. Furthermore, our balance sheet remains quite healthy. During the quarter, we completed an opportunistic $400 million high-yield offering at a rate of 4.375%. In April, we converted our credit facilities to a term SOFR benchmark and purchased an interest rate cap on $1 billion of SOFR with a strike of 2.75%, capping our rates on that $1 billion through 2025. We would expect to straight line the cost of the cap over the life of the instrument. And further on interest rate exposure, we have a natural hedge with our operating and fiduciary cash balances. And similar to our peers, it earns a modest yield tied to the risk-free rate. In short, we believe that we are very well insulated from steep increases in the Fed funds rate. Given our strong execution, and a resilient E&S environment, we have raised our full-year 2022 outlook for organic revenue growth and adjusted EBITDAC margin as follows. We are now guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full-year 2022 to be between 13.5% and 15.5%. We continue to believe that our guidance is prudent given the prolonged stages of a very hard market and increased flow into the E&S market. We are also taking up the low end of our adjusted EBITDAC margin range for the full-year 2022 and are now guiding to end the year between 28.5% and 30.0%. As we previously noted, we are investing heavily in talent and growth in 2022 in order to continue serving our clients over the long-term, and many of those investments will be made in the second quarter and subsequent quarters. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance during the first quarter of 2022 and remain very excited about the path ahead for Ryan Specialty. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Yes. So that's the most important piece, out of prudence. And in an effort to be transparent and helpful, we flagged the competition we were seeing and noted that in our forecast there's the presumption that the markets cool off later in the year. The other thing, and that's still a factor in our forecast, just to be clear. Even though, as Pat said, we haven't seen that accelerate. We still think that's prudent to keep into the forecast. We also mentioned in the last quarter, and I'll just reiterate to give some other, some additional context on why the guide moved the way it did. You probably realize that our quarterly estimates are not linear. So the organic that we produce Q1 and how it relates to the full-year guidance was not a total surprise to us. And in addition to what we've observed in the past from the way extended hard markets eventually change, we also want to acknowledge the macro uncertainty out there that Pat noted last call as well, rising interest rates, inflation, general economic uncertainty and war. And remember that we're only four months into the year, and we'd love nothing more than to come give you a positive update in a couple of months. Q2 is actually our biggest quarter of the year. So hopefully, that's the case. But in the meantime, we feel the need to be prudent. Weston, this is Jeremiah. Let me start on that and I think some context around how we build our budgets and our forecasts. It's actually not a top-down process. We go out to every producer, every underwriter in the field. And they have to do a bottoms-up by account build that we aggregate and interrogate, and that's how we get to our projection. A consistent theme as we were building the budget this year was this assumption and different timing for different lines is that there would be a market slowdown. And these people are highly seasoned professionals. They know their books. They know the market. But they're not making assumptions and we're not layering in broader assumptions about the macroeconomic environment. Earlier this year, I mean, things have already changed a lot just since January or February. So we're not making predictions about a recession or the timing or anything like that. And it's really hard to say how would you -- how would your forecast do against a recession or something like that. And every recession is different, as you know, Weston. But what I can do since you asked specifically is, there was a significant economic downturn in 2022. We put up record organic growth during that period, I'm sorry, in 2021. In 2020 and 2021, we were dealing with the effects of the pandemic, and you wouldn't know there was a pandemic or a downturn going on just based on our financials. If you look back to the prior two recessions, we certainly weren't public at those times, but the other brokers were resilient. So I don't have a great answer for you on how our specific forecast would change if we entered a recession. But as Tim mentioned and Pat mentioned in his remarks, the overall insurance market conditions that affect us the most are still healthy. So that's a positive sign. And then there's some other mitigating factors for us that are helpful if we get into a period of economic uncertainty. For example, our -- most of our -- the majority of our expenses are comp and the majority of our comp is performance-based and therefore variable. So we're not concerned, but we don't have a lot of precision around how our forecast changes in a recession. Yes. So Pat will talk more about this, but the timing, I'll just give you a teaser, the hiring environment, the hiring opportunity, we still consider very rich. Depending on how you want to look at it, whether you're talking about the broker class or others, we're on pace to ahead of schedule there. But the timing of that is a little bit difficult to predict. Wage inflation, we've seen it, we've seen the impact as we look at offer letters, for example, for salaried employees that go out relative to what we had planned. There are some surprises, some increases in there. But again, the majority of our compensation is related to producers. And they're paid on a formula that's tied to revenue. So when their comp is going up, it's because revenue is going up proportionally. And the rest of the salaried or the non-variable comp piece hasn't had a material negative impact on us yet. We don't break that out, Jimmy. What I will reiterate though is that the, if you're thinking about rate versus exposure, rate versus flow, the latter is much more significant in terms of driving growth opportunities for us. And the flow and Tim can expand on this, but what we're seeing, what we saw in Q1 and what we've seen reflected in the organic growth numbers was a healthy amount of new business, a healthy amount of flow into the E&S market that we were able to take more than our fair share of. And as our existing clients' needs and the risks that were already in E&S grew, we believe that we took more than our fair share of that as well. So it's a very balanced attribution. But Tim is there any more color you want to add? Say that again, Jimmy? So I'm glad you brought that up because I know inflation and rising rates are on everyone's mind. And we've got fixed rate debt. We've got interest rate caps, but our biggest hedge is a natural hedge, and it's the hundreds of millions of dollars that we have on our balance sheet, that premium in transit that we can invest. Now remember, though, that, that money doesn't belong to us so preservation of capital is priority one, two and three. And all the states have different rules about what you can do with it, and some of them are as limiting as you got to keep it in a savings account at a bank. And so it doesn't track, our yield opportunity doesn't track perfectly with the Fed funds rate or SOFR. But conservatively, and it's going to depend on a number of different things, Jimmy, but something conservative to model for this year as everything is moving around. And obviously, the yield opportunity, there's a lag to when interest rates rise. I would say one-month term SOFR minus 50 basis points, we could comfortably achieve this year. And in a -- and over the medium term in a more stable environment, we may be able to get tighter. But that's a safe assumption on our Fed balances this year. It definitely could. And we're hearing the same thing from carriers that as loss costs go up, they need to keep up. Periods of high inflation, what typically follows is a hard market as well. So there's a couple of different factors that could provide potential tailwinds to us. But we're not -- we haven't gotten too cute on the back half of the year in terms of the current inflationary environment. And that's providing a big boost. There's certainly the potential for it, though. So Tracy, I'm glad you asked that because Q1 and Q3 don't necessarily have to be the lowest organic growth, they're just the smallest. And Q2 and Q4 are the biggest. And sometimes that aligns with organic growth, but sometimes not. So look at last year, Q3 was, I believe, our highest organic growth percentage that quarter. So we expect the seasonality in terms of quarter size to follow its usual pattern, so one and three, the smallest; two and four, the biggest. But we're not seeing \u2013 we're not attributing what we achieved in Q1 to be any material -- be related to any material timing issues, like Q1 versus Q2 or Q1 and Q4. The benefits of it, Tracy, though, there's our capital investment, which you're correct to remember; it's on the balance sheet as an equity method investment. But related to Geneva Re is our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re, which we wholly own as of, I believe, it was the end of Q1 2021. And you will see the impact of that relationship and the growth in that MGU flow through our P&L like the rest of our MGUs. That's a very good question. It's -- that effect is certainly not measurable yet. But if interest rates, we are hearing whispers from out in the M&A landscape that certain PE investors, for example, are thinking of a pause or a delay, maybe a wait and see on their M&A approach related to interest rates. So to the extent that strategics, the big retail brokers that are our trading partners that consolidate essentially customers for us, to the extent that, that changes their M&A outlook, it could have an impact. But I would expect them the strategics to have a more durable thesis on roll-ups and consolidation than the strategic just because they're strategic. But the most important thing is, Meyer, we haven't seen that impact yet. That's probably a question for Tim."

            "name": "Pat Ryan",
            "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today's call, I will provide a brief overview of the quarter and our strategy moving forward. Our President, Tim Turner, will then give an update on each of our three specialties and recent events. And lastly, our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham, will walk you through our financials. We'll then open it up for Q&A. Our first quarter of 2022 picked up seamlessly from our outstanding 2021 performance, as we grew total revenue 24%, led by organic revenue growth of 20%. We also achieved double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. Our excellent results were driven by strong growth across all three of our specialties. Our strong performance this quarter and in prior quarters continues to demonstrate that our differentiated platform provides considerable value to our clients and enables us to outperform in various environments and against any competition. We are pleased to see that the E&S marketplace remains robust. The market changes we perceived on the periphery, which we flagged on our prior earnings call, have not yet developed. Broadly speaking, rates remain resilient in the majority of our lines of business. While rate increases have moderated, they've been more than offset by the continued expansion of the E&S market. We continue to add to our best-in-class team. We hit the ground running with onboarding new teammates in Q1, particularly in our underwriting management specialty, proving that we are a destination of choice for the top talent in the industry. We believe we offer leading underwriters and brokers a unique value proposition, the ability to build a business by leveraging our industry-leading capabilities, which provides them with strong financial backing and infrastructure support, allowing them to focus on providing innovative solutions for our clients. Further bearing this out is our industry-leading retention for underwriters and producers, which speaks volumes to our winning culture. Moving forward, we expect to stay the course on our growth initiatives. We are on pace to onboard our largest broker class ever in 2022. We remain confident that these investments in the next-generation of teammates will be accretive for Ryan Specialty going forward. We are pushing ahead in our formation of de novos, which you'll hear more from Tim on. Moreover, as we have previously conveyed, we will complete our $25 million 2020 restructuring program by June 30 of this year. Looking ahead, we remain very confident in our ability to maintain steady and profitable growth. The E&S market continues to expand as the complexity of risks increases. And as we have for the last 11 years, we continue to take market share from our competitors. Along with our strong organic growth, we continue to maintain a highly active M&A pipeline as we look for additional opportunities to enhance our platform and capabilities. We have a strong balance sheet and ample capacity that enables us to act when we find the right opportunities. As we've noted before, we will remain disciplined and move forward only when we identify an opportunity that we believe is strategic, a strong cultural fit, and accretive to our shareholder returns. Simply, this was another outstanding quarter for Ryan Specialty due to our incredible team that is unwavering in their dedication to our clients and trading partners, our time-tested business model and our winning culture. We are well positioned to sustainably and profitably grow our business and to continue delivering long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our President, Tim Turner. Tim? I'll start with that. It's Pat. And Jeremiah will pick it up. It's just very hard to predict and we're not seeing much of it now. That's really the story on that. We just think it's prudent to keep those historical facts in mind. Jeremiah, why don't you pick it up? I would say that it's a mixture of that. We have onboarded some very exceptional talent already. And then -- and so we expect that they'll start to produce in the second, third and fourth quarters. Additionally, we've hired people that have garden leaves and so that could be anywhere from 90 days to six months. But they're committed. They're highly talented. And they're real professionals. And in fact, those expenses will come on in the third and fourth quarter those that are deferred through the garden leaves. And so it's hard to say how productive they'll be in the third and fourth quarter, but these are seasoned professionals who have a great reputation in these niche practice groups that they're involved in. And so we're very optimistic about their ability to contribute in the relative near-term. There's another point that I would add to that, which is a high percentage of our brokerage in managing underwriting business provides compulsory insurance products. We're not heavily into discretionary. And the compulsory, they have to buy insurance because it's the law on comp or auto or they're borrowing money and the banks require, the lenders require. So it's a matter of what's happening to exposures, what's happening to payroll such as you run into a tougher insurance market, but also a slowdown in the economy. And there's not an ability to predict that balance. But clearly, the world is getting riskier and there's inflation, so that's raising exposures. And that does raise premiums. But there's just no way to calibrate that. It would be inappropriate for us to try to give you a number on that. Nobody can do that. Why don't you answer the wage inflation and I'll talk about the hiring. And we remain a destination of choice for talent in brokerage, binding and managing under a delegated authority so that we're casting a wide net for exceptional talent. We're not looking to just bring people in that are doing fine. We're looking for people who historically have done really, really well, that they can prosper in our culture and on our platform and our environment. And you can see the benefit of that as the All Risks brokers and managing -- and underwriting, binding underwriting; underwriting brokers have really increased their productivity. We can already see that in Crouse. So the idea is to keep bringing in seasoned professionals while, as Tim had referenced, bringing in young people right out of college and university or out of the military who have a lot of talent and no experience and putting them through our training program and our development program. All of those are accelerating. Fiduciary. Both. Other brokers and other managing underwriters. We're not having a real problem with that because we're a very performance-based comp plan. And so we can pay nice rewards for good and exceptional performance. So as people look to join us, they're not looking at what is their salary as much as they're looking at, what is the growth opportunity and my short-term incentive plan and this platform that I'm joining. And then, frankly, we do have our equity program that's well disciplined. So that's attractive to people as well. So as we said in the past, one of the benefits of our going public, in spite of what's happened in the market in the last short period of time for everybody, almost everybody, the liquid stock that the New York Stock Exchange listed, the security is very attractive to people. And so the combination of all of that is giving us an opportunity to be quite competitive in terms of hiring without reaching in terms of fixed costs. That's a question that we really welcome because we've been working the pipeline. And as we said, the pipeline is robust. I think you know by now that we're quite deliberate. So we have -- we always start with the cultural fit and then the strategic fit. And we don't do opportunistic deals, we do strategic. So we have discussions going with people that have proven their cultural fit, meet our strategic demands. And now we're in discussions to see that we can work out terms, including price, et cetera, to be accretive to our shareholders. Now sometimes it takes a little longer for them to be able to prove the accretion. So you can have discussions that could be prolonged for a few months. Like here's what we expect we can do on our own. And here's what we think we can do to help them once they're with us. And it's not always a natural meeting of the minds. But because we are a destination of choice, we have had the ability to continue those discussions until we're satisfied that, yes, this is a deliverable. We can make it accretive and we move forward. Well, the other part of that answer is that this is where brokers really earn their distinction. Because with inflation and of course, with interest rates moving up, coverages that were written a year ago, 18 months ago, two years ago are going to be paying out higher claims because of inflation, including social inflation. I think a lot of people are saying that inflation is not transitory now. It's a matter of how far and how fast it goes. So the good brokers, and that generally defines our team and our underwriters, are very careful because they have a responsibility to make sure that they're guiding the clients to protecting this exposure increase. Less experienced and less qualified brokers can take the easy way out and assume lower exposure increases. But I think our people are really professionally oriented to deal with that. So that does drive exposure increase. Very hard to quantify, but it's real. Well, Geneva Re has partnered with Nationwide on specialty and then Ryan-related investors are very conscious of the underwriting discretion required to in effect do this appropriately. And so there's a conservative attitude on that. We have really high-quality underwriters. And I would add that we're dealing with really high-quality retail brokers. And so we're partnering together with those retail brokers to make sure that as the business that they're bringing comes to the E&S market, it's properly placed and it's placed with high-quality carriers. And so the partnership with Nationwide with A+ XV does attract quality business. So that's all working out quite well. No. No, it's a capital growth strategy. That's a really good point. I probably misunderstood the thought of that question. But we were able to attract unusually capable reinsurance underwriting talent. And then partnering with Nationwide and their A+ XV balance sheet, they're carving out a very nice market position with high-quality ceding companies. And as a result of that, we've expanded our total addressable market significantly because we're now working with insurance carriers on providing them services that really are in our mission statement. So that is an added dimension to the joint venture relationship that we've described. When you have exceptional talent as we have and you have A+ XV quality balance sheet, you attract very high-quality business. And that's what's happening. The other part of the M&A is that, as you know, we've established a third vertical in benefits, which is going to be mostly managing underwriting with some consulting attached to it and then the fourth vertical being alternative risk. And so there are opportunities in each one of those sectors that are quite interesting with some fairly abundant opportunities. It's really up to us to select the right ones for us. But both of those strategies and those verticals are in sectors that M&A activity is picking up in. Thank you, Operator. And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your continued interest and support of Ryan Specialty. We always enjoy these discussions and the good give and take and the dialogue. We look forward to speaking with you again when we discuss our second quarter 2022 results. Thanks for your interest in our company and have a good evening."

            "name": "Tim Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. As Pat highlighted, we picked up in 2022 right where we left off at the end of 2021, with a strong quarter across our specialties. These results are a testament to the teamwork across the firm, to our producers, our underwriters and their teams who roll up their sleeves and work day in and day out on behalf of our clients. In addition, we made significant strides in the quarter expanding our talent base, broadening our product offerings and continuing to strengthen our value proposition to our broker clients and capital providers. Our wholesale brokerage specialty continued to experience excellent growth across all property and casualty lines of business. In particular, cat property continues to see record submission flow as admitted markets face pressure from reinsurers derisking their portfolios, which pushes more business into the E&S market. Construction is another vertical where we see significant increases in flow, with our industry-leading team seeing solid double-digit increases in submissions for both infrastructure projects and habitational construction. Also, our professional liability, health care and cyber lines see an increasing flow of business into the E&S channel, which is driving outsized growth. We're also seeing strong growth in our Transportation Practice as the addition of Crouse and Associates has proved to be essential in winning accounts across our firm. Within our Binding Authority specialty, we continue to see strong growth in our small commercial lines and are experiencing widespread success in our binding carrier contract renewals. We're keeping a close eye on additional opportunities in the delegated authority market to consolidate into Ryan Specialty and continue on the path toward creating the first truly 50-state binding authority operation. Our underwriting management specialty also delivered a strong first quarter, growing revenue by double-digits on a year-over-year basis while continuing to deliver solid profits to our carrier trading partners. As we've noted before, we appreciate the trust these carriers have shown in us, and we are careful to manage our growth with the need to deliver underwriting profit for our trading partners. As a follow-on to our remarks in the last call, I'm very excited about our strategic arrangement with Nationwide, which provides us with limited exclusive access to its Harleysville of New York A+ XV A.M. best-rated paper, to support our underwriting manager specialty and alternative risk strategy. Through this arrangement with Nationwide and as we mentioned last quarter, we're excited to update you on the progress of two of our de novo MGUs. The first is AXSAL, an excess commercial auto insurance alternative risk group captive program created and managed by our recently acquired Keystone team. The AXSAL Captive will reinsure Nationwide's fronting capacity, with Nationwide retaining a percentage of the risk directly and through our Geneva Re joint venture. The second is Emerald Underwriting Managers, a primary and excess general liability MGU. We expect that Emerald will very soon be writing on Harleysville paper on an exclusive basis. The environment remains full of opportunities within this business line. We are very optimistic about the opportunities created by this new strategic alignment and these two de novo programs. These provide additional tools for Ryan Specialty to service our clients and trading partners. Additionally, our M&A pipeline remains robust, as Pat noted, including potential small and large opportunities and across a number of specialties. In terms of the E&S market, the environment remains very positive. While competition is still entering the market on the fringes, we have yet to see competition accelerate in any meaningful way. Pricing remains firm in nearly all lines of business, and flow was very steady through the first quarter of the year and through April, particularly with additional stress that we have seen in the admitted market. As we said before, we expect the increasing flow business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. And with that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our first quarter. Thank you. No, I would just add that the increase in non-admitted property and casualty business into the -- into our channel increased through the stamping offices and our association that records it, WSIA. So we know the flow continues to grow. And as Jeremiah said, we're capturing more of that. Sure. I'd be happy to. Hi, Meyer. No, we can't see any slowdown in growth related to M&A. I mean, most of these clients that are involved in it are our clients, the acquiring agency and the ones being rolled up in the private equity roll-ups and even the publicly traded broker clients. We just don't see that really affecting the business that's coming our way right now."

Mr. Ryan, please go ahead sir.\nPat Ryan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results. With me on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; and our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller. Also with us is our Director of Investor Relations, Nick Mezick. 2023 was another outstanding year for Ryan Specialty. Our team continues to excel with the steadfast efforts to deliver top quality service to our clients. Through a combination of industry-leading talent and dedication to our clients, we generated another year of strong results while making long-term sustainable investments in our business to fortify our competitive position. For the full year, we surpassed revenues of $2 billion, up 20.4% year-over-year, driven by organic growth of 15% on top of the 16.4% in 2022. We also had a meaningful contribution from recent M&A. We grew full year adjusted EBITDAC 20.7% to $625 million and expanded adjusted EBITDAC margins by 10 basis points to 30.1%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 20% to $1.38. We also successfully executed on our strategy to add to our total addressable market. Our overall strategy is aligned around serving the evolving and growing needs of our clients in order to provide a dynamic value proposition. For a double-digit organic growth engine, and our M&A strategy, we are steadily expanding our total addressable market within specialty insurance, particularly with targeted investments and dedicated authority, benefits, alternative risks as well as deepening our considerable moat by enhancing our scale, scope and intellectual capital. 2023 marked the second best year for M&A, only topped in 2020 when we acquired All Risks. We successfully completed and announced several acquisitions with annual historic revenue totaling in excess of $140 million, adding and integrating new capabilities to each of our three specialties. Griffin Underwriting Services broadened our geographic scope and capabilities and our binding authority in brokerage specialties. Our Socius Insurance Services deepened our scale in our key urban centers and added a high-quality talent to our Professional Lines, Cyber Liability and Property Teams. ACE, Point6 and AccuRisk, provided foundational capabilities for our employee benefits, distribution and underwriting platform and are rapidly developing new products and service offerings to help our clients with integrated health solutions. In late December, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Castel Underwriting Agencies, which is anticipated to close in the first half of this year. We expect the Castel team to add approximately $44 million of annual revenue. Castel adds top talent and differentiated intellectual capital through 13 unique MGUs and has an excellent track record of delivering strong underwriting profits to its capital providers. Our geographic focus in the UK and Europe will significantly expand our international footprint, and we expect our management team and operations to be a catalyst for new delegated underwriting authority start-ups and accelerated international expansion. Further, we've developed new proprietary products and capabilities and underwriting management with multiple transportation facilities, and [indiscernible] Verdant, our high net worth MGU, offering coastal wind and wildfire coverage to a highly dislocated homeowners insurance market. In addition, several of our MGUs have expanded geographically in the UK, Canada and Singapore, growing our global footprint and expanding our total addressable market. In particular, we're excited about Perse International, our wind and solar property MGU with a recent launch in the UK. Stepping back, our delegated authority specialties are well positioned to execute on both organic and inorganic opportunities. Our offering to carriers is stronger than ever, built through investment in top talent and a heavily resourced platform, which includes actuarial and IT support as well as broad-based distribution. Our market position is further strengthened by our ability to retain our talent through our culture of empowerment, innovation and client centricity. We share a like-minded view of risk and partnership with our carriers as demonstrated by our excellent track record of underwriting results. We are confident that our investment in people and the platform will help ensure our ability to sustainably grow our value proposition over the longer term and perform well through economic cycles. Turning to talent. We made strategic investments in talent in 2023 to further strengthen our capabilities in both current and developing lines of business on the back of onboarding our largest production class in history in 2022. Collectively, these investments in talent are well on track to meaningfully contribute to our future performance. As we've noted previously, they are a key part of our proven winning formula to maintain and strengthen our long-term growth prospects. We were pleased to finish the year once again with industry-leading producer retention. While we have been successful at onboarding key talent, it's equally important to maintain a winning empowering culture that ensures our top producers remain at our firm. We continue to succeed on that front. It is both the exceptional quality and quantity of talent that distinguishes Ryan Specialty from the rest of the industry. We remain dedicated to recruiting, training and developing large teams of talent from college hires to experienced brokers and underwriters. As a result of our efforts, we accelerate the learning curve of these individuals, which helps them compete at the highest level. Our clients consistently emphasize that it's our differentiated talent that ensures they can trust us to solve their most challenging problems. Our commitment to onboarding and retaining the best and most innovative talent and our emphasis on delivering value for our clients has been vital to our mission since our founding. This is why we continue to generate industry-leading organic growth and why we believe we can successfully sustain these levels of growth over the long-term. Turning to capital allocation, M&A remains our top priority, and we entered the year with significant momentum. We are cultivating a wealth of opportunities. And as market conditions are improving, we have an ambitious M&A outlook for 2024. We continue to see substantial M&A opportunities that we expect will bolster our organic growth engine. Our M&A pipeline remains robust and includes both tuck-ins and potential large deals. As we've consistently noted, we will only move forward when all of our criteria for M&A are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. Additionally, given our broad financial flexibility, we are pleased to initiate a quarterly dividend program to return capital and create additional value for our shareholders. But assisted by our Board to initiate the cash dividend program reflects confidence in our ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth, generate strong cash flow over the long-term and execute on a robust M&A program. It is also a testament of our ability to be excellent stewards of capital for our investors as we believe we can both seamlessly execute on our robust M&A pipeline for years to come and distribute dividends to our shareholders. We remain firmly committed to our successful long-term strategy. One, organically investing in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth; two, executing on our disciplined M&A strategy with high-quality acquisitions; and three, maintaining our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which create value for our shareholders. As we progress through 2024, there are four things you can continue to expect from Ryan Specialty. First, we expect to generate another year of double-digit organic growth, driven by secular growth factors and the strategies we are pursuing. Secular growth drivers like retail brokers becoming larger through solid organic growth and ongoing industry consolidation, retail brokers pursuing panel consolidation for both open market wholesale and delegated authority in order to have fewer more sophisticated counterparties who have the necessary scale to meet their needs. We believe that we are one of very few specialty insurance firms that meet those criteria. The world is continuing to increase in risk and complexity. This is driving more risks and new exposures into the E&S marketplace, which offers significantly more freedom of rate and form and therefore, able to provide solutions that otherwise are not available. We believe the E&S market will keep growing and consistently outpace growth in the admitted market, overshadowing any cyclical shifts in certain lines with respect to submission flow and pricing. This is further aided by changes in distribution trends with a growing number of wholesale-only E&S carriers in the marketplace. Adding to these secular growth drivers is our unique competitive position in high-growth businesses, the expansion of our total addressable market and our ability to innovate with new product development, all of which serve to bolster our organic growth engine. We remain confident that these ongoing trends are sustainable and will continue to support our growth for the foreseeable future. Second, we will continue to grow through M&A. As mentioned earlier, we are steadily expanding our total addressable market within specialty insurance, including in delegated authority, alternative risks, benefits and deepening our considerable moat by enhancing our scale, scope and intellectual capital. We will complete the integration of our 2023 acquisitions and onboard the great team from Castel. Further, we will help these firms grow on our platform through our broad distribution network, access to our proprietary products and our deep carrier relationships. Third, we will continue to thoughtfully invest in our business. We expect another year of strategic hiring of top industry talent across our specialties. And we'll make additional investments in our systems and operations to ensure we remain at the forefront of the industry. Lastly, we will continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Notably, we will execute on our ACCELERATE 2025 program, driving continued growth and innovation, delivering sustainable productivity improvements over the long term and accelerating our margin improvement. As a reminder, we expect to generate annual savings of approximately $50 million in 2025 for some of the savings to be realized in 2024. With our flexible and differentiated business model, unparalleled expertise, innovation and work out that our clients and trading partners value, we are well positioned for another strong year in 2024. In summary, I remain incredibly proud of our entire team who are delivering another year of outstanding results and adding value for our clients, trading partners and ultimately, our shareholders. Now I am pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim?\nTim Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. The fourth quarter capped off an excellent 2023 for Ryan Specialty as we generated another quarter of double-digit growth across all our specialties. Turning to the market, ongoing industry trends persist or are accelerating, notably an increasingly complex climate and legal environment marked by nuclear verdicts, accelerating social inflation, rising uncertainty regarding reserve adequacy and a pullback in risk appetite from the admitted market. These trends are driving more risks into the E&S marketplace, which is better able to handle a more uncertain environment as it offers significantly more freedom of rate in form and the ability for insurers and underwriters to adjust more quickly. As a result, the E&S market is seeing a consistent flow of risks as it is able to provide critical solutions that would otherwise not be available. This continues to create fantastic opportunities for our specialized and industry-leading teams to provide solutions on behalf of our clients. Diving into our specialties, our wholesale brokerage specialty generated another quarter of strong growth. In property, elevated loss activity, including $50 billion of insured losses from severe convective storms, higher reinsurance costs and retentions of risk, persistent inflation and ongoing focus on insurance to value make for a challenging market. These factors are continuing to drive flow of new business into the E&S market. We continue to see the E&S market respond well, yet with continued discipline and tighter limit management especially around coastal property, wildfire and flood, along with increased concern of earthquake risk. Given heightened frequency and severity of property losses, particularly in coastal areas, and more recently in the Midwest, we believe risks will remain in the E&S market. This will drive recurring opportunities for talented experts to deliver critical solutions to our trading partners and placing these complex risks. We believe property should continue to be a strong driver of growth for Ryan Specialty in 2024, driven by sustained flow into the channel and continued yet more stabilizing rate increases. Our casualty practice had another strong quarter, driven by flow into the E&S market in both primary and excess casualty, particularly for habitational risks, health care, transportation, sports and entertainment and consumer products. Our transportation practice saw another quarter of strong flow difficult loss trends driven by both economic and severe social inflation are driving carrier need for continued rate increases, a pullback in underwriter appetite and market exits. These casualty classes are experiencing higher loss trends driven by economic and social inflation reserving issues due to the long tail nature and latency in claims, plus higher reinsurance costs. With our world class technical expertise and deep bench, we are perfectly positioned to execute and deliver value for our clients, particularly in a more unpredictable market. We are optimistic that casualty will be a strong contributor to our 2024 performance. Overall, it was a great year for our wholesale brokerage specialty. The team remains committed to delivering innovative strategies and products to meet the ever changing needs of the marketplace for our clients and we are well positioned to generate consistent, profitable growth. Now, turning to our delegated authority specialties which include both binding and underwriting management. Our binding authority specialty had another excellent quarter driven by key contributions from our high caliber talent and new proprietary products which make for a seamless experience for our clients on small but tough to place commercial P&C risks. We continue to see the consolidation of panels and binding authority as a long-term growth opportunity and we remain well positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. Our underwriting management specialty performed very well in the quarter led by property and casualty and our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re. We are proud to deliver another year of increasing underwriting profitability for our carrier trading partners despite multiple adverse market events. We also look forward to the addition of Castel pending regulatory approval in the UK, which will add top decile talent, expand our international footprint, make us stronger in markets such as the UK and Europe, and position us well to accelerate our international expansion. As Pat mentioned, we made significant progress with respect to our acquisition strategy in 2023. Focused execution on the right transactions will enable us to further grow alongside our clients evolving needs and ensure our ability to sustainably grow our platform over the long term and perform over economic cycles. Turning to price. The hard market conditions, including firm or accelerating pricing have continued into early 2024 in the majority of our business lines. Exceptions remain in public company D&O and cyber. As we've noted before, in any cycle, as certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. That said, we still have yet to see this play out and the standard market has not meaningfully impacted rate or flow in the aggregate. We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty\u2019s growth more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our fourth quarter. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q4, we grew total revenue 22.5% period-over-period to $533 million, fueled by another strong quarter of organic growth at 16.0%, and contributions from M&A, which added over four percentage points to our top line. Growth was driven by the ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market, strong renewal, retention and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter grew 24.6% period-over-period to $159 million and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 50 basis points to 29.8%, driven by another quarter of strong revenue growth and higher fiduciary investment income, which was partially offset by continued investments in our business. Adjusted EPS grew 29.6% to $0.35 per share. Our full year 2023 results were excellent. For the year, we grew total revenue 20.4% to $2.1 billion, driven by organic growth of 15% and contributions from M&A, which added three percentage points to our top line. We grew full year adjusted EBITDA 20.7% to $625 million and expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 10 basis points to 30.1%. Adjusted EPS grew 20% to $1.38 per share. Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program, we had approximately $12 million in charges for the quarter and $48 million in charges for the year. We continue to expect cumulative special charges of approximately $90 million under this program and expect annual savings of approximately $50 million in 2025. We expect approximately half of these savings will be realized in 2024. As Pat noted in his remarks, M&A remains the top priority in terms of allocating capital. That said, as a result of the financial flexibility that our business model provides, the Board declared a one-time special cash dividend of $0.23 per share and initiated a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share on our outstanding Class A common stock. Both the special and regular quarterly dividend will be payable on March 27, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2024. More information on the attribution of the dividend can be found in our earnings release and will also be presented in our Q1 10-Q. As we initiate our dividend and add this new facet of capital management to our arsenal, it is important to note that we will continue to execute on our robust M&A pipeline, maintain our strong balance sheet and stay within our stated leverage corridors. We remain committed to being good stewards of capital both through our M&A strategy and our dividend policy in order to deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value. As Pat mentioned, we remain firmly committed to our successful long-term strategy. One, organically investing in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth. Two, executing on our disciplined M&A strategy with high quality acquisitions. And three, maintaining our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which create value for shareholders. Looking forward, we will continue making strategic investments in talent and recruitment. These investments in talent, particularly recruiting new colleagues, historically have offered the highest returns for our shareholders and are part of our proven approach to maintaining our long-term growth prospects. Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds and includes the recent repricing of our term loan of approximately $120 million in 2024. As Pat and Tim mentioned, we continue to be excited about our long-term growth opportunities and value proposition. As a result, we are guiding full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be between 12.0% and 13.5%. We believe our broad-based growth will be driven by our exceptional talent, including our outsized investments in 2022 and the benefits of prior year M&A as we lap 12 months of ownership, exactly as Pat has signaled in many of our prior calls. In addition, we are guiding adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2024 to be between 31.0% and 31.5%. We expect to recognize approximately half of the $50 million in annual run rate savings from ACCELERATE 2025 this year, with the majority of those savings falling to our bottom line. Those savings will be paired with a return to underlying annual margin expansion in our business. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2023 performance and remain excited for both our near- and long-term prospects. Our dynamic and differentiated business model continues to position us well to best serve our clients and to deliver the innovative solutions that our clients have come to expect as a hallmark of Ryan Specialty. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. My first question is on the organic growth outlook, right? So you're setting 2024 initially at 12% to 13.5%. If I go back 12 months ago, you would set this 2023 at 10% to 13%. So I know that's driven by several factors you outlined on the call, but it feels like you feel better about 2024 than you did at the start of 2023. Would you agree with that statement?\nJeremiah Bickham: Hi, Elyse. We feel very good not only about where we finished 2023, but also 2024. And we view 12% to 13% as a very healthy amount of growth. Now, when you're comparing it to 2023 and trying to understand if there's a trend, the biggest individual variable that explains the difference is really property. So we expect a really strong contribution from our property portfolio this year, as well as our casualty portfolio. However, we're not counting on the same compounding premium rate increases that we saw last year in property this year. But as I said, 12% to 13% still very healthy. And then when you pair that with up to 150 basis points of margin improvement and the contributions from last year's M&A and potential new M&A this year, I think it's easy to see why we're very excited about our overall growth prospects in 2024.\nElyse Greenspan: And then you guys were talking about the Castel deal, and you said that it helps with international expansion. You just give a sense, I mean, that brings on $44 million. But how do we think about just the international opportunity that you guys see and over what time period could that play out?\nPat Ryan: Well, we look at the international market as very much being ripe for delegated authority expansion. A lot of that comes from the consolidation of carriers over the last number of years, but also a need for innovation in the European market. We bring innovation. So we believe that planning the flag in Europe as we add to our already existing good business, the Castel talent that we'll get quick materialization of productivity improvements, and bringing innovative products to various European countries.\nElyse Greenspan: And then how big is Ryan Re today?\nPat Ryan: How big are they? Well, they're big.\nElyse Greenspan: Yes.\nPat Ryan: But we don't break it out. \nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. We don't disclose revenue or profitability at the individual MGU level, but it's a great example of innovation, a TAM expanding de novo [ph], a great partnership that we have with Nationwide and a really rapidly growing part of our MGU portfolio.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Mike Zaremski from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, great. First question on contingents and subs [ph] for the year. I don't know \u2013 I don't think I have the 4Q number, but it looks like for the year it's running a much higher percentage revenues than last year. Any thoughts, any guidance you want to offer us or just how to think about contingents and subs whether this is kind of 2023 was a normal year, better than normal year, or maybe the airlines you're growing in have a larger contribution from contingents and subs. Thanks.\nTim Turner: Look, we appreciate the question. So I think we perhaps highlighted in our last quarter that we've seen an emergence of profit commissions from even back years in the soft market parts of the cycle which are a great complement to the results we've driven. So we've seen results from past years. We believe we've delivered a lot of profit to carriers over the last several years which will continue to merge as profit commissions over the coming years. So that is part of our go forward planning process.\nPat Ryan: Of course, those are not an organic growth numbers. We don't put contingent positions, right.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Maybe pivoting back to the organic growth guidance, and you've given a lot of good breadcrumbs and just insights on the call so far, but if I just look at, just curious, if I look at the guidance range, it's tighter than you've given in previous years, which seems to kind of point to you have increased conviction over or just more predictability over your growth rate this year versus in previous years. Anything more you'd want to add about why you have more conviction other than you made a number of comments and you talked about property being a variable too, that you're counting on less this year.\nTim Turner: I think the simplest way to think about it, Mike, is just there's less variability, less material variability within the individual variables. So last year, for example, you had property, which it was hard to tell at the beginning of the year where it was going to end up, how long it was going to last, how much rate there was going to be. You had various headwinds across our professional lines and transaction liability. There's still a lot of moving pieces and a lot of things in play, but there is \u2013 it's more of an aggregation of a bunch of, call it normal variables that make us feel comfortable guiding towards a tighter range. That doesn't mean that that's what we'll go out with every year, but this year it felt in all the scenarios that we ran in our bottom up budgeting process, we got comfortable with 150 basis point range.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And just lastly, it sounds like still optimistic on M&A. Could the pace of M&A in 2024 be similar to that of the pace in 2023?\nPat Ryan: Well, as you know, it takes a long time to cultivate a lot of these great companies that were able to buy. I would comment that in terms of people that are ready or getting ready to sell, there has been an uptick. So it's a matter of determining when they are available and can we get together on reasonable terms. As we said, we have a very robust pipeline. We had quite a good year in M&A last year. We can't predict how \u2013 when they fall. It's got so many variables. But just rest assured that there's more opportunity in 2024 than there was entering 2024 than there was entering 2023.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is now live.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks so much. I have one question sort of stemming from a Castel deal, and I don't want to extrapolate too much from one point. But should we think of there being behind the scenes mounting interest in underwriters divesting MGUs?\nTim Turner: Just to make sure I heard the question, you said, are there \u2013 should we assume that there's mounting interest in carriers divesting MGUs?\nMeyer Shields: Yes \u2013 or I don't know whether this is just a one-off deal. Obviously, it takes time for deals to close, but I don't know if there's a broader team that we should be thinking about in the context of potential M&A.\nPat Ryan: Well, this is just our opinion. Carriers as well as banks seen that they need tangible net worth in their businesses and they've had \u2013 banks have had strategy to own brokers with lots of intangible value. They have certainly been carriers in that same situation. There is \u2013 I don't know if you can call it a trend, but let's say that, in fact, more carriers are realizing that getting the tangible book is superior to managing the delegated authority opportunity. I don't want to call it a trend, but it certainly is happening now.\nMeyer Shields: No, that's very helpful. Thank you. The second question is, broadly speaking, with regard to recruiting, I was hoping for an update on what we could think of as sort of the war for talent or just battle for talent, whether pricing for good brokerage talent is intensifying or abating compared to 6 or 12 months ago?\nTim Turner: Hi, Meyer. I would certainly say this, from day one and through our history, we've been very, very focused on attracting the highest caliber decile talent in broking and underwriting and we've never let up. It's been a big part of our success. It's a limited supply of high-caliber underwriters and brokers. We know who they are, and we've been very successful at bringing them in and attracting them to Ryan Specialty. We'll continue to do that. It's been a big part of our success across the country and the environment for recruiting has never been better.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. And if I can throw in one last one. I know that public company D&O remains something of a headwind. Is that changing at all? Are the headwinds fading?\nTim Turner: The headwinds continue, but I think we're through the pain phase. The books have rolled over and converted and we're back to being in a pretty strong position across all ProExec lines, including D&O and E&O. Public D&O, it remains a challenge. It's a softer part of ProExec today, but I think the actual movement of the business and the transition of that business, we've been through most of it. And I expect that line to really stabilize and continue to grow. There is firming niches in ProExec, like healthcare, social and human services, we're getting a real big tailwind in those classes.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, excellent. Thank you so much for all the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Rob Cox from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.\nRob Cox: Hi, thanks. So one of the areas that's been particularly strong relative to some of the public peers we look at is binding authority. And I know you guys don't exactly give the organic there and the business mix is a bit different from those peers. But maybe you could elaborate on what's been the driver of what's been exceptional growth there.\nTim Turner: Sure, Rob. Small commercial, not to be misconstrued as easy, those are tough. Property and casualty accounts are just small. We've been keen on building this binding authority up underneath the RT chassis, if you will. So in all the different offices, our hub and spoke approach to the business, the brokerage platforms of RT have these burgeoning binding authority platforms, and they're gaining momentum. The customer base, who trust us with their brokerage property and casualty business, is moving more binding authority business to us. RFTs for the consolidation of binding authority business continue to be a strong tailwind for us. And our electronic trading platform, our technology approach to the business is working extremely well, and we're getting a lot more momentum in the speed and the efficiency at which we can grow small commercial. So we're very, very bullish on the long runway ahead in growing our binding authority business.\nRob Cox: Thanks. And as a follow-up on the margin guide, so that the $25 million in 2024 seems like it will add 100 basis points of the 100 to 150 basis points expansion or so that you guys have identified. Could you help us think about the puts and takes of the margin excluding the restructuring impact?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. So Rob, you're absolutely right. The, call it, 25 round savings from ACCELERATE that's flowing through this year does do most of the heavy lifting to get us into the beginning of our range, the 31%. But remember, that's being paired with resuming a return to underlying annual scaling. And where we ultimately shake out will depend on how organic growth materializes for the year, what other growth investments arise and then also what \u2013 Fed does. So right now, our plan contemplates overcoming a headwind in fiduciary investment income. But if the Fed cuts deeper and faster, that will obviously have an impact. And then alternatively, if rates hold throughout the year, that could be a tailwind for margin. But big picture though, I mean, the progress of ACCELERATE 2025 and the impact that it's having on our margin this year, the impact that it will have on our margin in future years and the fact that we're resuming annual underlying scaling is incredibly exciting for us and then pairing that big jump in earnings power with our exceptional top line growth is even more exciting, and we're far from done on both of those fronts.\nRob Cox: Thanks. That's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Bill Carcache from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.\nBill Carcache: Thank you. Good afternoon. Following up on your delegated underwriting authority comments. Can you take us inside some of the discussions that you're having with clients regarding your capabilities? In an environment where there is significant performance disparity across MGAs and MGUs, how is your performance track record contributing to the discussions? And maybe what's your success rate in competing for the business with top docile talents seems like it should be quite strong, but any color around sort of the discussions would be extremely helpful.\nPat Ryan: Yes. Look, I appreciate the question. We're definitely proud of our 2023 performance and the momentum going into 2024. So strong growth, product expansion, and most importantly, as you highlighted another year of increasing profitability to carriers. So kind of like your industry, our track record in individual product classes is important to attracting new capital. And it's equally important in showing that past performance when it comes to launching new products. So we've had a lot of success increasing underwriting capital under management last year. Last year, we grew premium in products with a greater majority of our top 25 partners, a strategy that I feel we've led the way on that had success continuing into last year was we were able to achieve several portfolio-wide arrangements where key capital partners are supporting a broad-based selection of our products. We believe the same as possible as we go into 2024. Big picture, we \u2013 the penetration of delegated authority is increasing across the marketplace, but it's still early doors, and we remain a relatively small percentage of total premium wallet, a lot of these major global carriers, and we aspire to perpetuate this performance into 2024.\nBill Carcache: That's helpful. Thank you. Separately, the risk of E&S business migrating back to the admitted markets is very much in focus, and I appreciate your comments in the prepared remarks. But are there any tangible examples you could point to or that you would point to as posing outsized risk?\nTim Turner: Well, the migration of business back into the standard market is very, very modest. In most high hazard classes of business in property and casualty, it's double-digit growth. The dumping and the shedding continues especially in classes of business like transportation and healthcare, loss leaders in the reinsurance world, that business continues to grow double digit in our space. So we don't really see a lot of migration back into the standard market at all, that's measurable. A little bit of business kind of heading back into the London market, but hardly measurable. The London market has been a little bit more aggressive but we use that market as well, but again, nothing measurable that we can see.\nBill Carcache: Understood, thank you. And if I may squeeze in one last one. How are expectations of Fed rate cuts influencing your discussions with potential targets? Do you sense a greater inclination to wait in anticipation of selling into a more attractive environment? I\u2019m just curious whether the discussions are sort of being influenced by the \u2013 how they\u2019re being influenced by the current rate environment?\nPat Ryan: Well, I think it depends on the quality of the business that you\u2019re targeting. We target very high-quality businesses and people know that they are high quality and they are not anxious to take a haircut on that because of the market conditions. You saw just recently the announcement on Truist Insurance Holdings, that\u2019s been announced at a pretty high multiple, because it\u2019s the high-quality business. There are businesses that deservedly have earned a lower multiple and not necessarily because they\u2019re bad businesses at all, but there could be some disruptions that temporarily lowered their performance. And so there are good companies out there that we could \u2013 we believe, bring in at lower multiples than the past, but they need a little bit of productivity improvement, we call it, but we\u2019re quite good at that. So as we look at the opportunities out there, likely, there are some quite good companies that need a little, let\u2019s say, a new home, and some productivity help and some distribution help. And we think we can get some quite good attractive companies at reasonable multiples.\nBill Carcache: That\u2019s very helpful Pat. Thanks everyone for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Mike Ward from Citi. Your line is now live.\nMike Ward: Thanks guys. Maybe just following up on Rob\u2019s question, NII, how much of a headwind are you embedding? Are you assuming rate cuts?\nJeremiah Bickham: We are. We look at the forward curve to set our budgets, and it\u2019s changed the assumption of I think it was five cuts a month ago. It\u2019s three cuts that are embedded in the forward curve now. So, we\u2019re taking into account a range of outcomes and all of the scenarios in our models our headwind. And like I said, we\u2019re very happy that our plan has us overcoming them.\nMike Ward: Okay, thanks. And then just kind of curious what you are expecting in terms of property rate increases with respect to organic growth guidance? And I guess a similar question for casualty.\nTim Turner: Well, we\u2019ll start with property. First of all, the flow into the channel continues to be double digit. So, we continue to see a lot of business being moved into the non-admitted market. And we\u2019re seeing double-digit rate increases on cat property. So whether it\u2019s coastal wind, wildfire, flood, convective storm business, predominantly what we see, there is double-digit rate increase continuing. Very little rate deceleration, very modest. In casualty, again, double-digit growth flow into the channel, stamping offices, the larger states have validated that once again. That kind of ebbs and flows depending on the narrow niches of high hazard business that we play in, but your usual strong classes of business like transportation, habitational, large venue risks, higher education, sports and entertainment, health care, social and human service business continues to flow into our channel. So we are very well set up, as you know, with heavy brokerage, talent, deep bench and our underwriting platforms that are woven into these practice group verticals. We expect 2024 to be very strong.\nMike Ward: Awesome, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is coming from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your line is now live.\nRyan Tunis: Hi. I guess just following up on that last question. You said that you are seeing solid rate in property, not much deceleration. But if I recall all of those cat-exposed property lines for new midyear. So how much \u2013 do you guys really have that much visibility on what\u2019s going to happen from a pricing standpoint and property in 2024 at this juncture?\nTim Turner: We don\u2019t. But what we can see so far is that the rates continue to increase. There has been, again, a very slight, hardly even measurable deceleration on certain classes of business. But again, we\u2019re talking specifically about E&S high-hazard cat property and that \u2013 certainly not middle market or mainstream property business that does, in fact, have rate deceleration. So again, the overall high hazard part of our property continues to be very, very strong.\nRyan Tunis: And then I mean you\u2019re still bullish, I guess, on property submissions. Can you just help me understand where incremental submissions come from? So 2022 happened, we had a huge hurricane like just about everything coastal admitted and non-admitted market. I\u2019m not disagreeing that it\u2019s going to stay there, but where is the incremental submission flow come from?\nTim Turner: Well, first of all, treaty reinsurance plays a big role here and limited capacity being produced by large risk-bearing companies, whether it\u2019s here or Europe or Lloyd\u2019s, London, shrinking lines much, much smaller net line capacity available for the cat business. So it requires a higher number of participants to deliver on the limits that are required. So, our non-admitted capacity even in smaller tranches is needed in a much \u2013 there is a much higher demand for that in accomplishing these limits that are needed. We don\u2019t see a lot up in that. There is no one putting up big lines in cat property. It\u2019s much more the other way. So, the new opportunities are really restructuring these towers and requiring, again, that expertise and more carriers to participate to accomplish the goals.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And I guess just one last one with the contingent of the profit commissions. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s accounted for. But is there a noise that you see there from, I don\u2019t know, maybe you got paid for something in casualty, 15 to 19 [ph] and now it\u2019s developing more adversely. Is there a clawback mechanism for that, or is that not really a dynamic?\nMiles Wuller: So Ryan, on this technical accounting side, there is no clawback on anything we book. We only book it when it\u2019s fully earned and collected we don\u2019t want any downside to what you\u2019re seeing. I think broadly speaking, on average, it takes three or four years on average for a profit commission to be earned recognized, measured and paid. So, as I think I said in the opening, we\u2019re pleased to see PCs materialize from some of the soft market years of four or five years ago, and we are optimistic of our underwriting performance that will materialize in PCs in the coming several years. But again, at the heart of your question, there are no clawbacks in what you\u2019re seeing on our books.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.\nPat Ryan: Okay. Well, thank you. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today and certainly for your continued support of our firm. And we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter, and probably we\u2019ll be talking to several of you between now and then. Thanks for your interest and support.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference and webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.",

            "content": "Thank you, Tim. In Q4, we grew total revenue 22.5% period-over-period to $533 million, fueled by another strong quarter of organic growth at 16.0%, and contributions from M&A, which added over four percentage points to our top line. Growth was driven by the ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market, strong renewal, retention and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter grew 24.6% period-over-period to $159 million and adjusted EBITDA margin improved 50 basis points to 29.8%, driven by another quarter of strong revenue growth and higher fiduciary investment income, which was partially offset by continued investments in our business. Adjusted EPS grew 29.6% to $0.35 per share. Our full year 2023 results were excellent. For the year, we grew total revenue 20.4% to $2.1 billion, driven by organic growth of 15% and contributions from M&A, which added three percentage points to our top line. We grew full year adjusted EBITDA 20.7% to $625 million and expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 10 basis points to 30.1%. Adjusted EPS grew 20% to $1.38 per share. Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program, we had approximately $12 million in charges for the quarter and $48 million in charges for the year. We continue to expect cumulative special charges of approximately $90 million under this program and expect annual savings of approximately $50 million in 2025. We expect approximately half of these savings will be realized in 2024. As Pat noted in his remarks, M&A remains the top priority in terms of allocating capital. That said, as a result of the financial flexibility that our business model provides, the Board declared a one-time special cash dividend of $0.23 per share and initiated a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share on our outstanding Class A common stock. Both the special and regular quarterly dividend will be payable on March 27, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2024. More information on the attribution of the dividend can be found in our earnings release and will also be presented in our Q1 10-Q. As we initiate our dividend and add this new facet of capital management to our arsenal, it is important to note that we will continue to execute on our robust M&A pipeline, maintain our strong balance sheet and stay within our stated leverage corridors. We remain committed to being good stewards of capital both through our M&A strategy and our dividend policy in order to deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value. As Pat mentioned, we remain firmly committed to our successful long-term strategy. One, organically investing in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth. Two, executing on our disciplined M&A strategy with high quality acquisitions. And three, maintaining our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which create value for shareholders. Looking forward, we will continue making strategic investments in talent and recruitment. These investments in talent, particularly recruiting new colleagues, historically have offered the highest returns for our shareholders and are part of our proven approach to maintaining our long-term growth prospects. Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds and includes the recent repricing of our term loan of approximately $120 million in 2024. As Pat and Tim mentioned, we continue to be excited about our long-term growth opportunities and value proposition. As a result, we are guiding full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be between 12.0% and 13.5%. We believe our broad-based growth will be driven by our exceptional talent, including our outsized investments in 2022 and the benefits of prior year M&A as we lap 12 months of ownership, exactly as Pat has signaled in many of our prior calls. In addition, we are guiding adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2024 to be between 31.0% and 31.5%. We expect to recognize approximately half of the $50 million in annual run rate savings from ACCELERATE 2025 this year, with the majority of those savings falling to our bottom line. Those savings will be paired with a return to underlying annual margin expansion in our business. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2023 performance and remain excited for both our near- and long-term prospects. Our dynamic and differentiated business model continues to position us well to best serve our clients and to deliver the innovative solutions that our clients have come to expect as a hallmark of Ryan Specialty. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Hi, Elyse. We feel very good not only about where we finished 2023, but also 2024. And we view 12% to 13% as a very healthy amount of growth. Now, when you're comparing it to 2023 and trying to understand if there's a trend, the biggest individual variable that explains the difference is really property. So we expect a really strong contribution from our property portfolio this year, as well as our casualty portfolio. However, we're not counting on the same compounding premium rate increases that we saw last year in property this year. But as I said, 12% to 13% still very healthy. And then when you pair that with up to 150 basis points of margin improvement and the contributions from last year's M&A and potential new M&A this year, I think it's easy to see why we're very excited about our overall growth prospects in 2024. Yes. We don't disclose revenue or profitability at the individual MGU level, but it's a great example of innovation, a TAM expanding de novo [ph], a great partnership that we have with Nationwide and a really rapidly growing part of our MGU portfolio. Yes. So Rob, you're absolutely right. The, call it, 25 round savings from ACCELERATE that's flowing through this year does do most of the heavy lifting to get us into the beginning of our range, the 31%. But remember, that's being paired with resuming a return to underlying annual scaling. And where we ultimately shake out will depend on how organic growth materializes for the year, what other growth investments arise and then also what \u2013 Fed does. So right now, our plan contemplates overcoming a headwind in fiduciary investment income. But if the Fed cuts deeper and faster, that will obviously have an impact. And then alternatively, if rates hold throughout the year, that could be a tailwind for margin. But big picture though, I mean, the progress of ACCELERATE 2025 and the impact that it's having on our margin this year, the impact that it will have on our margin in future years and the fact that we're resuming annual underlying scaling is incredibly exciting for us and then pairing that big jump in earnings power with our exceptional top line growth is even more exciting, and we're far from done on both of those fronts. We are. We look at the forward curve to set our budgets, and it's changed the assumption of I think it was five cuts a month ago. It's three cuts that are embedded in the forward curve now. So, we're taking into account a range of outcomes and all of the scenarios in our models our headwind. And like I said, we're very happy that our plan has us overcoming them."

            "name": "Pat Ryan",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results. With me on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; and our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller. Also with us is our Director of Investor Relations, Nick Mezick. 2023 was another outstanding year for Ryan Specialty. Our team continues to excel with the steadfast efforts to deliver top quality service to our clients. Through a combination of industry-leading talent and dedication to our clients, we generated another year of strong results while making long-term sustainable investments in our business to fortify our competitive position. For the full year, we surpassed revenues of $2 billion, up 20.4% year-over-year, driven by organic growth of 15% on top of the 16.4% in 2022. We also had a meaningful contribution from recent M&A. We grew full year adjusted EBITDAC 20.7% to $625 million and expanded adjusted EBITDAC margins by 10 basis points to 30.1%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 20% to $1.38. We also successfully executed on our strategy to add to our total addressable market. Our overall strategy is aligned around serving the evolving and growing needs of our clients in order to provide a dynamic value proposition. For a double-digit organic growth engine, and our M&A strategy, we are steadily expanding our total addressable market within specialty insurance, particularly with targeted investments and dedicated authority, benefits, alternative risks as well as deepening our considerable moat by enhancing our scale, scope and intellectual capital. 2023 marked the second best year for M&A, only topped in 2020 when we acquired All Risks. We successfully completed and announced several acquisitions with annual historic revenue totaling in excess of $140 million, adding and integrating new capabilities to each of our three specialties. Griffin Underwriting Services broadened our geographic scope and capabilities and our binding authority in brokerage specialties. Our Socius Insurance Services deepened our scale in our key urban centers and added a high-quality talent to our Professional Lines, Cyber Liability and Property Teams. ACE, Point6 and AccuRisk, provided foundational capabilities for our employee benefits, distribution and underwriting platform and are rapidly developing new products and service offerings to help our clients with integrated health solutions. In late December, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Castel Underwriting Agencies, which is anticipated to close in the first half of this year. We expect the Castel team to add approximately $44 million of annual revenue. Castel adds top talent and differentiated intellectual capital through 13 unique MGUs and has an excellent track record of delivering strong underwriting profits to its capital providers. Our geographic focus in the UK and Europe will significantly expand our international footprint, and we expect our management team and operations to be a catalyst for new delegated underwriting authority start-ups and accelerated international expansion. Further, we've developed new proprietary products and capabilities and underwriting management with multiple transportation facilities, and [indiscernible] Verdant, our high net worth MGU, offering coastal wind and wildfire coverage to a highly dislocated homeowners insurance market. In addition, several of our MGUs have expanded geographically in the UK, Canada and Singapore, growing our global footprint and expanding our total addressable market. In particular, we're excited about Perse International, our wind and solar property MGU with a recent launch in the UK. Stepping back, our delegated authority specialties are well positioned to execute on both organic and inorganic opportunities. Our offering to carriers is stronger than ever, built through investment in top talent and a heavily resourced platform, which includes actuarial and IT support as well as broad-based distribution. Our market position is further strengthened by our ability to retain our talent through our culture of empowerment, innovation and client centricity. We share a like-minded view of risk and partnership with our carriers as demonstrated by our excellent track record of underwriting results. We are confident that our investment in people and the platform will help ensure our ability to sustainably grow our value proposition over the longer term and perform well through economic cycles. Turning to talent. We made strategic investments in talent in 2023 to further strengthen our capabilities in both current and developing lines of business on the back of onboarding our largest production class in history in 2022. Collectively, these investments in talent are well on track to meaningfully contribute to our future performance. As we've noted previously, they are a key part of our proven winning formula to maintain and strengthen our long-term growth prospects. We were pleased to finish the year once again with industry-leading producer retention. While we have been successful at onboarding key talent, it's equally important to maintain a winning empowering culture that ensures our top producers remain at our firm. We continue to succeed on that front. It is both the exceptional quality and quantity of talent that distinguishes Ryan Specialty from the rest of the industry. We remain dedicated to recruiting, training and developing large teams of talent from college hires to experienced brokers and underwriters. As a result of our efforts, we accelerate the learning curve of these individuals, which helps them compete at the highest level. Our clients consistently emphasize that it's our differentiated talent that ensures they can trust us to solve their most challenging problems. Our commitment to onboarding and retaining the best and most innovative talent and our emphasis on delivering value for our clients has been vital to our mission since our founding. This is why we continue to generate industry-leading organic growth and why we believe we can successfully sustain these levels of growth over the long-term. Turning to capital allocation, M&A remains our top priority, and we entered the year with significant momentum. We are cultivating a wealth of opportunities. And as market conditions are improving, we have an ambitious M&A outlook for 2024. We continue to see substantial M&A opportunities that we expect will bolster our organic growth engine. Our M&A pipeline remains robust and includes both tuck-ins and potential large deals. As we've consistently noted, we will only move forward when all of our criteria for M&A are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. Additionally, given our broad financial flexibility, we are pleased to initiate a quarterly dividend program to return capital and create additional value for our shareholders. But assisted by our Board to initiate the cash dividend program reflects confidence in our ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth, generate strong cash flow over the long-term and execute on a robust M&A program. It is also a testament of our ability to be excellent stewards of capital for our investors as we believe we can both seamlessly execute on our robust M&A pipeline for years to come and distribute dividends to our shareholders. We remain firmly committed to our successful long-term strategy. One, organically investing in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth; two, executing on our disciplined M&A strategy with high-quality acquisitions; and three, maintaining our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which create value for our shareholders. As we progress through 2024, there are four things you can continue to expect from Ryan Specialty. First, we expect to generate another year of double-digit organic growth, driven by secular growth factors and the strategies we are pursuing. Secular growth drivers like retail brokers becoming larger through solid organic growth and ongoing industry consolidation, retail brokers pursuing panel consolidation for both open market wholesale and delegated authority in order to have fewer more sophisticated counterparties who have the necessary scale to meet their needs. We believe that we are one of very few specialty insurance firms that meet those criteria. The world is continuing to increase in risk and complexity. This is driving more risks and new exposures into the E&S marketplace, which offers significantly more freedom of rate and form and therefore, able to provide solutions that otherwise are not available. We believe the E&S market will keep growing and consistently outpace growth in the admitted market, overshadowing any cyclical shifts in certain lines with respect to submission flow and pricing. This is further aided by changes in distribution trends with a growing number of wholesale-only E&S carriers in the marketplace. Adding to these secular growth drivers is our unique competitive position in high-growth businesses, the expansion of our total addressable market and our ability to innovate with new product development, all of which serve to bolster our organic growth engine. We remain confident that these ongoing trends are sustainable and will continue to support our growth for the foreseeable future. Second, we will continue to grow through M&A. As mentioned earlier, we are steadily expanding our total addressable market within specialty insurance, including in delegated authority, alternative risks, benefits and deepening our considerable moat by enhancing our scale, scope and intellectual capital. We will complete the integration of our 2023 acquisitions and onboard the great team from Castel. Further, we will help these firms grow on our platform through our broad distribution network, access to our proprietary products and our deep carrier relationships. Third, we will continue to thoughtfully invest in our business. We expect another year of strategic hiring of top industry talent across our specialties. And we'll make additional investments in our systems and operations to ensure we remain at the forefront of the industry. Lastly, we will continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Notably, we will execute on our ACCELERATE 2025 program, driving continued growth and innovation, delivering sustainable productivity improvements over the long term and accelerating our margin improvement. As a reminder, we expect to generate annual savings of approximately $50 million in 2025 for some of the savings to be realized in 2024. With our flexible and differentiated business model, unparalleled expertise, innovation and work out that our clients and trading partners value, we are well positioned for another strong year in 2024. In summary, I remain incredibly proud of our entire team who are delivering another year of outstanding results and adding value for our clients, trading partners and ultimately, our shareholders. Now I am pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim? Well, we look at the international market as very much being ripe for delegated authority expansion. A lot of that comes from the consolidation of carriers over the last number of years, but also a need for innovation in the European market. We bring innovation. So we believe that planning the flag in Europe as we add to our already existing good business, the Castel talent that we'll get quick materialization of productivity improvements, and bringing innovative products to various European countries. How big are they? Well, they're big. But we don't break it out. Of course, those are not an organic growth numbers. We don't put contingent positions, right. Well, as you know, it takes a long time to cultivate a lot of these great companies that were able to buy. I would comment that in terms of people that are ready or getting ready to sell, there has been an uptick. So it's a matter of determining when they are available and can we get together on reasonable terms. As we said, we have a very robust pipeline. We had quite a good year in M&A last year. We can't predict how \u2013 when they fall. It's got so many variables. But just rest assured that there's more opportunity in 2024 than there was entering 2024 than there was entering 2023. Well, this is just our opinion. Carriers as well as banks seen that they need tangible net worth in their businesses and they've had \u2013 banks have had strategy to own brokers with lots of intangible value. They have certainly been carriers in that same situation. There is \u2013 I don't know if you can call it a trend, but let's say that, in fact, more carriers are realizing that getting the tangible book is superior to managing the delegated authority opportunity. I don't want to call it a trend, but it certainly is happening now. Yes. Look, I appreciate the question. We're definitely proud of our 2023 performance and the momentum going into 2024. So strong growth, product expansion, and most importantly, as you highlighted another year of increasing profitability to carriers. So kind of like your industry, our track record in individual product classes is important to attracting new capital. And it's equally important in showing that past performance when it comes to launching new products. So we've had a lot of success increasing underwriting capital under management last year. Last year, we grew premium in products with a greater majority of our top 25 partners, a strategy that I feel we've led the way on that had success continuing into last year was we were able to achieve several portfolio-wide arrangements where key capital partners are supporting a broad-based selection of our products. We believe the same as possible as we go into 2024. Big picture, we \u2013 the penetration of delegated authority is increasing across the marketplace, but it's still early doors, and we remain a relatively small percentage of total premium wallet, a lot of these major global carriers, and we aspire to perpetuate this performance into 2024. Well, I think it depends on the quality of the business that you're targeting. We target very high-quality businesses and people know that they are high quality and they are not anxious to take a haircut on that because of the market conditions. You saw just recently the announcement on Truist Insurance Holdings, that's been announced at a pretty high multiple, because it's the high-quality business. There are businesses that deservedly have earned a lower multiple and not necessarily because they're bad businesses at all, but there could be some disruptions that temporarily lowered their performance. And so there are good companies out there that we could \u2013 we believe, bring in at lower multiples than the past, but they need a little bit of productivity improvement, we call it, but we're quite good at that. So as we look at the opportunities out there, likely, there are some quite good companies that need a little, let's say, a new home, and some productivity help and some distribution help. And we think we can get some quite good attractive companies at reasonable multiples. Okay. Well, thank you. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today and certainly for your continued support of our firm. And we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter, and probably we'll be talking to several of you between now and then. Thanks for your interest and support."

            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. The fourth quarter capped off an excellent 2023 for Ryan Specialty as we generated another quarter of double-digit growth across all our specialties. Turning to the market, ongoing industry trends persist or are accelerating, notably an increasingly complex climate and legal environment marked by nuclear verdicts, accelerating social inflation, rising uncertainty regarding reserve adequacy and a pullback in risk appetite from the admitted market. These trends are driving more risks into the E&S marketplace, which is better able to handle a more uncertain environment as it offers significantly more freedom of rate in form and the ability for insurers and underwriters to adjust more quickly. As a result, the E&S market is seeing a consistent flow of risks as it is able to provide critical solutions that would otherwise not be available. This continues to create fantastic opportunities for our specialized and industry-leading teams to provide solutions on behalf of our clients. Diving into our specialties, our wholesale brokerage specialty generated another quarter of strong growth. In property, elevated loss activity, including $50 billion of insured losses from severe convective storms, higher reinsurance costs and retentions of risk, persistent inflation and ongoing focus on insurance to value make for a challenging market. These factors are continuing to drive flow of new business into the E&S market. We continue to see the E&S market respond well, yet with continued discipline and tighter limit management especially around coastal property, wildfire and flood, along with increased concern of earthquake risk. Given heightened frequency and severity of property losses, particularly in coastal areas, and more recently in the Midwest, we believe risks will remain in the E&S market. This will drive recurring opportunities for talented experts to deliver critical solutions to our trading partners and placing these complex risks. We believe property should continue to be a strong driver of growth for Ryan Specialty in 2024, driven by sustained flow into the channel and continued yet more stabilizing rate increases. Our casualty practice had another strong quarter, driven by flow into the E&S market in both primary and excess casualty, particularly for habitational risks, health care, transportation, sports and entertainment and consumer products. Our transportation practice saw another quarter of strong flow difficult loss trends driven by both economic and severe social inflation are driving carrier need for continued rate increases, a pullback in underwriter appetite and market exits. These casualty classes are experiencing higher loss trends driven by economic and social inflation reserving issues due to the long tail nature and latency in claims, plus higher reinsurance costs. With our world class technical expertise and deep bench, we are perfectly positioned to execute and deliver value for our clients, particularly in a more unpredictable market. We are optimistic that casualty will be a strong contributor to our 2024 performance. Overall, it was a great year for our wholesale brokerage specialty. The team remains committed to delivering innovative strategies and products to meet the ever changing needs of the marketplace for our clients and we are well positioned to generate consistent, profitable growth. Now, turning to our delegated authority specialties which include both binding and underwriting management. Our binding authority specialty had another excellent quarter driven by key contributions from our high caliber talent and new proprietary products which make for a seamless experience for our clients on small but tough to place commercial P&C risks. We continue to see the consolidation of panels and binding authority as a long-term growth opportunity and we remain well positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. Our underwriting management specialty performed very well in the quarter led by property and casualty and our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re. We are proud to deliver another year of increasing underwriting profitability for our carrier trading partners despite multiple adverse market events. We also look forward to the addition of Castel pending regulatory approval in the UK, which will add top decile talent, expand our international footprint, make us stronger in markets such as the UK and Europe, and position us well to accelerate our international expansion. As Pat mentioned, we made significant progress with respect to our acquisition strategy in 2023. Focused execution on the right transactions will enable us to further grow alongside our clients evolving needs and ensure our ability to sustainably grow our platform over the long term and perform over economic cycles. Turning to price. The hard market conditions, including firm or accelerating pricing have continued into early 2024 in the majority of our business lines. Exceptions remain in public company D&O and cyber. As we've noted before, in any cycle, as certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. That said, we still have yet to see this play out and the standard market has not meaningfully impacted rate or flow in the aggregate. We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our fourth quarter. Thank you. Look, we appreciate the question. So I think we perhaps highlighted in our last quarter that we've seen an emergence of profit commissions from even back years in the soft market parts of the cycle which are a great complement to the results we've driven. So we've seen results from past years. We believe we've delivered a lot of profit to carriers over the last several years which will continue to merge as profit commissions over the coming years. So that is part of our go forward planning process. I think the simplest way to think about it, Mike, is just there's less variability, less material variability within the individual variables. So last year, for example, you had property, which it was hard to tell at the beginning of the year where it was going to end up, how long it was going to last, how much rate there was going to be. You had various headwinds across our professional lines and transaction liability. There's still a lot of moving pieces and a lot of things in play, but there is \u2013 it's more of an aggregation of a bunch of, call it normal variables that make us feel comfortable guiding towards a tighter range. That doesn't mean that that's what we'll go out with every year, but this year it felt in all the scenarios that we ran in our bottom up budgeting process, we got comfortable with 150 basis point range. Just to make sure I heard the question, you said, are there \u2013 should we assume that there's mounting interest in carriers divesting MGUs? Hi, Meyer. I would certainly say this, from day one and through our history, we've been very, very focused on attracting the highest caliber decile talent in broking and underwriting and we've never let up. It's been a big part of our success. It's a limited supply of high-caliber underwriters and brokers. We know who they are, and we've been very successful at bringing them in and attracting them to Ryan Specialty. We'll continue to do that. It's been a big part of our success across the country and the environment for recruiting has never been better. The headwinds continue, but I think we're through the pain phase. The books have rolled over and converted and we're back to being in a pretty strong position across all ProExec lines, including D&O and E&O. Public D&O, it remains a challenge. It's a softer part of ProExec today, but I think the actual movement of the business and the transition of that business, we've been through most of it. And I expect that line to really stabilize and continue to grow. There is firming niches in ProExec, like healthcare, social and human services, we're getting a real big tailwind in those classes. Sure, Rob. Small commercial, not to be misconstrued as easy, those are tough. Property and casualty accounts are just small. We've been keen on building this binding authority up underneath the RT chassis, if you will. So in all the different offices, our hub and spoke approach to the business, the brokerage platforms of RT have these burgeoning binding authority platforms, and they're gaining momentum. The customer base, who trust us with their brokerage property and casualty business, is moving more binding authority business to us. RFTs for the consolidation of binding authority business continue to be a strong tailwind for us. And our electronic trading platform, our technology approach to the business is working extremely well, and we're getting a lot more momentum in the speed and the efficiency at which we can grow small commercial. So we're very, very bullish on the long runway ahead in growing our binding authority business. Well, the migration of business back into the standard market is very, very modest. In most high hazard classes of business in property and casualty, it's double-digit growth. The dumping and the shedding continues especially in classes of business like transportation and healthcare, loss leaders in the reinsurance world, that business continues to grow double digit in our space. So we don't really see a lot of migration back into the standard market at all, that's measurable. A little bit of business kind of heading back into the London market, but hardly measurable. The London market has been a little bit more aggressive but we use that market as well, but again, nothing measurable that we can see. Well, we'll start with property. First of all, the flow into the channel continues to be double digit. So, we continue to see a lot of business being moved into the non-admitted market. And we're seeing double-digit rate increases on cat property. So whether it's coastal wind, wildfire, flood, convective storm business, predominantly what we see, there is double-digit rate increase continuing. Very little rate deceleration, very modest. In casualty, again, double-digit growth flow into the channel, stamping offices, the larger states have validated that once again. That kind of ebbs and flows depending on the narrow niches of high hazard business that we play in, but your usual strong classes of business like transportation, habitational, large venue risks, higher education, sports and entertainment, health care, social and human service business continues to flow into our channel. So we are very well set up, as you know, with heavy brokerage, talent, deep bench and our underwriting platforms that are woven into these practice group verticals. We expect 2024 to be very strong. We don't. But what we can see so far is that the rates continue to increase. There has been, again, a very slight, hardly even measurable deceleration on certain classes of business. But again, we're talking specifically about E&S high-hazard cat property and that \u2013 certainly not middle market or mainstream property business that does, in fact, have rate deceleration. So again, the overall high hazard part of our property continues to be very, very strong. Well, first of all, treaty reinsurance plays a big role here and limited capacity being produced by large risk-bearing companies, whether it's here or Europe or Lloyd's, London, shrinking lines much, much smaller net line capacity available for the cat business. So it requires a higher number of participants to deliver on the limits that are required. So, our non-admitted capacity even in smaller tranches is needed in a much \u2013 there is a much higher demand for that in accomplishing these limits that are needed. We don't see a lot up in that. There is no one putting up big lines in cat property. It's much more the other way. So, the new opportunities are really restructuring these towers and requiring, again, that expertise and more carriers to participate to accomplish the goals."

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryan Specialty, Pat Ryan.\nPatrick Ryan: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. With me on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham, our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller. Also with us is our Head of Investor Relations, Nick Mezick. Ryan Specialty had another strong quarter as we continued to successfully execute on our strategic, financial and operational objectives. We grew total revenue of 21.8% and by organic growth of 14.7%. We saw broad-based strength across our specialties and in various lines of business, as well as strong contributions from our recent acquisitions was notably Socius. This quarter is a great example of how strategic M&A contributes to total revenue growth and will contribute to organic growth in future years. We also generated double-digit growth in both adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. I'm very pleased with our results as the entire Ryan Specialty team continues to perform at a high level and further validate our differentiated business model. Along with our excellent results, I'm excited to note that we continue to execute on our M&A strategy. Before diving into the details, I want to reiterate how we think about M&A. Our M&A strategy is aligned around the evolving and growing needs of our clients in order to create a dynamic value proposition. Our focus is on M&A opportunities with the highest quality specialty distributors, including wholesale, delegated authority and employee benefits. We are building out our alternative risk strategy by structuring solutions beyond traditional insurance placements to support our clients and the needs of the insurer fee for P&C or employee benefit strategies. Through this M&A strategy that we are steadily expanding our total addressable market within specialty insurance and deepening our considerable moat, financing our scale, scope and intellectual capital. This we believe will help ensure our ability to sustainably grow our platform over the longer term and perform well over our economic cycles. Earlier this week, we announced an attractive and strategic acquisition, which will deliver immediate value to our clients. We continue to build out Ryan Specialty benefits with the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire AccuRisk, which is targeted to close later this quarter and will add $25 million of annual revenue. AccuRisk is in part of medical stop loss MGU, and also provides capabilities in group captives, supplemental health care management and occupational accidents. We are excited to bring the highly regarded AccuRisk team on board. Our three recent acquisitions in the employee benefit space are now the cornerstone of our medical stop loss and employee benefits distribution and underwriting platform. As we are rapidly developing our product and services offering, to help our clients with integrated health solutions. We generally target firms that have a track record of both higher growth and greater long-term margin potential than the industry average. These employee benefits firms are perfectly aligned with those attributes. Further, we continue to believe there remains a long runway for both organic and inorganic growth and medical stop loss and more broadly, employee benefits. Building on a strong year in executing on M&A, our pipeline remains robust. It speaks well to our ability to source a myriad of potential transactions both tuck-ins and larger acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions, particularly in the current environment as we will only move forward but all of our criteria are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. We continue to make targeted investments in talent during the quarter, to further enhance our capabilities in both current and developing lines of business. These investments in talent offer the greatest returns for our shareholders and are part of a proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. Now turning to ACCELERATE 2025. As we continue to execute on our restructuring actions, we've identified additional opportunities to drive continued growth and innovation, deliver sustainable productivity over the longer term and accelerate margin improvement. We now expect to generate annual savings of approximately $50 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges of approximately $90 million through the end of 2024. Turning to the market. The E&S marketplace remained robust, providing solutions that are otherwise simply not available or hard to place risks. We expect this trend to support our growth and continue for the foreseeable future. As we have previously noted, we've invested significantly in those lines, and we see clear opportunities to grow. In addition to Goldstein the lines of the business or our clients need us the most. Looking forward, we recognize the more uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, and expect favorable specialty insurance market dynamics to persist, which we believe will provide us with robust opportunities for continued growth. We are well positioned to further capture the broader E&S tailwinds through our flexible and differentiated business model, and capitalize on our specific lines of accelerated growth. Our exceptional team continues to consistently deliver adding value for our clients, trading partners and ultimately our shareholders. Now I'm pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim?\nTimothy Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. The third quarter saw a momentum from the first half of the year seamlessly carry forward as we generated double-digit growth across all our specialties. Turning to the market. Ongoing industry trends persist, notably an increasingly complex weather and legal environment, a sizable pullback in risk appetite from the admitted market and uncertainty regarding reserve adequacy. These trends are driving more risks into the E&S marketplace, which offers significantly more freedom of rate and form and is thus able to provide critical solutions for these risks. Given our specialized and industry-leading team's ability to navigate the complexities of the market, we plan to continue delivering and exceeding expectations for our clients. Diving into our specialties. Our wholesale brokerage specialty generated another quarter of strong growth. In property, elevated loss activity driven by severe convective storms, higher reinsurance costs, persistent inflation and ongoing focus on insurance to value and a reduction in available capacity make for an incredibly challenging market. These factors are continuing to drive flow of new business into the E&S market. The E&S market continues to respond well, providing solutions for insureds while surplus lines insurers are exhibiting more conservative appetites and tighter limit management especially around coastal property, severe convective storms, wildfire, flood and earthquake risk. Our teams of experts are assisting our clients in navigating the significant complexities of this market and devising tailored solutions that best fit the insurers' needs. Our casualty practice also had another strong quarter driven by higher flow into the E&S market in both primary and excess casualty, particularly for large venue risks, health care, habitational and real estate which are all experiencing higher loss trends driven by economic and social inflation and reserving issues. Our transportation practice continue to see significant flow in the quarter driven by social inflation, carrier need for continued rate increases, a pullback in underwriter appetite and market exits. We also received strong contributions in the quarter from our new team members that joined us through our acquisition of Socius, which officially came on board at the beginning of July. Overall, our wholesale brokerage specialty remains dedicated to executing on its game plan, which includes continued evolution of strategies and products to meet changing needs, and we expect to generate consistent and profitable growth for the foreseeable future. Our binding authority specialty had an excellent quarter with the trends we saw in the first half of the year continuing in the third quarter despite ongoing capacity constraints in personal lines. There remains plenty of potential for panel consolidation as a steady, long-term growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to execute. Our Underwriting Management specialty also performed very well. Growth was driven by sustained broad-based rate increases, particularly in property, contributions from new growth initiatives such as excess casualty and alternative risk solutions, incremental capacity fueling growth in cat property, transportation and at our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re; and Profit commissions, including many of the strong historical performance in the preceding soft market cycle. We also announced the acquisition of AccuRisk, which adds breadth and depth to our growing benefits practice. As Pat mentioned in his remarks, our acquisition strategy continues to provide us with new avenues such as alternative risks and benefits to substantially expand our total addressable market. This will enable us to further grow alongside our clients' evolving needs, ensure our ability to sustainably grow our platform over the longer term and perform over economic cycles. Turning to price. Through Q3, we remained in a prolonged stage of historically hard market conditions. Pricing in the E&S market largely held firm or accelerated in many lines of business with property continuing to see the strongest rate momentum, though in a seasonally smaller quarter, exceptions remain in public company D&O and Cyber. As with all cycles, as certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy, admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. That said, we still have yet to see this play out, and the standard market has not meaningfully impacted rate or flow in the aggregate. We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our third quarter. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q3, we grew total revenue 21.8% period-over-period to $502 million, fueled by another strong quarter of organic revenue growth coming in at 14.7%. And M&A, which added over four percentage points to our topline. Growth was driven by ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market, strong renewal retention and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business. Net income for Q3 2023 was $16 million. One of the acquisitions we made in Q3, Socius, was a C Corp at the time of acquisition. Right after closing, we executed a legal entity reorganization by converting Socius to an LLC, which, of course, made it a pass-through entity for tax purposes and then subsequently transferred the entity to our operating LLC which is where we typically buy and hold our acquisitions. The result of these actions was a great outcome for shareholders, particularly with regards to tax efficiency. These actions did, however, create a onetime non-cash deferred tax expense at the public holding company, which created a loss of $0.04 per diluted share for the quarter. Since we have no plan to ever sell Socius, we do not expect this tax expense will ever be realized in cash. Going forward, we do not expect any change in the company's annual effective tax rate related to these actions, and we will likely pursue a similar strategy with respect to any future acquisitions of C Corps. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $87 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the third quarter grew 25.8% period-over-period to $147 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin improved 90 basis points to 29.3%, driven by strong organic revenue growth and higher fiduciary investment income and partially offset by continued investments in our business. Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program. We had approximately $16 million of charges in the quarter. We identified additional opportunities to wisely invest, to drive more efficiencies and thus, greater savings and we remain well on pace to complete the program by the end of 2024. As Pat mentioned, we now expect to generate annual savings of approximately $50 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges of approximately $90 million through the end of 2024. We expect just over half the charges in calendar year 2023 than the remainder to flow throughout 2024. As Pat also mentioned, we will continue making targeted investments in the fourth quarter in talent and recruitment. These investments in talent, particularly recruiting new colleagues, historically have offered the highest returns for our shareholders, and are part of our proven approach to maintaining our long-term growth prospects. Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds of approximately $31 million in Q4, which incorporates the impact of the AccuRisk acquisition. Turning to guidance, we are now guiding our organic revenue growth rate for the full-year 2023 to be between 13.5% and 14.5%, which reflects an increase of 50 basis points to the floor compared to our previous guide range of 13.0% to 14.5%. In addition, we are raising the low end of our full-year adjusted EBITDAC margin guidance range and are now guiding to full-year adjusted EBITDAC margin of between 29.5% and 30.0%. In summary, we're very pleased with our third quarter performance, and we remain very excited about our both near- and long-term prospects. With that, we thank you for your time, and we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. Good evening. My first question is on your organic growth guide. You guys raised the guidance for the full-year, but you're at 14.7% year-to-date, 13.5% to 14.5% now for the full-year. And that would imply, right, that the fourth quarter could come in a range of 12% to 14%. So I'm just hoping to get more color. Are you expecting a decel in the Q4? Because I thought that other than the second quarter, the fourth quarter has higher property concentration and that should be a tailwind or maybe there's just some conservatism built into the guide?\nJeremiah Bickham: Hi, there, Elyse. No, your recollection is correct. Q4 is seasonally our biggest quarter. It does have the second most amount of property business, second to Q2. But we did get some of the benefit of the acceleration in property last Q4. And so we've got some measured assumptions about that compounding on itself if there's a very, very strong showing in Q4, there is some potential upside related to property for sure.\nElyse Greenspan: And then on the savings program, the incremental savings that you guys are announcing tonight, are those expected so \u2013 the $50 million versus $35 million so that incremental $15 million. Is that expected to come in 2025? Or will we now see more savings now filter through in 2024 as well?\nJeremiah Bickham: The full $50 million won't show up until 2025 but relative to the prior estimate of $35 million of saves, there will be more flowing through next year, and that will be fully represented in our margin guide for 2024 that we released in Q1.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then Pat, you were talking about a robust M&A pipeline. I believe you said tuck-ins as well as larger acquisitions. What do you guys define I guess, as larger deals? And have you seen any change just in multiples on potential transactions, either tuck-ins or larger deals over the course of the past year?\nPatrick Ryan: I would say that tuck-ins are obvious. Larger deals would be of $400 million. You'll recall all risks was quite a bit higher than that. That would be our largest deal to date. We work on these transactions particularly the larger ones over an extended period of time. And so it's difficult to know if they do material \u2013 if they will materialize because of the length of time that it takes to bring these in. And so we just kind of time those in any accurate way. But in terms of valuations, Elyse, we, as you know, look to buy good to great companies. We're not a bottom fisher, we're not looking to buy projects. We, therefore, expect to pay a fair multiple. And so on good and great companies, multiples are still pretty consistent from what they've been. There could be some tailing off if there's a little lesser quality. But be assured that as we're looking very selectively on who we will bring into the Ryan Specialty family. They've got to be a really good company, and they have to have the potential that we can make them better and we can make great companies even better. So that's how we look at it.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, good afternoon. First question on M&A because you guys have stressed a lot especially in your prepared remarks about kind of expanding your TAM and addressable market alternative risk and benefits. Just curious, like is there a way you can express how much larger your TAM is to give us a better flavor of whether this net cash or keeping on the balance sheet really can be maybe fully deployed? Is that the goal that maybe all your free cash flow, some of your net cash over the next year could be deployed into both your \u2013 the markets you're in, plus this expanded TAM? Or is this just a small expanded TAM?\nPatrick Ryan: Well, we're always looking to expand TAM in as large a way as practical and possible. But to say directly, to answer directly your question about all of our dry powder, we'd be delighted to invest all of that and more. We keep working on these kinds of deals. We've had, I think, a quite good 2023 in terms of adding to our total addressable market. We believe that it's been an active year for us. It's been a very successful M&A year. There's time left in the year. And so we're looking forward to continue to deploy that dry powder, and we have a balance sheet that can accept within our guidelines of debt ratios, a considerable more debt. So yes, we're ambitious in what we're looking for.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Maybe switching gears to some of the excellent revenue growth and binding authorities and Underwriting Management really saw an acceleration of revenue growth there. Could you offer any more color or flavor of what's driving that M&A versus organic? And just whether you're operating kind of at a \u2013 if there's some tailwinds there we should be thinking about?\nTimothy Turner: Yes. We continue to grow and expand as we have, but it's accelerated, and it's driven mostly in our binding authorities and our MGU strategy in areas like cat property. As you know, the wind, the wildfire, the convective storm and the flood affecting so many different businesses across the country in different geographies. So we've capitalized on that. The flow of business into the channel coming into binding and into the MGA side of the business is really part of the strategy. If you note our \u2013 the way we've arranged our MGUs, our binding authorities behind our brokerage horsepower in the practice group verticals led by Cap property, but also long tail, high-hazard casualty business, that's working out very well for us. So that's part of it. I'll let Miles respond even more specifically on the MGU side.\nMiles Wuller: Certainly. I appreciate the question. So look, just to add, again, rate definitely opportunity is certainly up, launching incremental products. We've successfully launched our international renewable facility, excess casualty has expanded, trucking has expanded, incremental capital and extremely key products right now, property, treaty reinsurance. The inorganic element that we are quite proud of has grown, and that's our profit commissions. So again, this is reflective of our profit generated to the carriers. Some of these measurements are actually might be in from three or four years ago. So keeping in mind we're earning these from the soft market years, and the \u2013 we're starting to collect them today. So we're quite proud of that inorganic contribution to our growth.\nMichael Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Cox: Hey. Thanks. So I think expectations in the second quarter were for double-digit organic growth in both property and casualty lines of business in the second half of 2023. So I'm curious if that materialized in the quarter and how you see growth developing between these two classes of business as we head into 2024?\nTimothy Turner: Well, clearly, cat property has been the leading driver into the channel. But right behind it is long-tail casualty business, as I mentioned, and the real high hazard casualty business, led by transportation, consumer product liability, habitational real estate. Again, that's a property and a casualty loss leader in the reinsurance world. That's expanding. Those classes of business and some others, led by public entity, some of the sports and entertainment classes, higher education, large venue risks, really continuing to grow and expand in the non-admitted property and casualty channel. Miles?\nMiles Wuller: Yes, absolutely. Thank you. So \u2013 look, so rates and terms remain very firm for property, but compounding that is our app bats are increasingly. So even non-wind habitational \u2013 we've had the benefit of our results and risk management tools that have allowed us to continue to track capacity when others are pulling back, and now we're meeting needs that others are forced to pull back from. So we've seen that in the last quarter and continuing into next year. So we think we're well positioned.\nRobert Cox: Got it. Appreciate that. And on the property comments, I mean, I think the comments here and in the press release were that property pricing and submission flow were the drivers of growth despite a lower weighting to cat in the quarter. I think some investors hope to view that this growth is somewhat temporary in nature and might eventually create a difficult headwind for growth. So I'm curious if you could comment on that notion at all and perhaps the sustainability of the property flow into the E&S market in 2024?\nTimothy Turner: We tend to disagree with that. And really, we follow the global warming and the impacts of all of that. And it's really more difficult than ever for carriers to be profitable in cat. But it's much more than just coastal wind. It's affecting every geography in the United States today, and it's wildfire's convective storm. It's flood. It's driving much more business than just the win in the wind buying season. So we see it having a positive impact on all four quarters, and the demand for our products, solutions and services to continue to increase. We see no let up in that.\nMiles Wuller: And just the only class I'd add is even course of construction has remained extremely robust in both submission count and revenue contribution, and we are obviously conscious of rising rate environment and the impact of both buyers and builders. But the reality is there's a major structural shortfall in available housing units in the U.S. that we continue to meet through E&S products.\nRobert Cox: Okay. Awesome. Thanks for that. And maybe just lastly from me. I think there's been some speculation out there that some larger brokers can enter the wholesale space, but it feels like it may not make the most sense for them to compete where you do. So curious if you have any views on the impact of Ryan, should a larger broker enter the whole sales space in some form?\nPatrick Ryan: Sure. Well, I'll start out by saying that the first time you met us, we talked about the value of being independent. Independent being defined as not competing with our clients. We have grown, we've prospered for multiple reasons, one of which is that we're independent. We don't compete with our clients. I think that larger brokers have studied this. I know for a fact, they have, you probably do as well. They haven't made the decision to go in. But I think a lot of it is around the issue we're the right owner for a wholesaler. And we believe passionately and independence is a real differentiator. So we don't sit around wondering and worrying that they're going to come in. If they come in, they have to compete with some very tough competition. And remember this, all the brokers that we do business is we believe that they passionately want to do what's best for their clients. And what's best for the client in our minds, is a great talent pool that we have that are differentiating. So we have several clients in their own wholesaler, but they bring us the tough hazard and hazard risk. They bring us to risks that we are uniquely qualified to handle because of our industry, our product expertise. So if you want to really survey this, just talk to retailers about who are the go-to places to go on really hard risk, and you're going to hear Ryan Specialty, RT mentioned very often. So we're very proud and pleased at the position we're in. And if more competition comes in, we still think that they need us, and they use us when they need us. And we understand that. So we keep building their need for us. That's a big part of our strategy.\nRobert Cox: Thanks. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. [Indiscernible] Pat, I'm just curious, there's a potential very large wholesaler that's going to get sold to a private equity shop. Does that create any opportunities for you? Do you ever see like teams fall out after something like that happens? With the relationship there with the big bank potentially call some business to shake out?\nPatrick Ryan: Well, I've got to be very careful answering this question. Yes. First of all, we don't have movement out of our company. As you know, we retain our talent. Some people do have movement out of the company, their company. And that's kind of a cultural thing. That's a strategic issue. I'd rather not comment on what might happen to any individual company. That's not something we do talk about competitors or clients for that matter. So if you'll pardon my not commenting on that, I'll just say that in the brokerage business, and you've observed this across brokerage space, there's a lot of mobility. There's a lot of mobility. And fortunately, we have a culture that has allowed us to maintain our talent. Fortunately, we have a platform that allows the people who join us to get significant productivity increases. So people who come from another firm almost always, fast, fast majority of the time, increase their productivity. When we make acquisitions, like Socius, they're already increasing their productivity, and they've only been with us a few months. So it's the culture, it's the trading relationships that we have with capital providers, it's the trading relationships of trust and reliability that we have with our retail brokers. They know that we are passionate about serving them well and helping them serve their clients well, partnering on their behalf. So talent wins in this business. Talent wins in this business. And that's why we're winning.\nBrian Meredith: Makes sense. Appreciate that. And then a second question, just curious, transactional type business. Are you seeing any pickup there? Any green shoots kind of what's the view there?\nTimothy Turner: Well, global M&A transactions volumes remain under pressure. I mean, certainly in light of higher interest rates and macro uncertainty. We are seeing incremental opportunities. We've been doing our best to offset as much of that pressure through geographic expansion and product expansion, including the launch of our first office in Singapore. Behind us, though, there's two substantial losses in the industry totaling speculated to total almost $1.4 billion. So therefore, despite lower deal volumes, we remain very optimistic on rate going into next year.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks so much and good evening all. I think there's a question for Jeremiah. When you provide guidance going forward, what is the assumption for supplemental and contingent commissions embedded in that? Not numerically but conceptually?\nJeremiah Bickham: A good question, Meyer. Supplemental and contingent commissions are not part of the organic growth calculation. So they're not contemplated in organic revenue guidance. But our forecast, of course, does contemplate them on the margin guidance.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That's helpful. A second broader question. I know we've touched on this, but I'm trying to get a sense as to the \u2013 maybe acceleration of rate increases or the acceleration of business moving to the E&S market on the casualty side as social inflation persists or accelerate. In between, is it easy to see any inflection point on either of those?\nTimothy Turner: We see a steady increase in flow in the high-hazard aspects of casualty Meyer. I gave a few examples earlier, but transportation, maybe the number one \u2013 the loss leader in the reinsurance world is being dumped and shed by almost every standard company, that's pouring into the channel. And that's every aspect of transportation from long-haul trucking, delivery, to shared economy and small commercial fleets we're seeing. And we were prepared for it. We've made the Crouse acquisition for that reason. We've built up our binding authorities and our MGUs in transportation. And then habitational. Maybe the second largest leading loss leader in the reinsurance world, doing a lot of damage in the standard market, we see that increasing in flow. And the rates continue to rise even in the non-admitted marketplace. Any type of venue business where large crowds gather, unfortunately, whether it's universities, stadiums, large sports venues, we see that pouring in. And then one of our traditional long tail, high hazard classes of business, consumer product liability, we see a tremendous amount of that pouring into the channel. Lots of demand for our solutions there. So it's really the loss leaders and the high-hazard niches within the casualty segment.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys. I think the \u2013 so on the margins, I think year-to-date margins are like a little over 30%. And the guide is for 29.5% to 30%. I know it's not that big of a difference, but just wondering what you're expecting to drive lower margin in 4Q. Is it simply hiring?\nJeremiah Bickham: It's hiring continued investments in the business that we're doing perpetually, and there is still a little bit of a lingering effect of the hiring we made in 2022 that will have an impact in Q4. It's getting less as time goes on, but there's still an impact in Q4 from that.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thank you. And then the three \u2013 the benefits businesses that you've acquired, just wondering sort of how they fit together or complement each other. I think they're relatively smaller. So curious how the integration effort differs from your wholesale P&C deals.\nPatrick Ryan: Great question. You're right. They do differ, but they were very deliberately targeted, the first two ACE and Point6 are basically distributors and quite effective distributors. AccuRisk, is, in fact, a managing general underwriter that specializes in medical stop loss, but has a really excellent integrated health plan which is a major part of our strategy. We have a terrific management team, a very experienced outstanding management team. So that helps tie those three together. But AccuRisk also has skills that we believe are going to be important to the distribution and building of the entire plan, which is that they've got an ability to manage group captives in addition to the integrated health plan. And we believe the funding of self-insured plans often are going to migrate in the group captives. Also, we believe that there's a really strong need by retailers generally, maybe not the top two or three or four or five, but they need help. And that's why we've gone into it to provide these services to our clients. So it really runs through the top 100, I have to say, the top pick at five, need help in executing on these opportunities. And so we feel that this foundation of these three now really gives us a product to take the market that will solve for the needs of these retail brokers. So this is a step-by-step process. More to come, but we really believe that together now, we have close to $400 million of medical stop loss premium. And as we've said in the past, Self-insurance is migrating quickly in different segments of the commercial market. Many smaller firms in 100 to 200 and even sometimes smaller than that, migrating into self-insurance. And so the ability to help them provide medical stop loss and then to get them an integrated health plan to supplement that has been our goal. And then ultimately, as we said in the past, we believe that the funding often as we go in the future here is going to be through group captive funding mechanisms. And so AccuRisk brings us that as well.\nMichael Ward: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Thank you. I'm wondering how has business mix by product lines changed in the third quarter of 2023 versus the third quarter 2022? That might have played into your strong organic revenue growth of 14.7% this quarter.\nPatrick Ryan: I don't think that's a factor as much as the momentum. The momentum is strong.\nJeremiah Bickham: Well, yes, and Tracy, if you'll recall, in Q3 of last year is when we started a rapid deceleration in public D&O. Public D&O is still a headwind for us, but its impact is less compared to a year ago.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. So the public D&O hasn't fully cycled out yet?\nJeremiah Bickham: Well, we've been through 12 months of pain on it, but rates keep going down. It's just the impact in Q3 of 2023 was lesser of an impact than Q3 of 2022. And this is one example.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Got it. I also want to touch upon your Underwriting Management. You mentioned the profit commissions. I'm just wondering, could that work the other way, like, let's say, do you have to pay a clawback if the casualty loss ratios are worse than whatever target you mutually set up with the carrier?\nTimothy Turner: No, I appreciate the question, but I want to emphasize, we only recognize the profit commissions when they are both collected and fully earned. We never accrue anything that could be \u2013 there is no clawback in any of these.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay. So then there'll just be no profit commission if you didn't hit the loss ratios over time?\nTimothy Turner: Exactly. A miss would result in a zero. We only recognize it when it's earned and never opened a clawback.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And it looks like we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And therefore, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Ryan for any closing comments.\nPatrick Ryan: Well, it was a very fast discussion. We're very pleased with how well our team has performed through the first nine months. We're very proud of the performance. We're very thankful for your support and interest in your good questions. We'll be talking to you in another three months. But several of you prior to that, obviously. Have a good evening.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Certainly. I appreciate the question. So look, just to add, again, rate definitely opportunity is certainly up, launching incremental products. We've successfully launched our international renewable facility, excess casualty has expanded, trucking has expanded, incremental capital and extremely key products right now, property, treaty reinsurance. The inorganic element that we are quite proud of has grown, and that's our profit commissions. So again, this is reflective of our profit generated to the carriers. Some of these measurements are actually might be in from three or four years ago. So keeping in mind we're earning these from the soft market years, and the \u2013 we're starting to collect them today. So we're quite proud of that inorganic contribution to our growth. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. So \u2013 look, so rates and terms remain very firm for property, but compounding that is our app bats are increasingly. So even non-wind habitational \u2013 we've had the benefit of our results and risk management tools that have allowed us to continue to track capacity when others are pulling back, and now we're meeting needs that others are forced to pull back from. So we've seen that in the last quarter and continuing into next year. So we think we're well positioned. And just the only class I'd add is even course of construction has remained extremely robust in both submission count and revenue contribution, and we are obviously conscious of rising rate environment and the impact of both buyers and builders. But the reality is there's a major structural shortfall in available housing units in the U.S. that we continue to meet through E&S products."

            "name": "Patrick Ryan",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. With me on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham, our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller. Also with us is our Head of Investor Relations, Nick Mezick. Ryan Specialty had another strong quarter as we continued to successfully execute on our strategic, financial and operational objectives. We grew total revenue of 21.8% and by organic growth of 14.7%. We saw broad-based strength across our specialties and in various lines of business, as well as strong contributions from our recent acquisitions was notably Socius. This quarter is a great example of how strategic M&A contributes to total revenue growth and will contribute to organic growth in future years. We also generated double-digit growth in both adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. I'm very pleased with our results as the entire Ryan Specialty team continues to perform at a high level and further validate our differentiated business model. Along with our excellent results, I'm excited to note that we continue to execute on our M&A strategy. Before diving into the details, I want to reiterate how we think about M&A. Our M&A strategy is aligned around the evolving and growing needs of our clients in order to create a dynamic value proposition. Our focus is on M&A opportunities with the highest quality specialty distributors, including wholesale, delegated authority and employee benefits. We are building out our alternative risk strategy by structuring solutions beyond traditional insurance placements to support our clients and the needs of the insurer fee for P&C or employee benefit strategies. Through this M&A strategy that we are steadily expanding our total addressable market within specialty insurance and deepening our considerable moat, financing our scale, scope and intellectual capital. This we believe will help ensure our ability to sustainably grow our platform over the longer term and perform well over our economic cycles. Earlier this week, we announced an attractive and strategic acquisition, which will deliver immediate value to our clients. We continue to build out Ryan Specialty benefits with the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire AccuRisk, which is targeted to close later this quarter and will add $25 million of annual revenue. AccuRisk is in part of medical stop loss MGU, and also provides capabilities in group captives, supplemental health care management and occupational accidents. We are excited to bring the highly regarded AccuRisk team on board. Our three recent acquisitions in the employee benefit space are now the cornerstone of our medical stop loss and employee benefits distribution and underwriting platform. As we are rapidly developing our product and services offering, to help our clients with integrated health solutions. We generally target firms that have a track record of both higher growth and greater long-term margin potential than the industry average. These employee benefits firms are perfectly aligned with those attributes. Further, we continue to believe there remains a long runway for both organic and inorganic growth and medical stop loss and more broadly, employee benefits. Building on a strong year in executing on M&A, our pipeline remains robust. It speaks well to our ability to source a myriad of potential transactions both tuck-ins and larger acquisitions. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions, particularly in the current environment as we will only move forward but all of our criteria are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. We continue to make targeted investments in talent during the quarter, to further enhance our capabilities in both current and developing lines of business. These investments in talent offer the greatest returns for our shareholders and are part of a proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. Now turning to ACCELERATE 2025. As we continue to execute on our restructuring actions, we've identified additional opportunities to drive continued growth and innovation, deliver sustainable productivity over the longer term and accelerate margin improvement. We now expect to generate annual savings of approximately $50 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges of approximately $90 million through the end of 2024. Turning to the market. The E&S marketplace remained robust, providing solutions that are otherwise simply not available or hard to place risks. We expect this trend to support our growth and continue for the foreseeable future. As we have previously noted, we've invested significantly in those lines, and we see clear opportunities to grow. In addition to Goldstein the lines of the business or our clients need us the most. Looking forward, we recognize the more uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, and expect favorable specialty insurance market dynamics to persist, which we believe will provide us with robust opportunities for continued growth. We are well positioned to further capture the broader E&S tailwinds through our flexible and differentiated business model, and capitalize on our specific lines of accelerated growth. Our exceptional team continues to consistently deliver adding value for our clients, trading partners and ultimately our shareholders. Now I'm pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim? I would say that tuck-ins are obvious. Larger deals would be of $400 million. You'll recall all risks was quite a bit higher than that. That would be our largest deal to date. We work on these transactions particularly the larger ones over an extended period of time. And so it's difficult to know if they do material \u2013 if they will materialize because of the length of time that it takes to bring these in. And so we just kind of time those in any accurate way. But in terms of valuations, Elyse, we, as you know, look to buy good to great companies. We're not a bottom fisher, we're not looking to buy projects. We, therefore, expect to pay a fair multiple. And so on good and great companies, multiples are still pretty consistent from what they've been. There could be some tailing off if there's a little lesser quality. But be assured that as we're looking very selectively on who we will bring into the Ryan Specialty family. They've got to be a really good company, and they have to have the potential that we can make them better and we can make great companies even better. So that's how we look at it. Well, we're always looking to expand TAM in as large a way as practical and possible. But to say directly, to answer directly your question about all of our dry powder, we'd be delighted to invest all of that and more. We keep working on these kinds of deals. We've had, I think, a quite good 2023 in terms of adding to our total addressable market. We believe that it's been an active year for us. It's been a very successful M&A year. There's time left in the year. And so we're looking forward to continue to deploy that dry powder, and we have a balance sheet that can accept within our guidelines of debt ratios, a considerable more debt. So yes, we're ambitious in what we're looking for. Sure. Well, I'll start out by saying that the first time you met us, we talked about the value of being independent. Independent being defined as not competing with our clients. We have grown, we've prospered for multiple reasons, one of which is that we're independent. We don't compete with our clients. I think that larger brokers have studied this. I know for a fact, they have, you probably do as well. They haven't made the decision to go in. But I think a lot of it is around the issue we're the right owner for a wholesaler. And we believe passionately and independence is a real differentiator. So we don't sit around wondering and worrying that they're going to come in. If they come in, they have to compete with some very tough competition. And remember this, all the brokers that we do business is we believe that they passionately want to do what's best for their clients. And what's best for the client in our minds, is a great talent pool that we have that are differentiating. So we have several clients in their own wholesaler, but they bring us the tough hazard and hazard risk. They bring us to risks that we are uniquely qualified to handle because of our industry, our product expertise. So if you want to really survey this, just talk to retailers about who are the go-to places to go on really hard risk, and you're going to hear Ryan Specialty, RT mentioned very often. So we're very proud and pleased at the position we're in. And if more competition comes in, we still think that they need us, and they use us when they need us. And we understand that. So we keep building their need for us. That's a big part of our strategy. Well, I've got to be very careful answering this question. Yes. First of all, we don't have movement out of our company. As you know, we retain our talent. Some people do have movement out of the company, their company. And that's kind of a cultural thing. That's a strategic issue. I'd rather not comment on what might happen to any individual company. That's not something we do talk about competitors or clients for that matter. So if you'll pardon my not commenting on that, I'll just say that in the brokerage business, and you've observed this across brokerage space, there's a lot of mobility. There's a lot of mobility. And fortunately, we have a culture that has allowed us to maintain our talent. Fortunately, we have a platform that allows the people who join us to get significant productivity increases. So people who come from another firm almost always, fast, fast majority of the time, increase their productivity. When we make acquisitions, like Socius, they're already increasing their productivity, and they've only been with us a few months. So it's the culture, it's the trading relationships that we have with capital providers, it's the trading relationships of trust and reliability that we have with our retail brokers. They know that we are passionate about serving them well and helping them serve their clients well, partnering on their behalf. So talent wins in this business. Talent wins in this business. And that's why we're winning. Great question. You're right. They do differ, but they were very deliberately targeted, the first two ACE and Point6 are basically distributors and quite effective distributors. AccuRisk, is, in fact, a managing general underwriter that specializes in medical stop loss, but has a really excellent integrated health plan which is a major part of our strategy.

And so AccuRisk brings us that as well. I don't think that's a factor as much as the momentum. The momentum is strong. Well, it was a very fast discussion.

We'll be talking to you in another three months. But several of you prior to that, obviously. Have a good evening."

            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. The third quarter saw a momentum from the first half of the year seamlessly carry forward as we generated double-digit growth across all our specialties. Turning to the market. Ongoing industry trends persist, notably an increasingly complex weather and legal environment, a sizable pullback in risk appetite from the admitted market and uncertainty regarding reserve adequacy. These trends are driving more risks into the E&S marketplace, which offers significantly more freedom of rate and form and is thus able to provide critical solutions for these risks. Given our specialized and industry-leading team's ability to navigate the complexities of the market, we plan to continue delivering and exceeding expectations for our clients. Diving into our specialties. Our wholesale brokerage specialty generated another quarter of strong growth. In property, elevated loss activity driven by severe convective storms, higher reinsurance costs, persistent inflation and ongoing focus on insurance to value and a reduction in available capacity make for an incredibly challenging market. These factors are continuing to drive flow of new business into the E&S market. The E&S market continues to respond well, providing solutions for insureds while surplus lines insurers are exhibiting more conservative appetites and tighter limit management especially around coastal property, severe convective storms, wildfire, flood and earthquake risk. Our teams of experts are assisting our clients in navigating the significant complexities of this market and devising tailored solutions that best fit the insurers' needs. Our casualty practice also had another strong quarter driven by higher flow into the E&S market in both primary and excess casualty, particularly for large venue risks, health care, habitational and real estate which are all experiencing higher loss trends driven by economic and social inflation and reserving issues. Our transportation practice continue to see significant flow in the quarter driven by social inflation, carrier need for continued rate increases, a pullback in underwriter appetite and market exits. We also received strong contributions in the quarter from our new team members that joined us through our acquisition of Socius, which officially came on board at the beginning of July. Overall, our wholesale brokerage specialty remains dedicated to executing on its game plan, which includes continued evolution of strategies and products to meet changing needs, and we expect to generate consistent and profitable growth for the foreseeable future. Our binding authority specialty had an excellent quarter with the trends we saw in the first half of the year continuing in the third quarter despite ongoing capacity constraints in personal lines. There remains plenty of potential for panel consolidation as a steady, long-term growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to execute. Our Underwriting Management specialty also performed very well. Growth was driven by sustained broad-based rate increases, particularly in property, contributions from new growth initiatives such as excess casualty and alternative risk solutions, incremental capacity fueling growth in cat property, transportation and at our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re; and Profit commissions, including many of the strong historical performance in the preceding soft market cycle. We also announced the acquisition of AccuRisk, which adds breadth and depth to our growing benefits practice. As Pat mentioned in his remarks, our acquisition strategy continues to provide us with new avenues such as alternative risks and benefits to substantially expand our total addressable market. This will enable us to further grow alongside our clients' evolving needs, ensure our ability to sustainably grow our platform over the longer term and perform over economic cycles. Turning to price. Through Q3, we remained in a prolonged stage of historically hard market conditions. Pricing in the E&S market largely held firm or accelerated in many lines of business with property continuing to see the strongest rate momentum, though in a seasonally smaller quarter, exceptions remain in public company D&O and Cyber. As with all cycles, as certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy, admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. That said, we still have yet to see this play out, and the standard market has not meaningfully impacted rate or flow in the aggregate. We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our third quarter. Thank you. Yes. We continue to grow and expand as we have, but it's accelerated, and it's driven mostly in our binding authorities and our MGU strategy in areas like cat property. As you know, the wind, the wildfire, the convective storm and the flood affecting so many different businesses across the country in different geographies. So we've capitalized on that. The flow of business into the channel coming into binding and into the MGA side of the business is really part of the strategy. If you note our \u2013 the way we've arranged our MGUs, our binding authorities behind our brokerage horsepower in the practice group verticals led by Cap property, but also long tail, high-hazard casualty business, that's working out very well for us. So that's part of it. I'll let Miles respond even more specifically on the MGU side. Well, clearly, cat property has been the leading driver into the channel. But right behind it is long-tail casualty business, as I mentioned, and the real high hazard casualty business, led by transportation, consumer product liability, habitational real estate. Again, that's a property and a casualty loss leader in the reinsurance world. That's expanding. Those classes of business and some others, led by public entity, some of the sports and entertainment classes, higher education, large venue risks, really continuing to grow and expand in the non-admitted property and casualty channel. Miles? We tend to disagree with that. And really, we follow the global warming and the impacts of all of that. And it's really more difficult than ever for carriers to be profitable in cat. But it's much more than just coastal wind. It's affecting every geography in the United States today, and it's wildfire's convective storm. It's flood. It's driving much more business than just the win in the wind buying season. So we see it having a positive impact on all four quarters, and the demand for our products, solutions and services to continue to increase. We see no let up in that. Well, global M&A transactions volumes remain under pressure. I mean, certainly in light of higher interest rates and macro uncertainty. We are seeing incremental opportunities. We've been doing our best to offset as much of that pressure through geographic expansion and product expansion, including the launch of our first office in Singapore. Behind us, though, there's two substantial losses in the industry totaling speculated to total almost $1.4 billion. So therefore, despite lower deal volumes, we remain very optimistic on rate going into next year. We see a steady increase in flow in the high-hazard aspects of casualty Meyer. I gave a few examples earlier, but transportation, maybe the number one \u2013 the loss leader in the reinsurance world is being dumped and shed by almost every standard company, that's pouring into the channel. And that's every aspect of transportation from long-haul trucking, delivery, to shared economy and small commercial fleets we're seeing. And we were prepared for it. We've made the Crouse acquisition for that reason. We've built up our binding authorities and our MGUs in transportation. And then habitational. Maybe the second largest leading loss leader in the reinsurance world, doing a lot of damage in the standard market, we see that increasing in flow. And the rates continue to rise even in the non-admitted marketplace. Any type of venue business where large crowds gather, unfortunately, whether it's universities, stadiums, large sports venues, we see that pouring in. And then one of our traditional long tail, high hazard classes of business, consumer product liability, we see a tremendous amount of that pouring into the channel. Lots of demand for our solutions there. So it's really the loss leaders and the high-hazard niches within the casualty segment. No, I appreciate the question, but I want to emphasize, we only recognize the profit commissions when they are both collected and fully earned. We never accrue anything that could be \u2013 there is no clawback in any of these. Exactly. A miss would result in a zero. We only recognize it when it's earned and never opened a clawback."

Ryan Specialty had a great quarter with strong momentum continuing across all of our strategic financial and operational objectives. We grew total revenue of 19.1% led by organic growth of 16.1%, building on the 22.3% organic growth in the second quarter of 2022. We also achieved double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. We saw broad-based strength across our specialties, particularly in property and in many individual lines of business. The specific headwinds we noted on our prior calls were in line with our expectations and partially offset some of the very strong tailwinds we experienced in property. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance in the quarter and throughout the first half of 2023. In addition to delivering great results, we continue to execute on our M&A strategy. In July, we completed 3 attractive and strategic acquisitions, which added scale and scope to our Wholesale specialty and lost our benefits practice. The first is Socius Insurance Services. Approximately $40 million of annual revenue Socius adds high-quality talent to our professional lines and cyber teams and deepens our scale and scope in key hubs like San Francisco, Tampa and Miami. We are confident in the outlook for this business, given our long-standing familiarity with the team and our proven ability to help firms grow on our platform through our relationships with the top 100 retail brokers access to our proprietary products and expand carrier relationships. We also completed 2 employee benefits acquisitions. Point6 Healthcare and ACE benefit partners, adding just under $10 million of annual revenue. These firms provide exceptional talent and foundational capabilities for Ryan Specialty Benefits. We have diligently assessed opportunities in the benefits market, targeting firms that have a track record of both growth and long-term margin greater than the industry average. And these medical stop-loss focus firms are perfectly aligned with those attributes. Medical stop-loss insurance plays the vital role by smoothing the volatility in health care spend through reinsuring a self-funded benefits plan against high-cost claims. We expect medical stop-loss insurance to continue to play a crucial role in financing and risk mitigation strategies, particularly as health care innovation accelerate in high-cost drugs and gene therapies become more prevalent. We are pleased to enter this niche that boasts over $25 billion in premium in the U.S. with a 12% compound annual growth rate since 2014. We believe there is a long runway for both organic and inorganic growth in benefits and are excited to have these capabilities to our specialties.  Further on the M&A front, our pipeline remains robust. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions, particularly in the current environment, as we will only move forward when all of our criteria are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. We continue to make targeted investments during the quarter as we brought on additional talent to further enhance our current capabilities and develop areas where we anticipate our clients need us in the future. These investments, particularly in the recruitment of new colleagues offer the greatest returns for our shareholders and are part of a proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. That takes us to ACCELERATE 2025, our 2-year restructuring program announced earlier this year. We are making investments that will enable continued growth, drive innovation, deliver sustainable productivity increases over the long term and accelerate margin improvement. We have made solid progress in the second quarter, which Jeremiah will discuss further. We remain on track to generate a targeted annual savings of at least $35 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges expected to be at least $65 million through the end of 2024. Throughout the second quarter, the E&S marketplace remained robust. E&S continues to provide solutions that are otherwise not available for hard-to-place risks. As we previously noted, we've invested significantly in those lines where we see clear opportunities to grow in addition to bolstering the lines of business our clients need us the most. We've also continued to expand our ability to serve brokers, agents and carriers through innovation and creating alternatives to traditional insurance placements in areas like cat property and transportation. Looking ahead, we expect favorable specialty insurance market dynamics to persist, and we remain confident that 2023 will continue to be another strong year for our firm. We are in a prime position to capture broader E&S tailwinds and also further capitalize on our specific lines of accelerated growth. Our differentiated business model allows us to remain ahead of the competition, and our flexibility enables us to quickly adapt and pivot when market conditions shift. We continue to expand our total addressable market through innovation and strategic acquisitions and further deepen our moat with scale, scope of intellectual capital. We're able to do all of this because of our exceptional team, who consistently deliver impressive results and value for our clients trading partners and ultimately, to our shareholders.  Now I'm pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim?\nTimothy Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. As Pat noted, it was another strong quarter across our specialties as we continue to successfully execute on winning new business and producing innovative solutions for our clients. The effects of industry trends such as climate change and natural disasters, accelerating social inflation and broad-based economic inflation happening concurrently with reduced insurance capital, a pullback in underwriter appetite and market exits make for an incredibly challenging insurance market.  Additionally, continuous change in the loss environment and growing uncertainty in reserve adequacy is driving more risks into the E&S marketplace, which offers significantly more freedom of rate and form. Given our specialized and industry-leading team's ability to navigate the complexities of the market, we plan to continue delivering for our clients and expect to further expand our market share.  Diving into our specialties. Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty generated another quarter of strong growth. In property, elevated levels of attritional and secondary perils, including severe convective storms and persistent inflation from higher cost of materials and labor shortages are driving up loss costs. Additionally, market conditions, including higher reinsurance costs, reduction in available capacity and ongoing requirements for proper valuations are driving higher retentions of risk and ultimately more volatility into the U.S. direct property market. These factors are continuing to drive flow of new business into the E&S market.  The E&S market is responding, yet it is also experiencing more conservative appetites, significant rate increases and tighter limit management, especially on coastal property, severe convective storms, wildfire, flood and earthquake risk. We are well positioned to assist our clients in navigating the complexities of this market. Our A+ team of experts are working tirelessly to bring important and creative solutions to our retail brokers and trading partners in this challenging market.  Our transportation practice continued to see substantial flow in the quarter fueled by social inflation, carrier need for continued rate increases and a pullback in underwriter appetite and market exits. We continue to win more than our fair share of new business and remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities.  Our casualty practice also performed very well in the quarter. We continue to see higher loss trends, inflation and reserving issues, drive more flow into the E&S channel across both primary and excess casualty, particularly in lines like health care, habitational and real estate. And as Pat noted, we completed the acquisition of Socius at the beginning of July, and are excited about the addition of new teammates who have hit the ground running and are a clear cultural match with Ryan Specialty. Overall, our Wholesale Brokerage specialty continues to successfully execute its game plan, and we see a long runway of consistent growth ahead.  In our Binding Authority specialty, we saw another quarter of solid growth in traditional binding, which includes small commercial business and growth in personal lines despite continued capacity constraints. We continue to see further potential for panel consolidation as a long and steady growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to execute.  Our Underwriting Management specialty also generated strong results led by continued steady and profitable growth in property and casualty and our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re. We also launched our benefits practice with the acquisitions of Point6 Healthcare and ACE Benefit Partners. Our team was extremely thoughtful in determining where we could best add value in this large and important market and medical stop loss is where we see a clear opportunity for rapid expansion within this fast-growing specialty niche. John Zern and his team are hard at work expanding our sales force in this practice. We look forward to updating you on the progress of benefits in the quarters ahead.  As we had mentioned on our prior call and as Pat just noted, the specific headwinds in certain lines in the second quarter, namely public company D&O, lower external M&A volumes and transactional liability and delayed starts in construction remained in line with our expectations. We expect any growth benefit in these 3 lines to be modest in the second half of the year.  Turning to price. Through Q2, we remained in the prolonged stages of a historically hard market. Pricing in the E&S market largely held firm or accelerated in many lines of business with property continuing to see the strongest rate momentum. Exceptions remain public company D&O and cyber where we saw further pressure as with all cycles. As pricing continues to increase and certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy, we see admitted markets step back in on certain placements particularly within large towers. But overall, we still have yet to see the standard market meaningfully impact rate or flow in the aggregate.  We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialties growth more so than rate.  With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our second quarter. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q2, we grew total revenue 19.1% period-over-period to $585 million fueled by another strong quarter of organic revenue growth at 16.1% as we continue to benefit from the ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market, particularly property, broad-based strength in many of our individual lines and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business.  Net income for Q2 '23 was $84 million or $0.26 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $124 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the second quarter grew 16.9% period-over-period to $194 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 60 basis points to 33.2%. Our EBITDAC margin was impacted by continued investments in our business, including last year's hiring and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels, both of which were partially offset by higher fiduciary investment income.  Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program. We had approximately $17 million of charges in the quarter as the program was able to move into full swing, slightly ahead of schedule. We remain well on track to generate annual savings of at least $35 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges projected to be at least $65 million through the end of 2024.  As Pat noted, we also continued to make targeted investments in the quarter, adding underwriting and broking talent to our ranks and expect consistent recruitment efforts to continue in the back half of the year. The cost of these investments, along with the annualization of our 2022 headcount growth, will continue to impact margin but will be partially offset by increases in fiduciary investment income. These investments in talent, particularly recruiting new colleagues, offer the highest returns for our shareholders and are part of a proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds of approximately $31 million in Q3 and $29 million in Q4. As a quick reminder, we paid for our 3 most recently announced acquisitions at the beginning of Q3, which reduced our operating funds relative to the 6/30 balance sheet. We are now guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2023 to be between 13.0% and 14.5%, up from our previous guide range of 10.5% to 13.0%. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin guidance range of 29.0% to 30.0%.  In summary, it was an excellent second quarter and first half performance by Ryan Specialty. We remain very excited for both our near- and long-term prospects.  With that, we thank you for your time, and we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question we have is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the updated organic growth, right, 13% to 14.5%. You guys were 14.6% for the first half of the year. And it sounds like there will still be some impact of the headwinds in the second half, but we are annualizing them. So why wouldn't organic growth be stronger in the back half, or is there just some level of conservatism built into the guidance update?\nJeremiah Bickham: Hi, Elyse, thanks for the question. So first off, I just want to acknowledge, we had a very good quarter that we're quite proud of and really the end to a very solid first half of the year. As you noted in our prepared remarks, we got a big boost from property this quarter. And because seasonally, Q2 has the highest amount of property and property cat business in our portfolio, that's why. And thus, we are expecting less of a lift from property in the second half of the year. But otherwise, we're implying that H2 will play out very similarly to H1, which means strong growth across the board, including double-digit growth contribution from our very balanced casualty portfolio as well. So overall, we feel great about where we're headed in H2, and we're very confident we can land within our increased organic growth guide range, which we feel would represent another very solid year for Ryan Specialty.\nElyse Greenspan: And then so Q2 -- Jeremiah, staying there for a second, Q2 I know you guys have said is the highest property concentration quarter. Of the other 3 quarters, are they all pretty close from a property perspective or would one stand out as having a higher concentration next to the second quarter?\nJeremiah Bickham: So Q2 is far and away the largest. And if you're just looking at percentage attribution of business, it doesn't even tell the whole story because not only does it have the highest overall property contribution but it's the highest cat property quarter of the year by far. The next highest is Q4, but we did experience a benefit in the last couple of weeks of Q4 from property rates surging. So we're not counting on the exact same growth in Q4 proportionately as we would a quarter like Q2 if that makes sense.\nElyse Greenspan: That does make sense. And then in terms of the M&A pipeline, you guys highlighted some of the activity during the quarter. How does the rest of the pipeline look, just in terms of other potential deals out there?\nPatrick Ryan: Thank you, Elyse. The -- it looks good. As I said, it's a robust pipeline. We are in discussions on additional benefits opportunities that will help round out our offering to our clients, add some significant new management talent and production talent. There's no way of knowing when, but it could be quite soon. We're in serious discussions.\nOperator: The next question is from Weston Bloomer of UBS.\nWeston Bloomer: My first question is on the margin guidance. You raised the full year organic that left the margin unchanged. Can you just talk to the types of investments you're making in the back half of the year and maybe what impact you're expecting within your margin guidance around normalization of T&E or wage inflation or other investments?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. Thank you, Weston. So as we said for multiple quarters now, the biggest impact to our margin at the moment is our outsized hiring activity from last year, which we know is the right investment for our long-term growth prospects, and we're really confident we'll pay off in the long term. And with regard to the guidance, I mean, a quarter like Q2, 33.1% adjusted EBITDAC margin, it -- more than anything it makes us confident in our guide range and increases the likelihood that we'll end up at the high end of that range. And again, just to remind everyone, we had 25% margins in 2019. So our model definitely scales. And next year, we won't have the same margin impact from our hiring this year, so we feel very good about margin improvement as time goes on. But in the meantime, as you said, T&E is still ramping up. It's not ramping up as significantly as it was in '22 relative to '21, but still an impact there. And then the biggest impact again is just the annualization of last year's hiring. And we're not making outsized hires at that same scale but we are making a more normalized maintenance and growth level of hiring this year that we're really excited about.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. That's helpful. And the 3 M&A deals that you did in the quarter, does that impact your margin profile either favorably or adversely or maybe change the seasonality of your EBITDAC or revenue?\nJeremiah Bickham: They're too small to have an impact. And then generally, what we tell people is to think of acquisitions as coming on at the same margin and the same growth rate. If there's an acquisition that is significantly different enough and significant in size enough to move the needle, we will let investors know.\nWeston Bloomer: And then last question for me. I know you have a partnership with Nationwide and they had pulled out of those E&S commercial auto. Was there any impact of that within your numbers, or can you just comment on where that -- where your relationship is with them?\nTimothy Turner: Yes, we certainly noted Nationwide's withdrawal from commercial auto but we have a wide product line and several other carriers that we can employ and to absorb that business. We're expanding our transportation department as we've mentioned before, and we were ready for that change. The acquisition of Crouse and Associates really strengthened our bench and gave us a national breadth and depth in not just brokerage transportation but underwriting. So we're looking ahead and we can absorb and make those changes without any effect.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. Are you sizing that impact at all? That something you can...\nTimothy Turner: We're looking at double-digit growth in transportation in underwriting and in broking. We're creating facilities, MGUs, expanded binding authority product line and that really doesn't put or have any negative impact on our ability to grow.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Mike Zaremski of BMO Capital Markets.\nMichael Zaremski: My question is a follow-up to the question on margins relative to the pace of hiring. I guess are there any numbers you could help put context to the excess pace of hiring you made? I guess because we don't have as long of a history to kind of understand kind of -- we could see how many people you added in '22 versus '21, but we can't see the long-term average. So I'm just trying to get a sense of any context you could put around like did you -- was the pace of hiring 5 points more than you think is kind of \"normal,\" so we can kind of better understand try to size up the impact that's had to your margins?\nJeremiah Bickham: So I won't be able to put it in basis points for you, Mike, but think of it as over 1.5x normal sized production class relative to a normal year. And you're right, looking at headcount won't tell you the whole story because it's generally the production folks that are the needle mover. One thing we can tell you, and we said this a bunch, is that production classes as a cohort will cover their costs after 2 years and generally be margin accretive sometime in the third year. So that's why we're confident that the '22 class won't be weighing down margin come '24. And like I said, we're not onboarding an outsized class in '23. And if we only made normal size of hiring -- size hiring classes, there wouldn't be an impact in the following year. We can still scale somewhat if we're just hiring at an average level.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That does help. And just sticking to margins, just want to -- curious are there any other things changing on the margin, no pun intended, kind of like on commission rates, or, I don't know, just wage inflation we should be thinking about that would change versus 3 to 6 months ago that we should be contemplating as well?\nJeremiah Bickham: Nothing on commission rates. Those are stable. Great question. On wage inflation, we're not immune to it because there are plenty of folks here running around on salaries, but the majority of our comp expense is commission based and so doesn't get impacted by wage inflation the same way. So yes, it has an impact on us. I'm sure you've heard everyone talking about it, but it's not -- that alone wouldn't have the same margin impact that is worthy of as many references as we've made to what's happening in our comp margin. Right now, it's the sheer number of hires that we made last year on the production side.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And lastly, just you gave us some good commentary about flows into the E&S marketplace, but you also talked about there being even some appetite constraints within the E&S marketplace. But just curious, anything you've seen, any stats you want to talk about that you've seen in July, if you're seeing any change in acceleration or deceleration in flows over the past month?\nTimothy Turner: No, it's been quite steady. The flow has been measurable and increased in many lines, some deceleration as we talked about in public D&O and widely noted in cyber, but so many other lines, not just cat property, but many casualty lines continue to harden. And so the flow into the channel and our ability to capture it continues to get strength stronger, and we feel we're converting a higher percentage of that business and we've been building our bench for years to win as much of that business as we can. It's working out very well.\nMichael Zaremski: Tim, what casualty lines are there? Are they more kind of large account or small accounts? And I promise that's my last follow-up.\nTimothy Turner: No problem. It's a combination of small commercial, certainly in our binding authorities and our MGUs, but it's larger brokerage business as well, large habitational schedules in the casualty side continue to pour into our channel. Residential construction, New York construction to name a few, transportation, as we've mentioned. Health care, nursing homes, assisted living, certain social and different types of health care. Sports and entertainment continue to be a very difficult line where they need our help, consumer products. And maybe lastly, public entity, real demand for property and casualty solutions in the specialty side across the whole public entity sector.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Rob Cox of Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: So I noticed the adjusted compensation margin was down a good bit year-over-year despite the talent investments, but the adjusted G&A ratio was higher than the first quarter when it's seasonally lower. So I would have thought that would be a little bit lower. I think as the first quarter, if I recall correctly, was your toughest comp with respect to travel and entertainment. So is there any additional color you can provide there?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. A little bit of that -- or I shouldn't say a little -- some of that is T&E. And then another bit of that is professional services that increased significantly this quarter relative to prior quarters related to a new revenue stream that just requires additional professional services. Over time that may waterbed into comp if we decide to in-house some of those. But for right now, they're through professional services.\nRobert Cox: Got it. And maybe just another question on the state of California, which I think is nearly 15% of the E&S market based on data that we look at. I think it's been a net drag on overall E&S industry premium since November of last year. But we've seen it tick up positively in the double digits in the last 2 months, which I suspect might be driven by personal lines and property. So I'm wondering if you see growth in California in the back half of the year and how well positioned Ryan is to potentially take advantage of some of those tailwinds, if they're there.\nTimothy Turner: We're very well positioned in the state of California. We have multiple offices, 2 of our last large brokerage acquisitions are in the state of California. We've strengthened ourselves there, deep benches in property and casualty and binding. We're building and finishing up a high-net-worth personal lines facility to complement what we've already been doing in personal lines. So we're there to capture that business and to deliver for our clients across California and the West Coast.\nRobert Cox: That's great. And maybe if I could sneak in 1 more on cyber. Tim, I think -- I noted you had recently stated that the cyber market is getting skittish again, but I think there's still pricing declines in that market. So I guess my question is, are you growing in that market? And do you expect growth to pick up or slowdown in the back half of the year?\nTimothy Turner: Well, there's no question there's rate deceleration and the flow has slowed a bit. But we're still capitalizing on it. It's still a very great opportunity for us. We're well positioned in binding authorities, MGUs which Miles Wuller can talk about a little further. But our cyber team is #1 in the country, and they're performing at a very high level. Our clients still need us. Miles?\nMiles Wuller: Yes, I'll chime in that. So we have noted deceleration Cyber previously, and there has been modest negative change, most observable on the excess layers. But please keep in mind this was relative to market, particularly us achieving 85% rate increase in the first half of last year. So investments by corporate risk managers that curb losses, substantial price hikes that helped rate adequacy. It has brought some new capital space. But however, despite the shift in pricing, the overall opportunity remains immense, the cyber threats persist and where the industry is still anticipating, structural growth is averaging 20% per annum for the foreseeable future. So we're well positioned with people and product to capitalize on that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question we have is from Meyer Shields of KBW.\nMeyer Shields: I want to follow up on cyber if I can. Is there any seasonality analogous to what we're seeing in property where cyber is a bigger factor in a particular quarter?\nMiles Wuller: There is not material seasonality to Cyber.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. And second question, I think this is probably for Jeremiah. Very significant pickup in fiduciary assets going from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter. Is the seasonality that we've seen historically still a good proxy for how fiduciary funds will come and go?\nJeremiah Bickham: When you say recently, are you talking about first half of this year or since you've been following us? I just want to make sure I understand the question.\nMeyer Shields: I mean first half this year, in other words. We saw a pretty big increase going from the first quarter to second quarter last year and also this year. And just wondering whether that the ebbs and flows should be roughly the same every year.\nJeremiah Bickham: I was actually talking to the Treasurer about this earlier this week. I would classify everything that you're seeing in our fiduciary balances as normal factors and timing that can happen. There's been no change to our DSO, no material change to business mix, even though the different -- obviously, wholesale and delegated authority do have different payment terms and DSO. When we acquire businesses will impact fiduciary balances, but there's nothing to read into in terms of a material change. It's normal timing factors.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. And then a final question, if I can, for Tim. It sounds based on everything that we're saying that maybe T&E growth will slow down because we're lapping normal quarters. Are you seeing competitors pull back on that? Is there a specific opportunity from that particular aspect of marketing?\nTimothy Turner: No, we're not seeing any real pullback on that. But I'm not sure I understood the question. Could you repeat that?\nMeyer Shields: Yes. I'm just wondering with travel and entertainment observably much more expensive. I'm wondering whether you're starting to see some competitors say we're just going to do less of that and whether there's an opportunity for growth when that happens.\nTimothy Turner: No, I haven't seen that. In fact, I think it's as competitive in our space as it's ever been. We're attending events and on the road seeing our clients and our underwriters continuously. We're back to full speed ahead, and I don't see any pullback from our competitors actually.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Michael Ward of Citi.\nMichael Ward: Was wondering in benefits what capabilities you might be looking to add. Is it more medical stop loss or other areas?\nPatrick Ryan: Yes. It's -- medical stop loss as I'm sure you know, is rapidly growing, moving from fully funded benefit plans to self-insured plans. And what interests us greatly is the phenomenon of the size of employer who was moving into self-insured and funding through group captives. In other words, pooling with other employers -- employer groups of similar size, characteristics. And so our strategy is an integrated health solution heavily driven through self-insured clients who ultimately we believe in large numbers are going to want to be funding that by putting up some of their own capital and group captives. So it's a process of providing services to retail brokers who may not have the resources to provide these services. And frankly, an ability through our professional skills of the talented team that we've assembled to bring innovative, integrated health solutions, coupled with the self-insured plans that I talked about and then bringing a very innovative funding mechanism. So we believe that the benefit strategy that we have is going to be significantly accretive to our total addressable market. We'll be picking up a lot of clients that we believe will be interested in what we're offering. And then we think we have cross-selling opportunities into the P&C side. So we're very excited about that.\nMichael Ward: That's helpful. And then maybe just on the 2025 savings plan, I think you mentioned this, but could we -- should we potentially be expecting to see savings a little bit earlier than that, or timing still the same?\nJeremiah Bickham: No timing is -- we're a little bit ahead of schedule on execution, but the material impact to the P&L is on the same schedule. So no saves this year. Some in '24, which will be reflected in our guidance next year and then the full annual $35 million in '25.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Tracy Benguigui of Barclays.\nJeremiah Bickham: Tracy, do we have you?\nTracy Benguigui: Can you hear me?\nJeremiah Bickham: We can now.\nTracy Benguigui: Can you hear me?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes.\nTracy Benguigui: Sorry. It would be great to learn more about your property E&S wholesale brokering and underwriting management capabilities. Are you more known by the market on the transactional E&S side or you're more known in the larger property direct and facultative market?\nMiles Wuller: Tracy, it's Miles Wuller. So I'll start on the delegate authority side. So our property capabilities span habitational property, builders risk, renewables, energy and most certainly cap property. We're able to efficiently service both the middle market, as well as large accounts. Our cat practice is predominantly shared and layered, working some of the largest and most complex risks out there. And so as far as positioning and expectations, so we've noted previously that with our results and expert teams, we increased cat capacity post Ian. And I'm pleased to say we continue to add cat commitments even as recently as this week. So we've been prudent deploying our cat aggregate and have substantial dry powder, which points a continued great contribution into the end of the year.\nTimothy Turner: And I would just add, our brokerage capabilities are industry-leading. We've been capturing a high percentage of this new business pouring into the channel. I believe our outstanding leadership team in the brokerage cat property arena is doing a fabulous job, and that was a big part of our success in the quarter. We look forward to capturing other difficult property risk as we move on through the year. There's much more to it than just cat wind.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Excellent. There's a number of new E&S carriers, including some U.K. insurers, which may be a move to be more efficient on the Lloyd's distribution efforts. What I'd like to know is, does this move just cut 1 layer in that value chain, like business you would have seen anyway? Or does bypassing Lloyd's give you a new business opportunity?\nTimothy Turner: No, I would say that net positive on that is it enhances and strengthens our ability to market the business. Lloyd's is obviously an industry leader in the E&S market but there's multiple access points, and they're a major player in our binding authorities, our MGUs, open brokerage, London access points. So it's a heavy-duty player and then creating these 2 E&S facilities that we've been reading about, I see that as a very positive influence on our ability to solve these catastrophic challenges.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Just to be clear, that business you would have seen anyway or is that new business that you would now see?\nTimothy Turner: It's a combination of new and renewal business that just enhances our capabilities and strengthen them.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the delay. We'll move on to our next question, which is coming from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Just another follow-up on cyber, trying to understand some of the businesses that are capable of moving the needle on your organic when you have sharp inflections. Obviously, we know D&O can do it, property can do it. But is cyber 1 of those businesses where we really do have big pricing swings? It's something that can notably move your headline organic growth rate?\nJeremiah Bickham: So I would just say broadly -- this is Jeremiah, Ryan. Cyber, think of that as a product category, which is we've said publicly is there's no product that's more than single digits in terms of our overall portfolio. In the case of cyber, it's low single digits versus property, which is an entire category of products making up a very significant part of the portfolio. So they're apples and oranges really. Cyber is worth talking about it because it's an important topic for insureds, it's an important weapon in the arsenal of our professional lines team and there's a lot going on. And as Miles said, the opportunity sets big enough where we do expect that it will be a feature worth talking about as time goes on. But it's not the -- it's not as material, for example, as like D&O -- as public D&O has been over the last several quarters.\nMiles Wuller: And Ryan, I'll jump in that even though rate is under pressure, we continue to find ways to grow through new products, new clients and incremental capacity. So we are achieving growth. And I also think it's important to note that it has been -- last year was a relatively benign loss year. A lot of people were looking for how comes out of the Ukraine-Russia conflict that did materialize. But there are increases in attach year-over-year. There's -- there have been some malware incidents. And so the threat remains a very active risk environment.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then on the property side, just trying to think about the longevity of this. So would you say that like are the carriers generally coming to market and getting the rate that they think they need on property placements this year? Or would you characterize it more as there being some type of understanding that in the marketplace getting to whatever their views of rate adequacy may take multiple renewals.\nTimothy Turner: I would say more of the latter. They're continuing to get increases. The losses continue to come in. As you know, global warming is not going away, it's creating more and more convective storm activity, the wildfire phenomenon. There's just a lot of tentacles to this issue. And we see prices going up, we see capacity shrinking. What took 10 or 20 carriers to build $100 million tower last year, now takes twice as many. Most carriers are shortening their lines, tightening their terms and conditions and continuing to raise their prices. So I don't think we're anywhere near close to where the market can go. The convective storms are really doing damage to balance sheets. The modeling has been off in this area. And so we're -- our services and our products are needed well beyond the cat wind aspect of property.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then just one last follow-up for Jeremiah. I apologize if I missed this, but could you give us some idea of what the acquired revenues are on the 3 deals you completed this quarter?\nJeremiah Bickham: It was about $40 million in aggregate.\nOperator: Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back to management for any closing remarks.\nPatrick Ryan: Well, thank you all very much. Good questions, and thanks for your support and interest in our company. We look forward to speaking to you again at the end of the third quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference and webcast. We thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Tim. In Q2, we grew total revenue 19.1% period-over-period to $585 million fueled by another strong quarter of organic revenue growth at 16.1% as we continue to benefit from the ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market, particularly property, broad-based strength in many of our individual lines and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business.  Net income for Q2 '23 was $84 million or $0.26 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $124 million or $0.45 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the second quarter grew 16.9% period-over-period to $194 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 60 basis points to 33.2%. Our EBITDAC margin was impacted by continued investments in our business, including last year's hiring and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels, both of which were partially offset by higher fiduciary investment income.  Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program. We had approximately $17 million of charges in the quarter as the program was able to move into full swing, slightly ahead of schedule. We remain well on track to generate annual savings of at least $35 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges projected to be at least $65 million through the end of 2024.  As Pat noted, we also continued to make targeted investments in the quarter, adding underwriting and broking talent to our ranks and expect consistent recruitment efforts to continue in the back half of the year. The cost of these investments, along with the annualization of our 2022 headcount growth, will continue to impact margin but will be partially offset by increases in fiduciary investment income. These investments in talent, particularly recruiting new colleagues, offer the highest returns for our shareholders and are part of a proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense, which is net of interest income on our operating funds of approximately $31 million in Q3 and $29 million in Q4. As a quick reminder, we paid for our 3 most recently announced acquisitions at the beginning of Q3, which reduced our operating funds relative to the 6/30 balance sheet. We are now guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2023 to be between 13.0% and 14.5%, up from our previous guide range of 10.5% to 13.0%. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin guidance range of 29.0% to 30.0%.  In summary, it was an excellent second quarter and first half performance by Ryan Specialty. We remain very excited for both our near- and long-term prospects.  With that, we thank you for your time, and we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Hi, Elyse, thanks for the question. So first off, I just want to acknowledge, we had a very good quarter that we're quite proud of and really the end to a very solid first half of the year. As you noted in our prepared remarks, we got a big boost from property this quarter. And because seasonally, Q2 has the highest amount of property and property cat business in our portfolio, that's why. And thus, we are expecting less of a lift from property in the second half of the year. But otherwise, we're implying that H2 will play out very similarly to H1, which means strong growth across the board, including double-digit growth contribution from our very balanced casualty portfolio as well. So overall, we feel great about where we're headed in H2, and we're very confident we can land within our increased organic growth guide range, which we feel would represent another very solid year for Ryan Specialty. So Q2 is far and away the largest. And if you're just looking at percentage attribution of business, it doesn't even tell the whole story because not only does it have the highest overall property contribution but it's the highest cat property quarter of the year by far. The next highest is Q4, but we did experience a benefit in the last couple of weeks of Q4 from property rates surging. So we're not counting on the exact same growth in Q4 proportionately as we would a quarter like Q2 if that makes sense. Yes. Thank you, Weston. So as we said for multiple quarters now, the biggest impact to our margin at the moment is our outsized hiring activity from last year, which we know is the right investment for our long-term growth prospects, and we're really confident we'll pay off in the long term. And with regard to the guidance, I mean, a quarter like Q2, 33.1% adjusted EBITDAC margin, it -- more than anything it makes us confident in our guide range and increases the likelihood that we'll end up at the high end of that range. And again, just to remind everyone, we had 25% margins in 2019. So our model definitely scales. And next year, we won't have the same margin impact from our hiring this year, so we feel very good about margin improvement as time goes on. But in the meantime, as you said, T&E is still ramping up. It's not ramping up as significantly as it was in '22 relative to '21, but still an impact there. And then the biggest impact again is just the annualization of last year's hiring. And we're not making outsized hires at that same scale but we are making a more normalized maintenance and growth level of hiring this year that we're really excited about. They're too small to have an impact. And then generally, what we tell people is to think of acquisitions as coming on at the same margin and the same growth rate. If there's an acquisition that is significantly different enough and significant in size enough to move the needle, we will let investors know. So I won't be able to put it in basis points for you, Mike, but think of it as over 1.5x normal sized production class relative to a normal year. And you're right, looking at headcount won't tell you the whole story because it's generally the production folks that are the needle mover. One thing we can tell you, and we said this a bunch, is that production classes as a cohort will cover their costs after 2 years and generally be margin accretive sometime in the third year. So that's why we're confident that the '22 class won't be weighing down margin come '24. And like I said, we're not onboarding an outsized class in '23. And if we only made normal size of hiring -- size hiring classes, there wouldn't be an impact in the following year. We can still scale somewhat if we're just hiring at an average level. Nothing on commission rates. Those are stable. Great question. On wage inflation, we're not immune to it because there are plenty of folks here running around on salaries, but the majority of our comp expense is commission based and so doesn't get impacted by wage inflation the same way. So yes, it has an impact on us. I'm sure you've heard everyone talking about it, but it's not -- that alone wouldn't have the same margin impact that is worthy of as many references as we've made to what's happening in our comp margin. Right now, it's the sheer number of hires that we made last year on the production side. Yes. A little bit of that -- or I shouldn't say a little -- some of that is T&E. And then another bit of that is professional services that increased significantly this quarter relative to prior quarters related to a new revenue stream that just requires additional professional services. Over time that may waterbed into comp if we decide to in-house some of those. But for right now, they're through professional services. When you say recently, are you talking about first half of this year or since you've been following us? I just want to make sure I understand the question. I was actually talking to the Treasurer about this earlier this week. I would classify everything that you're seeing in our fiduciary balances as normal factors and timing that can happen. There's been no change to our DSO, no material change to business mix, even though the different -- obviously, wholesale and delegated authority do have different payment terms and DSO. When we acquire businesses will impact fiduciary balances, but there's nothing to read into in terms of a material change. It's normal timing factors. No timing is -- we're a little bit ahead of schedule on execution, but the material impact to the P&L is on the same schedule. So no saves this year. Some in '24, which will be reflected in our guidance next year and then the full annual $35 million in '25. Tracy, do we have you? We can now. Yes. So I would just say broadly -- this is Jeremiah, Ryan. Cyber, think of that as a product category, which is we've said publicly is there's no product that's more than single digits in terms of our overall portfolio. In the case of cyber, it's low single digits versus property, which is an entire category of products making up a very significant part of the portfolio. So they're apples and oranges really. Cyber is worth talking about it because it's an important topic for insureds, it's an important weapon in the arsenal of our professional lines team and there's a lot going on.

But it's not the -- it's not as material, for example, as like D&O -- as public D&O has been over the last several quarters. It was about $40 million in aggregate."

            "name": "Patrick Ryan",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results. With me on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller; and Nick Mezick from Investor Relations. Ryan Specialty had a great quarter with strong momentum continuing across all of our strategic financial and operational objectives. We grew total revenue of 19.1% led by organic growth of 16.1%, building on the 22.3% organic growth in the second quarter of 2022. We also achieved double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. We saw broad-based strength across our specialties, particularly in property and in many individual lines of business. The specific headwinds we noted on our prior calls were in line with our expectations and partially offset some of the very strong tailwinds we experienced in property. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance in the quarter and throughout the first half of 2023. In addition to delivering great results, we continue to execute on our M&A strategy. In July, we completed 3 attractive and strategic acquisitions, which added scale and scope to our Wholesale specialty and lost our benefits practice. The first is Socius Insurance Services. Approximately $40 million of annual revenue Socius adds high-quality talent to our professional lines and cyber teams and deepens our scale and scope in key hubs like San Francisco, Tampa and Miami. We are confident in the outlook for this business, given our long-standing familiarity with the team and our proven ability to help firms grow on our platform through our relationships with the top 100 retail brokers access to our proprietary products and expand carrier relationships. We also completed 2 employee benefits acquisitions. Point6 Healthcare and ACE benefit partners, adding just under $10 million of annual revenue. These firms provide exceptional talent and foundational capabilities for Ryan Specialty Benefits. We have diligently assessed opportunities in the benefits market, targeting firms that have a track record of both growth and long-term margin greater than the industry average. And these medical stop-loss focus firms are perfectly aligned with those attributes. Medical stop-loss insurance plays the vital role by smoothing the volatility in health care spend through reinsuring a self-funded benefits plan against high-cost claims. We expect medical stop-loss insurance to continue to play a crucial role in financing and risk mitigation strategies, particularly as health care innovation accelerate in high-cost drugs and gene therapies become more prevalent. We are pleased to enter this niche that boasts over $25 billion in premium in the U.S. with a 12% compound annual growth rate since 2014. We believe there is a long runway for both organic and inorganic growth in benefits and are excited to have these capabilities to our specialties.  Further on the M&A front, our pipeline remains robust. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions, particularly in the current environment, as we will only move forward when all of our criteria are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. We continue to make targeted investments during the quarter as we brought on additional talent to further enhance our current capabilities and develop areas where we anticipate our clients need us in the future. These investments, particularly in the recruitment of new colleagues offer the greatest returns for our shareholders and are part of a proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. That takes us to ACCELERATE 2025, our 2-year restructuring program announced earlier this year. We are making investments that will enable continued growth, drive innovation, deliver sustainable productivity increases over the long term and accelerate margin improvement. We have made solid progress in the second quarter, which Jeremiah will discuss further. We remain on track to generate a targeted annual savings of at least $35 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges expected to be at least $65 million through the end of 2024. Throughout the second quarter, the E&S marketplace remained robust. E&S continues to provide solutions that are otherwise not available for hard-to-place risks. As we previously noted, we've invested significantly in those lines where we see clear opportunities to grow in addition to bolstering the lines of business our clients need us the most. We've also continued to expand our ability to serve brokers, agents and carriers through innovation and creating alternatives to traditional insurance placements in areas like cat property and transportation. Looking ahead, we expect favorable specialty insurance market dynamics to persist, and we remain confident that 2023 will continue to be another strong year for our firm. We are in a prime position to capture broader E&S tailwinds and also further capitalize on our specific lines of accelerated growth. Our differentiated business model allows us to remain ahead of the competition, and our flexibility enables us to quickly adapt and pivot when market conditions shift. We continue to expand our total addressable market through innovation and strategic acquisitions and further deepen our moat with scale, scope of intellectual capital. We're able to do all of this because of our exceptional team, who consistently deliver impressive results and value for our clients trading partners and ultimately, to our shareholders.  Now I'm pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim? Thank you, Elyse. The -- it looks good. As I said, it's a robust pipeline. We are in discussions on additional benefits opportunities that will help round out our offering to our clients, add some significant new management talent and production talent. There's no way of knowing when, but it could be quite soon. We're in serious discussions. Yes. It's -- medical stop loss as I'm sure you know, is rapidly growing, moving from fully funded benefit plans to self-insured plans. And what interests us greatly is the phenomenon of the size of employer who was moving into self-insured and funding through group captives. In other words, pooling with other employers -- employer groups of similar size, characteristics. And so our strategy is an integrated health solution heavily driven through self-insured clients who ultimately we believe in large numbers are going to want to be funding that by putting up some of their own capital and group captives. So it's a process of providing services to retail brokers who may not have the resources to provide these services. And frankly, an ability through our professional skills of the talented team that we've assembled to bring innovative, integrated health solutions, coupled with the self-insured plans that I talked about and then bringing a very innovative funding mechanism. So we believe that the benefit strategy that we have is going to be significantly accretive to our total addressable market. We'll be picking up a lot of clients that we believe will be interested in what we're offering. And then we think we have cross-selling opportunities into the P&C side. So we're very excited about that. Well, thank you all very much. Good questions, and thanks for your support and interest in our company. We look forward to speaking to you again at the end of the third quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Miles Wuller",
            "content": "Yes, I'll chime in that. So we have noted deceleration Cyber previously, and there has been modest negative change, most observable on the excess layers. But please keep in mind this was relative to market, particularly us achieving 85% rate increase in the first half of last year. So investments by corporate risk managers that curb losses, substantial price hikes that helped rate adequacy. It has brought some new capital space. But however, despite the shift in pricing, the overall opportunity remains immense, the cyber threats persist and where the industry is still anticipating, structural growth is averaging 20% per annum for the foreseeable future. So we're well positioned with people and product to capitalize on that. There is not material seasonality to Cyber. Tracy, it's Miles Wuller. So I'll start on the delegate authority side. So our property capabilities span habitational property, builders risk, renewables, energy and most certainly cap property. We're able to efficiently service both the middle market, as well as large accounts. Our cat practice is predominantly shared and layered, working some of the largest and most complex risks out there. And so as far as positioning and expectations, so we've noted previously that with our results and expert teams, we increased cat capacity post Ian. And I'm pleased to say we continue to add cat commitments even as recently as this week. So we've been prudent deploying our cat aggregate and have substantial dry powder, which points a continued great contribution into the end of the year. And Ryan, I'll jump in that even though rate is under pressure, we continue to find ways to grow through new products, new clients and incremental capacity. So we are achieving growth. And I also think it's important to note that it has been -- last year was a relatively benign loss year. A lot of people were looking for how comes out of the Ukraine-Russia conflict that did materialize. But there are increases in attach year-over-year. There's -- there have been some malware incidents. And so the threat remains a very active risk environment."

            "name": "Timothy Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. As Pat noted, it was another strong quarter across our specialties as we continue to successfully execute on winning new business and producing innovative solutions for our clients. The effects of industry trends such as climate change and natural disasters, accelerating social inflation and broad-based economic inflation happening concurrently with reduced insurance capital, a pullback in underwriter appetite and market exits make for an incredibly challenging insurance market.  Additionally, continuous change in the loss environment and growing uncertainty in reserve adequacy is driving more risks into the E&S marketplace, which offers significantly more freedom of rate and form. Given our specialized and industry-leading team's ability to navigate the complexities of the market, we plan to continue delivering for our clients and expect to further expand our market share.  Diving into our specialties. Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty generated another quarter of strong growth. In property, elevated levels of attritional and secondary perils, including severe convective storms and persistent inflation from higher cost of materials and labor shortages are driving up loss costs. Additionally, market conditions, including higher reinsurance costs, reduction in available capacity and ongoing requirements for proper valuations are driving higher retentions of risk and ultimately more volatility into the U.S. direct property market. These factors are continuing to drive flow of new business into the E&S market.  The E&S market is responding, yet it is also experiencing more conservative appetites, significant rate increases and tighter limit management, especially on coastal property, severe convective storms, wildfire, flood and earthquake risk. We are well positioned to assist our clients in navigating the complexities of this market. Our A+ team of experts are working tirelessly to bring important and creative solutions to our retail brokers and trading partners in this challenging market.  Our transportation practice continued to see substantial flow in the quarter fueled by social inflation, carrier need for continued rate increases and a pullback in underwriter appetite and market exits. We continue to win more than our fair share of new business and remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities.  Our casualty practice also performed very well in the quarter. We continue to see higher loss trends, inflation and reserving issues, drive more flow into the E&S channel across both primary and excess casualty, particularly in lines like health care, habitational and real estate. And as Pat noted, we completed the acquisition of Socius at the beginning of July, and are excited about the addition of new teammates who have hit the ground running and are a clear cultural match with Ryan Specialty. Overall, our Wholesale Brokerage specialty continues to successfully execute its game plan, and we see a long runway of consistent growth ahead.  In our Binding Authority specialty, we saw another quarter of solid growth in traditional binding, which includes small commercial business and growth in personal lines despite continued capacity constraints. We continue to see further potential for panel consolidation as a long and steady growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to execute.  Our Underwriting Management specialty also generated strong results led by continued steady and profitable growth in property and casualty and our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re. We also launched our benefits practice with the acquisitions of Point6 Healthcare and ACE Benefit Partners. Our team was extremely thoughtful in determining where we could best add value in this large and important market and medical stop loss is where we see a clear opportunity for rapid expansion within this fast-growing specialty niche. John Zern and his team are hard at work expanding our sales force in this practice. We look forward to updating you on the progress of benefits in the quarters ahead.  As we had mentioned on our prior call and as Pat just noted, the specific headwinds in certain lines in the second quarter, namely public company D&O, lower external M&A volumes and transactional liability and delayed starts in construction remained in line with our expectations. We expect any growth benefit in these 3 lines to be modest in the second half of the year.  Turning to price. Through Q2, we remained in the prolonged stages of a historically hard market. Pricing in the E&S market largely held firm or accelerated in many lines of business with property continuing to see the strongest rate momentum. Exceptions remain public company D&O and cyber where we saw further pressure as with all cycles. As pricing continues to increase and certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy, we see admitted markets step back in on certain placements particularly within large towers. But overall, we still have yet to see the standard market meaningfully impact rate or flow in the aggregate.  We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialties growth more so than rate.  With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our second quarter. Thank you. Yes, we certainly noted Nationwide's withdrawal from commercial auto but we have a wide product line and several other carriers that we can employ and to absorb that business. We're expanding our transportation department as we've mentioned before, and we were ready for that change. The acquisition of Crouse and Associates really strengthened our bench and gave us a national breadth and depth in not just brokerage transportation but underwriting. So we're looking ahead and we can absorb and make those changes without any effect. We're looking at double-digit growth in transportation in underwriting and in broking. We're creating facilities, MGUs, expanded binding authority product line and that really doesn't put or have any negative impact on our ability to grow. No, it's been quite steady. The flow has been measurable and increased in many lines, some deceleration as we talked about in public D&O and widely noted in cyber, but so many other lines, not just cat property, but many casualty lines continue to harden. And so the flow into the channel and our ability to capture it continues to get strength stronger, and we feel we're converting a higher percentage of that business and we've been building our bench for years to win as much of that business as we can. It's working out very well. No problem. It's a combination of small commercial, certainly in our binding authorities and our MGUs, but it's larger brokerage business as well, large habitational schedules in the casualty side continue to pour into our channel. Residential construction, New York construction to name a few, transportation, as we've mentioned. Health care, nursing homes, assisted living, certain social and different types of health care. Sports and entertainment continue to be a very difficult line where they need our help, consumer products. And maybe lastly, public entity, real demand for property and casualty solutions in the specialty side across the whole public entity sector. We're very well positioned in the state of California. We have multiple offices, 2 of our last large brokerage acquisitions are in the state of California. We've strengthened ourselves there, deep benches in property and casualty and binding. We're building and finishing up a high-net-worth personal lines facility to complement what we've already been doing in personal lines. So we're there to capture that business and to deliver for our clients across California and the West Coast. Well, there's no question there's rate deceleration and the flow has slowed a bit. But we're still capitalizing on it. It's still a very great opportunity for us. We're well positioned in binding authorities, MGUs which Miles Wuller can talk about a little further. But our cyber team is #1 in the country, and they're performing at a very high level. Our clients still need us. Miles? No, we're not seeing any real pullback on that. But I'm not sure I understood the question. Could you repeat that? No, I haven't seen that. In fact, I think it's as competitive in our space as it's ever been. We're attending events and on the road seeing our clients and our underwriters continuously. We're back to full speed ahead, and I don't see any pullback from our competitors actually. And I would just add, our brokerage capabilities are industry-leading. We've been capturing a high percentage of this new business pouring into the channel. I believe our outstanding leadership team in the brokerage cat property arena is doing a fabulous job, and that was a big part of our success in the quarter. We look forward to capturing other difficult property risk as we move on through the year. There's much more to it than just cat wind. No, I would say that net positive on that is it enhances and strengthens our ability to market the business. Lloyd's is obviously an industry leader in the E&S market but there's multiple access points, and they're a major player in our binding authorities, our MGUs, open brokerage, London access points. So it's a heavy-duty player and then creating these 2 E&S facilities that we've been reading about, I see that as a very positive influence on our ability to solve these catastrophic challenges. It's a combination of new and renewal business that just enhances our capabilities and strengthen them. I would say more of the latter. They're continuing to get increases. The losses continue to come in. As you know, global warming is not going away, it's creating more and more convective storm activity, the wildfire phenomenon. There's just a lot of tentacles to this issue. And we see prices going up, we see capacity shrinking. What took 10 or 20 carriers to build $100 million tower last year, now takes twice as many. Most carriers are shortening their lines, tightening their terms and conditions and continuing to raise their prices. So I don't think we're anywhere near close to where the market can go. The convective storms are really doing damage to balance sheets. The modeling has been off in this area. And so we're -- our services and our products are needed well beyond the cat wind aspect of property."

With me on today\u2019s call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller; along with Noah Angeletti and Nick Mezick from Investor Relations. First quarter represents a great start to the year. We grew total revenue 18.3% led by organic growth of 12.9%, building on 20.1% organic growth in the first quarter of 2022. We also achieved double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. In the first quarter, we saw a broad-based strength in many lines of business, including continued growth in property. The specific headwinds we noted on our prior calls were in line with our expectations and offset some of our property tailwinds. We anticipate that these headwinds will persist into at least the second quarter. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the volatile macroeconomic environment. Despite headlines in the banking sector, persistent inflation and heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe our firm will continue to perform well through this economic cycle. Our products are largely compulsory. And as risks become ever more complex, we are uniquely positioned to provide our clients with the experience, expertise and innovation they require to seamlessly manage their insurance needs. Growth in the E&S marketplace continues to outpace the overall P&C insurance market and is providing solutions that would not otherwise be attainable or hard-to-place risks. Given today\u2019s macroeconomic and broader insurance challenges, the E&S market is resilient, nimble and offers Ryan Specialty a tremendous opportunity for growth. Specific to Ryan Specialty, our specialized and industry-leading broker teams navigated the complexities of the market, including each of the micro cycles within the hundreds of lines that comprise commercial insurance, providing solutions that are uniquely tailored to our clients\u2019 needs. Our delegated authority specialties and binding and underwriting management continue to generate underwriting profit on behalf of our trading partners and delivered strong top line growth. The widespread marketing exercises and strong relationships with our carrier trading partners, our experts find coverage for hard-to-place risks by crafting and weaving together large towers of capacity for our clients. This is particularly valued by our clients and insurers in a challenging insurance market. We have also expanded our ability to serve brokers, agents and carriers through innovation and the creation of alternatives to traditional insurance placements. This is especially meaningful in areas like CAT property and transportation. We continue to serve our clients and trading partners with distinction thanks to the exceptional team we\u2019ve assembled since our founding, and we take great pride in developing the next generation of teammates and leaders. We continue to make targeted investments during the quarter, adding underwriters and brokers to further deepen our current capabilities and develop areas we anticipate our clients will need in the future. To that end, we seamlessly picked up from where we left off in 2022 when we onboarded the largest production class in our history. These investments, particularly in the recruitment of new colleagues, offer the greatest returns for our shareholders and are part of our proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. On the M&A front, our pipeline remains robust, including opportunities that would bring foundational capabilities and wholesale employee benefits. As a reminder, we closed the highly strategic acquisition, Griffin Underwriting Services, at the beginning of the year, and it is contributing to both our binding authority and brokerage specialties. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions, particularly in the current environment, as we will only move forward when all of our criteria are met. Every acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive as is evident by our consistently strong performance. We do not require acquisitions to achieve our growth targets in any given period. Looking ahead, I remain confident that 2023 will be another strong year for our firm. We are well positioned to capture the broader E&S tailwinds while capitalizing on our specific areas of accelerated growth. Our flexible business model continues to enable us to quickly adapt and pivot to ever-changing market conditions. I\u2019m proud of our entire team for staying focused and delivering outstanding results for our clients, trading partners and shareholders. Our differentiated business model continues to stand apart from the competition and sets us up to continue delivering significant value for years to come. Now I\u2019m pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim?\nTim Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. We had a strong start to 2023 across our specialties, and our entire team remains determined to maintain that momentum throughout the year. Ongoing industry trends, such as social inflation, climate change and older mass tort claims, combined with economic inflation are driving more risks into the E&S marketplace, which offers significantly more freedom of rate and form. We remain well positioned to continue successfully executing our playbook. Diving into our specialties. Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty achieved another quarter of strong growth, balanced across most lines of business. In property, we are seeing multiple forces at play, including recent year\u2019s elevated loss activity for both attritional and secondary perils, inflation driving higher costs of materials and labor, higher reinsurance pricing and diminished capital levels. This has led to a historically hard market, which continued into April with significant rate increases. We expect the hard property market to continue as the effects of reinsurers derisking their portfolios at January 1 and April 1 reinsurance renewals are felt and as insurers approach a continued challenging renewal at 6/1 and 7/1. These factors are driving the flow of new business into the non-admitted market, and our industry-leading team of experts allow us to fill that need with innovative insurance solutions. We believe property will continue to be a strong driver of growth in 2023. Our transportation practice had another strong quarter and continues to see substantial flow fueled by social inflation and carrier need for continued rate increases. We continue to win our fair share of business and remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities. In our casualty practice, we are seeing higher loss trends, inflation and reserving issues that are driving more flow into the E&S channel, particularly in lines like health care, sports and entertainment, higher education, habitational and real estate. Regarding the recent events in the banking sector, to date, we have seen only a modest impact on D&O focused on the banking sector. While losses may end up being material to the market, at this time, we do not see a systemic risk for D&O insurers or any signs the market is materially hardening. However, there remains some uncertainty about further banking failures, and we are closely monitoring the market as the risks evolve. But especially in times of uncertainty, our producers add value and deliver the best solutions to our clients. We believe Wholesale Brokerage is well positioned to grow consistently in the coming months and years. In our Binding Authority specialty, we saw another quarter of solid growth in traditional binding, which includes smaller commercial businesses somewhat limited by capacity constraints in personal lines. We continue to see further potential for panel consolidation as a long and steady growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to execute. Our Underwriting Management specialty continued to post strong results led by steady and profitable growth in property and casualty and our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re. As Pat noted, the specific headwinds in certain lines in the first quarter were in line with our expectations. Specifically, we saw a rapid rate decline in public company D&O, lower external M&A and IPO volumes and transactional liability and delayed project-based starts and construction. Pricing in the E&S market largely held firm or is accelerating in many lines of business with property continuing to see the most rate momentum. Exceptions are public company D&O where we saw further rate pressure and cyber, which is now seeing modest rate declines. As with all cycles, as pricing continues to increase and certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy, we see admitted markets step back in on certain placements, particularly within large towers. But overall, the standard market carrier competition has yet to meaningfully impact rate or flow in the aggregate. As we frequently noted, we expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty\u2019s growth, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our first quarter. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. In Q1, we grew total revenue 18.3% period-over-period to $458 million fueled by another strong quarter of organic revenue growth at 12.9% as we continue to see the benefit of ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market, broad-based strength in many of our lines including property and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business. Net income for Q1 2023 was $36 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $72 million or $0.26 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the first quarter grew 16.5% period-over-period to $125 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 40 basis points to 27.3%. Our EBITDAC margin was impacted by continued investments in our business and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels, both of which were partially offset by higher fiduciary investment income. Regarding our adjusted EBITDAC margin, on a seasonal basis, the second and fourth quarters are historically our largest quarters in terms of revenue and therefore the strongest in terms of margin, while the first and third quarters are typically smaller and lower from a margin perspective. Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program. We had a small charge in the quarter, and we expect charges to ramp up in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024. As a result, very little P&L savings will materialize this year. Savings will gradually increase as 2024 progresses, and we remain on track to generate annual savings of $35 million in 2025. We made significant progress in the first quarter in onboarding additional underwriting and broking talent, and we expect that our recruitment efforts will continue as we progress throughout the year. Cost of these investments, along with the annualization of our 2022 headcount growth, will be partially offset by increases in fiduciary investment income during 2023. As Pat said, these investments in talent, particularly in the recruitment of new colleagues, offer the highest return for our shareholders and are part of a proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. We are now guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2023 to be between 10.5% and 13.0%, which reflects an increase of 50 basis points to the floor compared to our previous guide range of 10.0% to 13.0%. We are maintaining our adjusted EBITDAC margin guidance of between 29.0% and 30.0%. As we noted on our prior calls, we expect the headwinds affecting organic revenue growth will persist through at least the second quarter of this year. In summary, we were pleased with our first quarter performance, and we remain very excited about our near-term and long-term prospects. With that, we thank you for your time, and we\u2019d like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question is just given the fact that once we get to the second quarter, there\u2019s a greater concentration of property business, and I know you guys still said that you will have some of these headwinds persisting, but wouldn\u2019t that more than offset that, i.e., like the first quarter could conceptually be the lowest organic quarter of the year if you get more property in the business mix and the headwinds start to go away?\nJeremiah Bickham: Elyse, thank you. Yes, from an information perspective, especially on the property side, Q2 will be a lot more telling. There\u2019s more property business in Q2, and it\u2019s also just a bigger quarter from a seasonality perspective.\nElyse Greenspan: And then \u2013 but am I wrong? Does it feel like the impact of the headwinds keeps getting lower, right, meaning you probably felt it a little bit less in the Q1 than the Q4 and then the same could apply to the Q2 and the other quarters of the year?\nJeremiah Bickham: There\u2019s a number of headwinds that are still in play, Elyse, and I suspect we may get into them in a little bit more detail later in the call. But the headwinds related to public company D&O, given that we\u2019ll have, hopefully, lapped the hardest part of our book by Q2, we do expect some relief there. We\u2019re not calling for a relief in the overall market. But as it relates to our book, it should get easier. The macroeconomic related headwinds, who\u2019s to say. But as you can see from the pretty strong results here in Q1, our teams are really resilient and innovative and have found ways to win and create new opportunities. So we\u2019re \u2013 we feel good about the Q1 results. We feel good about the rest of the year. But Q1 is our smallest quarter from a seasonality perspective. So there\u2019s not too much information that you can glean from it.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then one last one. You guys seem to speak positively about the M&A environment. Pat, just hoping to get a little bit more color just on what you\u2019re seeing out there and things that Ryan is looking at these days.\nPat Ryan: Sure. Thanks, Elyse. As I said in my comments and Jeremiah just repeated, the M&A pipeline is very strong. We\u2019re actually calling it a robust pipeline, as we said. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we\u2019re not a roll-up. We\u2019re not an investor in companies. We buy, we integrate and we make companies \u2013 good companies better and really good companies great. And so I think it\u2019s really important to keep that in mind. When we do acquisitions, we\u2019re looking to expand the scope. Scope could be geographies. Scope could be additional lines of business. Everything we do is strategic. We\u2019re not doing opportunistic. We\u2019re not doing acquisitions just for scale. But when we expand for scope, we get scale. So for example, we closed Griffin in the Pacific Northwest earlier in the year, and we\u2019re very pleased on how they already are assimilated in advancing our binding authority strategy and our brokerage strategy. So those acquisitions, we look at and we bring them in and already we\u2019re getting improvement in performance. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, today\u2019s acquisitions are tomorrow\u2019s organic growth, and we\u2019re seeing that from prior acquisitions. The productivity improvements are really quite high. We\u2019ve been holding some very serious discussions. We\u2019re optimistic about these discussions and the stage where we currently exist. We\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll be able to communicate positive results in the weeks and months ahead. We\u2019re very excited about the strategic objectives that these deals would bring us. And we want to stay disciplined. We\u2019ve said that, and we repeat it. And we\u2019re only going to do an M&A transaction when it meets all three of our criteria: cultural fit, strategic and accretive. The discussions we\u2019re holding that could emerge in the next weeks, months fit all those criteria. So I think we\u2019re being consistent and disciplined, but we\u2019re quite optimistic.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nWeston Bloomer: Hi, good afternoon. So my first question, just on the full year organic guidance does imply a slowdown versus the 1Q results. And if property is accelerating and it seems \u2013 you seem to say that other headwinds are abating, I guess, what else are we missing in the stronger results? Or where else could we see a slowdown? Like were client wins or submissions just ahead of your initial expectations? It just feels like the property more than offset the other headwinds you guys have been referencing.\nJeremiah Bickham: Hi, Weston. It\u2019s Jeremiah. So the reason we ticked up the floor of guidance \u2013 well, part of the reason obviously \u2013 we\u2019ve got one solid quarter in the books. But we thought it was prudent to reiterate the 10% \u2013 the implied 10% to 13% outlook that we started the year with. And just as a reminder, we kicked off the annual guidance for 2023 with a 300 basis points range for organic revenue growth because we all thought it was prudent to acknowledge there\u2019s a healthy degree of variability and uncertainty mostly in macroeconomic conditions. But since we last spoke, those factors really haven\u2019t improved, and a lot of people would tell you they\u2019ve gotten worse. Our business, though, is in quite good shape when you look at renewals, submissions, new business, which, of course, we do. Those indicators, all very, very healthy. But as I said to Elyse a moment ago, it\u2019s still very early in the year, and there\u2019s not much new information since we last spoke. And while Q1 was solid, it\u2019s still our smallest quarter. So we\u2019ve factored all that in as we raised the floor and have basically just reiterated the 10% to 13% range that we started with. Q2, off to a good start. And in spite of all the macro uncertainty that still exists in the economy that all companies are facing, we\u2019re really confident in our ability to deliver on this guide range.\nWeston Bloomer: Thanks. And could you expand on the macro backdrop that\u2019s implied within the guidance range, either from like a GDP or inflationary perspective?\nJeremiah Bickham: Well, just a couple of examples. The IPO market, or lack thereof, has an impact on a public D&O. Pricing, that is a headwind for everyone in the space. Global economic conditions, including rising interest rates, are affecting M&A volume, which globally is down 20% to 40% depending on who you\u2019re reading.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. And you referenced in the prepared remarks the build-out of the employee benefits practice. Can you just give an update on where you are there and some of the initiatives you\u2019re taking to grow that?\nPat Ryan: Yes. Sure. We\u2019re quite optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to announce activity relatively soon \u2013 I mean, completion of that. We\u2019ve talked about a lot of activity. But they\u2019re in that area that I talked about, having serious discussions. We\u2019ve spent a good amount of time defining the exact role that we should be playing, and we\u2019re very optimistic that where we\u2019re going to be playing has significant organic growth potential and should have quite good margins. That\u2019s about all we want to say about that at this point.\nWeston Bloomer: Thank you. Appreciate the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Thank you. Just a follow-up. You mentioned that the headwinds related to public company D&O should improve by the second quarter. Is that because you\u2019ve already seen reverse flow to the mid-end market, so you already contemplated that when you developed your organic revenue guide?\nJeremiah Bickham: Correct. We were not predicting a change in the overall D&O market. We just think to the extent that there was business in our book that could be placed directly, that after a full lap, we\u2019ll be through most of that.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Great. And in your updated guide, you reiterated your EBITDA margins, that you\u2019re tracking behind that. I get there is some seasonality factors. But what are the key drivers you\u2019re contemplating to achieve this guide?\nJeremiah Bickham: Well, as a reminder, we would, in most years, expect Q1 and Q3 to be lower \u2013 smaller from a size perspective in terms of revenue and then lower from a margin perspective and often below the annual rate that we expect and sort of the inverse for Q2 and Q4. And appreciate that it\u2019s difficult to model these on a quarterly basis. Particularly, last year, we did quite a bit of hiring and T&E was still ramping up. But actually, Tracy, the relationship of our margin and our revenue growth for this quarter was very much in line with our expectations and actually make us that much more confident in the guide range that we\u2019re reiterating today. And as we said just two months ago on the year-end call, again, uncertainty and variability that we felt it was prudent to reflect in not only the organic growth guide range, but the margin guide range. And since Q1 is the smallest seasonally, it\u2019s really not prudent to deviate from that at this time.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nRob Cox: Hey. Maybe a specific question to kind of the large state of California. The premium growth there has been \u2013 it\u2019s been negative, and I think it\u2019s been a drag, especially relative to some of the southeastern states. Just curious what\u2019s driving that and when you think that could potentially turn around.\nTim Turner: Well, our position in the southwest and California, in particular, has been driven by wildfire exposures to a high degree, creating a lot of opportunities for us and high net worth construction, habitational, transportation. It\u2019s a big position for us in California. So the market share for us in California, I believe, we\u2019re an industry leader on surplus lines tax in California. So we\u2019re very bullish on the volume of business being dumped into the E&S channel.\nRob Cox: Got it. That\u2019s great. And maybe just with respect to the margins, I think this is the most difficult comp with regards to T&E for the year. So I was wondering if you guys could quantify the T&E headwind in the quarter and maybe just to comment on how you expect margins to sort of progress over the remainder of the year.\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. So you are absolutely right. T&E is going to have the most \u2013 it\u2019s going to be the worst comp for T&E in Q1. There\u2019s still some ramp-up that will flow through for Q2, just the same issue with the hiring that we did, too. There\u2019s a ramp-up that\u2019s going to affect the comparable margins in Q2. It definitely does get better as the year goes on just because the hiring will be represented in more of the quarters. And by the end of the year, T&E was a lot closer to what we expect on an annual rate this year. So it does improve. And like I said, with the margins that came in this quarter, we\u2019re very confident in the range that we\u2019re reiterating today.\nRob Cox: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nRyan Tunis: Sorry, I was muted. Good evening guys. First question, I guess, when we last spoke, it seemed like you guys thought that the 1Q organic \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It sounded like it might be running lower than the full year guide in the first or maybe in the second quarter. What better than your expectations that got to the nearly 13% this quarter?\nPat Ryan: Well, I think what we really guided to was that the property market was growing nicely in the fourth quarter and that we expected that to continue and it has.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then I guess we\u2019re not really quantifying these headwinds specifically. But if you had to take a guess like between the macro side of things and the D&O side of things, those seem to be kind of the biggest driver, what percentage of it is kind of macro related and what percentage of it is D&O related?\nJeremiah Bickham: Well, there\u2019s overlap between macro, Ryan, and D&O because we at least believe that the macroeconomic environment is affecting the amount of IPOs, which has an impact on the overall D&O market, which affects pricing. So there\u2019s overlap there. You could maybe break it down to macroeconomic headwinds that affect everyone and then things that are more specific to our book or our business mix. But we haven\u2019t and won\u2019t try to break that out or reconcile it here. I think what you can take away, though, is that the net of all of that, all the headwinds in D&O, M&A volume, parts of our construction book, all very much alive and well, but the teams are finding other ways to win and fight through it. And if our prediction, our hope, that the worst of our \u2013 one of our bigger headwinds public company D&O is past us by the end of Q2, it does set us up for a very strong H2 of this year.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then just lastly, I guess, on these headwinds. Tim mentioned that there are also some admitted carriers pulling business back a little bit, cyber becoming a little bit of a tougher market, too. Like just, I guess, to me, it sounds like the normal type of way the business responds at the end of a hard market when things become more rate adequate. So I guess my question is why would you think that these headwinds wouldn\u2019t continue to become bigger headwinds as the year goes on? What makes you think that they\u2019re actually going to mitigate when we get in the back half of the year?\nTim Turner: Well, those headwinds that we mentioned are outliers. They\u2019re very narrow lines of business that public D&O, you could see the impact of the business going back into the standard market. Cyber is really rate declines and a little bit of movement on the business. Construction is even more narrow. It\u2019s residential construction, frame construction. And there\u2019s just a slight slowdown that we think is related to interest rates. The overall market is very strong. And the flow of E&S business into our channel in the first quarter was up double digits. So it continues to expand. It continues to grow, and we see a very firm market all the way through 2023 and even beyond that. So there\u2019s no letup whatsoever.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. Mike, could you check if you're on mute please?\nMike Ward: Hey, sorry guys. Sorry guys. I was just wondering if you could go over cash flows and wondering if there are any onetime items in the quarter?\nJeremiah Bickham: No. No. No onetime items. Some of the bigger, unusual lumpy items that were flowing through operating cash flows were what we basically think of as earnouts paid to people and that have to run through comp and then flow through operating versus investing cash flows like an acquisition would. We did put out a nine-figure cash outlay for an acquisition in Q1. And then we have a huge seasonal working capital draw in Q1 because we accrue bonuses for our producers and sort of true them up twice a year, and the biggest true-up is in Q1. So we relieve a lot of accrued comp expense that you\u2019ll see every year on the balance sheet at 12/31 in Q1. So it\u2019s a net negative operating cash flow because of that.\nMike Ward: Great. Thank you. And then maybe just broadly, I think you talked about strength in transportation practice. So we\u2019re hoping for a little bit more color on how that\u2019s performing in terms of rate and flow.\nTim Turner: Transportation market remains very, very firm. It\u2019s a loss leader in the reinsurance world. Our investment in Crouse and Associates on the West Coast has started to pay some very nice dividends. We\u2019re in every aspect of transportation, whether it be long-haul trucking, delivery, shared economy. We have transportation units in several of our offices across the country, and that continues to do a lot of damage in the reinsurance world. And we look for transportation as a whole to continue to get more difficult and firmer in the quarters ahead.\nMike Ward: Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next questions come from the line of Derek Han with KBW. Please proceed with your questions.\nDerek Han: Hi, thank you. So I think, Tim, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the healthy submission flows in transportation, health care and other markets as well as real estate, which I think is new. Can you just talk about what\u2019s going on in real estate and what your outlook is if the macro worsens?\nTim Turner: Sure. Habitational on the casualty side of the house is one of the hardest parts of the casualty market. It\u2019s, again, a loss leader in the reinsurance world. It\u2019s done a lot of damage to the balance sheets of standard markets, and the rates continue to go up even in the E&S sector as we renew these accounts. Social inflation, the economic impact, loss cost factors having a huge impact on the deterioration of losses on these large accounts. But it spans through a very wide class of business. Apartments, any type of habitational group of risks that come into the market are getting rate \u2013 significant rate increases. So I would say that\u2019s probably one of the hardest parts of the casualty market today with no letup in sight. And again, on the property side, it can be equally as difficult. So we see that class of business come in on both cylinders.\nDerek Han: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then my second question is on just a competitor called that slower organic in their wholesale segment due to capacity constraints. We didn\u2019t really see that in your numbers at all. Your organic was very strong. Are you seeing any capacity constraints? And maybe what makes you kind of different from other peers?\nTim Turner: Well, there is a capacity constraint. But it\u2019s, again, in a very narrow class of business. And it\u2019s high net worth. It\u2019s personal lines. There\u2019s a wind and flood capacity shortage. And so we\u2019re doing very well despite that. We\u2019re attracting more aggregate and more wind capacity, but it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s a loss leader in the standard markets, and we\u2019re rolling up our sleeves and bringing in as much of that wind aggregate as we can. But it\u2019s tough out there.\nDerek Han: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call back over to Pat Ryan for any closing remarks.\nPat Ryan: Well, thank you very much for your support and for your interest and good questions. We\u2019re very optimistic, as you can tell. We feel our company is strong going \u2013 things are going quite well. So listen, we\u2019ll be meeting some of you at meetings, but we look forward to the next quarterly report. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Jeremiah Bickham",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. In Q1, we grew total revenue 18.3% period-over-period to $458 million fueled by another strong quarter of organic revenue growth at 12.9% as we continue to see the benefit of ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market, broad-based strength in many of our lines including property and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business. Net income for Q1 2023 was $36 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $72 million or $0.26 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAC for the first quarter grew 16.5% period-over-period to $125 million, while adjusted EBITDAC margin declined 40 basis points to 27.3%. Our EBITDAC margin was impacted by continued investments in our business and T&E continuing to return to normalized levels, both of which were partially offset by higher fiduciary investment income. Regarding our adjusted EBITDAC margin, on a seasonal basis, the second and fourth quarters are historically our largest quarters in terms of revenue and therefore the strongest in terms of margin, while the first and third quarters are typically smaller and lower from a margin perspective. Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program. We had a small charge in the quarter, and we expect charges to ramp up in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024. As a result, very little P&L savings will materialize this year. Savings will gradually increase as 2024 progresses, and we remain on track to generate annual savings of $35 million in 2025. We made significant progress in the first quarter in onboarding additional underwriting and broking talent, and we expect that our recruitment efforts will continue as we progress throughout the year. Cost of these investments, along with the annualization of our 2022 headcount growth, will be partially offset by increases in fiduciary investment income during 2023. As Pat said, these investments in talent, particularly in the recruitment of new colleagues, offer the highest return for our shareholders and are part of a proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. We are now guiding organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2023 to be between 10.5% and 13.0%, which reflects an increase of 50 basis points to the floor compared to our previous guide range of 10.0% to 13.0%. We are maintaining our adjusted EBITDAC margin guidance of between 29.0% and 30.0%. As we noted on our prior calls, we expect the headwinds affecting organic revenue growth will persist through at least the second quarter of this year. In summary, we were pleased with our first quarter performance, and we remain very excited about our near-term and long-term prospects. With that, we thank you for your time, and we'd like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Elyse, thank you. Yes, from an information perspective, especially on the property side, Q2 will be a lot more telling. There's more property business in Q2, and it's also just a bigger quarter from a seasonality perspective. There's a number of headwinds that are still in play, Elyse, and I suspect we may get into them in a little bit more detail later in the call. But the headwinds related to public company D&O, given that we'll have, hopefully, lapped the hardest part of our book by Q2, we do expect some relief there. We're not calling for a relief in the overall market. But as it relates to our book, it should get easier. The macroeconomic related headwinds, who's to say. But as you can see from the pretty strong results here in Q1, our teams are really resilient and innovative and have found ways to win and create new opportunities. So we're \u2013 we feel good about the Q1 results. We feel good about the rest of the year. But Q1 is our smallest quarter from a seasonality perspective. So there's not too much information that you can glean from it. Hi, Weston. It's Jeremiah. So the reason we ticked up the floor of guidance \u2013 well, part of the reason obviously \u2013 we've got one solid quarter in the books. But we thought it was prudent to reiterate the 10% \u2013 the implied 10% to 13% outlook that we started the year with. And just as a reminder, we kicked off the annual guidance for 2023 with a 300 basis points range for organic revenue growth because we all thought it was prudent to acknowledge there's a healthy degree of variability and uncertainty mostly in macroeconomic conditions. But since we last spoke, those factors really haven't improved, and a lot of people would tell you they've gotten worse. Our business, though, is in quite good shape when you look at renewals, submissions, new business, which, of course, we do. Those indicators, all very, very healthy. But as I said to Elyse a moment ago, it's still very early in the year, and there's not much new information since we last spoke. And while Q1 was solid, it's still our smallest quarter. So we've factored all that in as we raised the floor and have basically just reiterated the 10% to 13% range that we started with. Q2, off to a good start. And in spite of all the macro uncertainty that still exists in the economy that all companies are facing, we're really confident in our ability to deliver on this guide range. Well, just a couple of examples. The IPO market, or lack thereof, has an impact on a public D&O. Pricing, that is a headwind for everyone in the space. Global economic conditions, including rising interest rates, are affecting M&A volume, which globally is down 20% to 40% depending on who you're reading. Correct. We were not predicting a change in the overall D&O market. We just think to the extent that there was business in our book that could be placed directly, that after a full lap, we'll be through most of that. Well, as a reminder, we would, in most years, expect Q1 and Q3 to be lower \u2013 smaller from a size perspective in terms of revenue and then lower from a margin perspective and often below the annual rate that we expect and sort of the inverse for Q2 and Q4. And appreciate that it's difficult to model these on a quarterly basis. Particularly, last year, we did quite a bit of hiring and T&E was still ramping up. But actually, Tracy, the relationship of our margin and our revenue growth for this quarter was very much in line with our expectations and actually make us that much more confident in the guide range that we're reiterating today. And as we said just two months ago on the year-end call, again, uncertainty and variability that we felt it was prudent to reflect in not only the organic growth guide range, but the margin guide range. And since Q1 is the smallest seasonally, it's really not prudent to deviate from that at this time. Yes. So you are absolutely right. T&E is going to have the most \u2013 it's going to be the worst comp for T&E in Q1. There's still some ramp-up that will flow through for Q2, just the same issue with the hiring that we did, too. There's a ramp-up that's going to affect the comparable margins in Q2. It definitely does get better as the year goes on just because the hiring will be represented in more of the quarters. And by the end of the year, T&E was a lot closer to what we expect on an annual rate this year. So it does improve. And like I said, with the margins that came in this quarter, we're very confident in the range that we're reiterating today. Well, there's overlap between macro, Ryan, and D&O because we at least believe that the macroeconomic environment is affecting the amount of IPOs, which has an impact on the overall D&O market, which affects pricing. So there's overlap there. You could maybe break it down to macroeconomic headwinds that affect everyone and then things that are more specific to our book or our business mix. But we haven't and won't try to break that out or reconcile it here. I think what you can take away, though, is that the net of all of that, all the headwinds in D&O, M&A volume, parts of our construction book, all very much alive and well, but the teams are finding other ways to win and fight through it. And if our prediction, our hope, that the worst of our \u2013 one of our bigger headwinds public company D&O is past us by the end of Q2, it does set us up for a very strong H2 of this year. No. No. No onetime items. Some of the bigger, unusual lumpy items that were flowing through operating cash flows were what we basically think of as earnouts paid to people and that have to run through comp and then flow through operating versus investing cash flows like an acquisition would. We did put out a nine-figure cash outlay for an acquisition in Q1. And then we have a huge seasonal working capital draw in Q1 because we accrue bonuses for our producers and sort of true them up twice a year, and the biggest true-up is in Q1. So we relieve a lot of accrued comp expense that you'll see every year on the balance sheet at 12/31 in Q1. So it's a net negative operating cash flow because of that."

            "name": "Pat Ryan",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. With me on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller; along with Noah Angeletti and Nick Mezick from Investor Relations. First quarter represents a great start to the year. We grew total revenue 18.3% led by organic growth of 12.9%, building on 20.1% organic growth in the first quarter of 2022. We also achieved double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDAC and adjusted net income on a year-over-year basis. In the first quarter, we saw a broad-based strength in many lines of business, including continued growth in property. The specific headwinds we noted on our prior calls were in line with our expectations and offset some of our property tailwinds. We anticipate that these headwinds will persist into at least the second quarter. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the volatile macroeconomic environment. Despite headlines in the banking sector, persistent inflation and heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe our firm will continue to perform well through this economic cycle. Our products are largely compulsory. And as risks become ever more complex, we are uniquely positioned to provide our clients with the experience, expertise and innovation they require to seamlessly manage their insurance needs. Growth in the E&S marketplace continues to outpace the overall P&C insurance market and is providing solutions that would not otherwise be attainable or hard-to-place risks. Given today's macroeconomic and broader insurance challenges, the E&S market is resilient, nimble and offers Ryan Specialty a tremendous opportunity for growth. Specific to Ryan Specialty, our specialized and industry-leading broker teams navigated the complexities of the market, including each of the micro cycles within the hundreds of lines that comprise commercial insurance, providing solutions that are uniquely tailored to our clients' needs. Our delegated authority specialties and binding and underwriting management continue to generate underwriting profit on behalf of our trading partners and delivered strong top line growth. The widespread marketing exercises and strong relationships with our carrier trading partners, our experts find coverage for hard-to-place risks by crafting and weaving together large towers of capacity for our clients. This is particularly valued by our clients and insurers in a challenging insurance market. We have also expanded our ability to serve brokers, agents and carriers through innovation and the creation of alternatives to traditional insurance placements. This is especially meaningful in areas like CAT property and transportation. We continue to serve our clients and trading partners with distinction thanks to the exceptional team we've assembled since our founding, and we take great pride in developing the next generation of teammates and leaders. We continue to make targeted investments during the quarter, adding underwriters and brokers to further deepen our current capabilities and develop areas we anticipate our clients will need in the future. To that end, we seamlessly picked up from where we left off in 2022 when we onboarded the largest production class in our history. These investments, particularly in the recruitment of new colleagues, offer the greatest returns for our shareholders and are part of our proven winning formula to maintain our long-term growth prospects. On the M&A front, our pipeline remains robust, including opportunities that would bring foundational capabilities and wholesale employee benefits. As a reminder, we closed the highly strategic acquisition, Griffin Underwriting Services, at the beginning of the year, and it is contributing to both our binding authority and brokerage specialties. We remain disciplined in our pursuit of acquisitions, particularly in the current environment, as we will only move forward when all of our criteria are met. Every acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive as is evident by our consistently strong performance. We do not require acquisitions to achieve our growth targets in any given period. Looking ahead, I remain confident that 2023 will be another strong year for our firm. We are well positioned to capture the broader E&S tailwinds while capitalizing on our specific areas of accelerated growth. Our flexible business model continues to enable us to quickly adapt and pivot to ever-changing market conditions. I'm proud of our entire team for staying focused and delivering outstanding results for our clients, trading partners and shareholders. Our differentiated business model continues to stand apart from the competition and sets us up to continue delivering significant value for years to come. Now I'm pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim? Sure. Thanks, Elyse. As I said in my comments and Jeremiah just repeated, the M&A pipeline is very strong. We're actually calling it a robust pipeline, as we said. I'd like to remind everyone that we're not a roll-up. We're not an investor in companies. We buy, we integrate and we make companies \u2013 good companies better and really good companies great. And so I think it's really important to keep that in mind. When we do acquisitions, we're looking to expand the scope. Scope could be geographies. Scope could be additional lines of business. Everything we do is strategic. We're not doing opportunistic. We're not doing acquisitions just for scale. But when we expand for scope, we get scale. So for example, we closed Griffin in the Pacific Northwest earlier in the year, and we're very pleased on how they already are assimilated in advancing our binding authority strategy and our brokerage strategy. So those acquisitions, we look at and we bring them in and already we're getting improvement in performance. And as we've said in the past, today's acquisitions are tomorrow's organic growth, and we're seeing that from prior acquisitions. The productivity improvements are really quite high. We've been holding some very serious discussions. We're optimistic about these discussions and the stage where we currently exist. We're hopeful we'll be able to communicate positive results in the weeks and months ahead. We're very excited about the strategic objectives that these deals would bring us. And we want to stay disciplined. We've said that, and we repeat it. And we're only going to do an M&A transaction when it meets all three of our criteria: cultural fit, strategic and accretive. The discussions we're holding that could emerge in the next weeks, months fit all those criteria. So I think we're being consistent and disciplined, but we're quite optimistic. Yes. Sure. We're quite optimistic that we'll be able to announce activity relatively soon \u2013 I mean, completion of that. We've talked about a lot of activity. But they're in that area that I talked about, having serious discussions. We've spent a good amount of time defining the exact role that we should be playing, and we're very optimistic that where we're going to be playing has significant organic growth potential and should have quite good margins. That's about all we want to say about that at this point. Well, I think what we really guided to was that the property market was growing nicely in the fourth quarter and that we expected that to continue and it has. Well, thank you very much for your support and for your interest and good questions. We're very optimistic, as you can tell. We feel our company is strong going \u2013 things are going quite well. So listen, we'll be meeting some of you at meetings, but we look forward to the next quarterly report. Thank you."

            "name": "Tim Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. We had a strong start to 2023 across our specialties, and our entire team remains determined to maintain that momentum throughout the year. Ongoing industry trends, such as social inflation, climate change and older mass tort claims, combined with economic inflation are driving more risks into the E&S marketplace, which offers significantly more freedom of rate and form. We remain well positioned to continue successfully executing our playbook. Diving into our specialties. Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty achieved another quarter of strong growth, balanced across most lines of business. In property, we are seeing multiple forces at play, including recent year's elevated loss activity for both attritional and secondary perils, inflation driving higher costs of materials and labor, higher reinsurance pricing and diminished capital levels. This has led to a historically hard market, which continued into April with significant rate increases. We expect the hard property market to continue as the effects of reinsurers derisking their portfolios at January 1 and April 1 reinsurance renewals are felt and as insurers approach a continued challenging renewal at 6/1 and 7/1. These factors are driving the flow of new business into the non-admitted market, and our industry-leading team of experts allow us to fill that need with innovative insurance solutions. We believe property will continue to be a strong driver of growth in 2023. Our transportation practice had another strong quarter and continues to see substantial flow fueled by social inflation and carrier need for continued rate increases. We continue to win our fair share of business and remain well positioned to capitalize on additional growth opportunities. In our casualty practice, we are seeing higher loss trends, inflation and reserving issues that are driving more flow into the E&S channel, particularly in lines like health care, sports and entertainment, higher education, habitational and real estate. Regarding the recent events in the banking sector, to date, we have seen only a modest impact on D&O focused on the banking sector. While losses may end up being material to the market, at this time, we do not see a systemic risk for D&O insurers or any signs the market is materially hardening. However, there remains some uncertainty about further banking failures, and we are closely monitoring the market as the risks evolve. But especially in times of uncertainty, our producers add value and deliver the best solutions to our clients. We believe Wholesale Brokerage is well positioned to grow consistently in the coming months and years. In our Binding Authority specialty, we saw another quarter of solid growth in traditional binding, which includes smaller commercial businesses somewhat limited by capacity constraints in personal lines. We continue to see further potential for panel consolidation as a long and steady growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to execute. Our Underwriting Management specialty continued to post strong results led by steady and profitable growth in property and casualty and our reinsurance MGU, Ryan Re. As Pat noted, the specific headwinds in certain lines in the first quarter were in line with our expectations. Specifically, we saw a rapid rate decline in public company D&O, lower external M&A and IPO volumes and transactional liability and delayed project-based starts and construction. Pricing in the E&S market largely held firm or is accelerating in many lines of business with property continuing to see the most rate momentum. Exceptions are public company D&O where we saw further rate pressure and cyber, which is now seeing modest rate declines. As with all cycles, as pricing continues to increase and certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy, we see admitted markets step back in on certain placements, particularly within large towers. But overall, the standard market carrier competition has yet to meaningfully impact rate or flow in the aggregate. As we frequently noted, we expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to continue to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our first quarter. Thank you. Well, our position in the southwest and California, in particular, has been driven by wildfire exposures to a high degree, creating a lot of opportunities for us and high net worth construction, habitational, transportation. It's a big position for us in California. So the market share for us in California, I believe, we're an industry leader on surplus lines tax in California. So we're very bullish on the volume of business being dumped into the E&S channel. Well, those headwinds that we mentioned are outliers. They're very narrow lines of business that public D&O, you could see the impact of the business going back into the standard market. Cyber is really rate declines and a little bit of movement on the business. Construction is even more narrow. It's residential construction, frame construction. And there's just a slight slowdown that we think is related to interest rates. The overall market is very strong. And the flow of E&S business into our channel in the first quarter was up double digits. So it continues to expand. It continues to grow, and we see a very firm market all the way through 2023 and even beyond that. So there's no letup whatsoever. Transportation market remains very, very firm. It's a loss leader in the reinsurance world. Our investment in Crouse and Associates on the West Coast has started to pay some very nice dividends. We're in every aspect of transportation, whether it be long-haul trucking, delivery, shared economy. We have transportation units in several of our offices across the country, and that continues to do a lot of damage in the reinsurance world. And we look for transportation as a whole to continue to get more difficult and firmer in the quarters ahead. Sure. Habitational on the casualty side of the house is one of the hardest parts of the casualty market. It's, again, a loss leader in the reinsurance world. It's done a lot of damage to the balance sheets of standard markets, and the rates continue to go up even in the E&S sector as we renew these accounts. Social inflation, the economic impact, loss cost factors having a huge impact on the deterioration of losses on these large accounts. But it spans through a very wide class of business. Apartments, any type of habitational group of risks that come into the market are getting rate \u2013 significant rate increases. So I would say that's probably one of the hardest parts of the casualty market today with no letup in sight. And again, on the property side, it can be equally as difficult. So we see that class of business come in on both cylinders. Well, there is a capacity constraint. But it's, again, in a very narrow class of business. And it's high net worth. It's personal lines. There's a wind and flood capacity shortage. And so we're doing very well despite that. We're attracting more aggregate and more wind capacity, but it's tough. It's a loss leader in the standard markets, and we're rolling up our sleeves and bringing in as much of that wind aggregate as we can. But it's tough out there."

In addition to this call, the company filed a press release with the SEC earlier this afternoon, which has also been posted to its website at ryanspecialty.com. On today's call, management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Listeners are encouraged to review the more detailed discussion -- the more detailed discussion of these risk factors contained in the company's filings with the SEC. The company assumes no duty to update such forward-looking statements in the future, except as required by law. Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financials measures to the most closely comparable measures prepared in accordance GAAP are included in the earnings release, which is filed with the SEC and available on the company's website. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Founder and Executive Chairman of Product Specialty. Pat Ryan.\nPat Ryan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results. With me on today's call is our CEO, Tim Turner; our President, Jeremiah Bickham; our CFO, Janice Hamilton; our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller; and our Director of Investor Relations, Nick Mezick. We delivered an excellent third quarter by all measures. We grew total revenue 20.5%, which includes strong organic revenue growth of 11.8% and meaningful contributions from M&A. I'd like to pause for a moment to express how proud I am of these accomplishments this quarter, most specifically our organic growth. Our organic growth in Q3 of last year was 15% and was buttressed by a surge of growth in property. So that's quite a comp in which to compound. In contrast, this past quarter, we faced what we believe to be short-term headwinds as property rate deterioration accelerated in September prior to hurricanes Helene and Milton. We're taking market share of both new risks and renewals in the E&S market, we overcame these headwinds and posted very healthy growth in property and in our overall portfolio. All in all, 20.5% total growth and 11.8% organic growth for the quarter under these circumstances is further proof of Ryan Specialty's resilience and growth engine. We grew adjusted EBITDAC 29.4% to $190 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 220 basis points to 31.5% and adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% to $0.41 per share. We also had a very active quarter for acquisitions, which aligns with our disciplined long-term M&A strategy. We target high-quality businesses with differentiated talent, which provides us with more capabilities to meet our clients' evolving and growing needs. We're very excited about the talent and tools we added to Ryan Specialty in Q3, which Tim will discuss shortly. Further, our leadership succession plan was executed seamlessly on October 1. I'm very proud to have Tim sitting next to me today as Ryan Specialty's new CEO. I'm confident that we have the right team in place to continue executing our winning strategy today and over the long term. Ryan Specialty is stronger than ever, and our teammates are excited for the future. We believe that we will continue to deliver innovative solutions to our clients, generate industry-leading organic growth, execute our M&A strategy, continue to increase profitability and create additional value for our shareholders. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Tim. Tim?\nTim Turner : Thank you very much, Pat. I'm honored to take the baton from Pat and speak with everyone today as Ryan Specialty's CEO. For nearly 15 years, I've dedicated myself to the success of this firm and our teammates, and I couldn't be prouder of what this team has achieved thus far. In many ways, we have already accomplished more than we imagined in 2010 when Pat and I were just getting started. What has me so energized and so motivated right now, though, is my belief that we have the opportunity to dwarf our accomplishments to date. As Pat said a moment ago, we are stronger than ever and have growth opportunities now that did not exist for us previously. Our conviction to put our clients first, our focus on specialized expertise, our commitment to rewarding top talent and our dedication to excellence in everything we do is being validated by the market every day. Our exceptional growth, our success at recruiting and our unique M&A opportunities are all a reflection of that. Rather than being satisfied with our accomplishments thus far, we are doubling down on our strategy and putting everything we have into capitalizing on the opportunities in front of us. Our goal is not just to continue our momentum but to accelerate it. As we pull ahead of the competition, we're charging harder than ever. We have more firepower, more passion and a better story to tell than we've ever had before. I couldn't be more excited. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to set the stage with three important points. After that, I will walk through our performance by specialty, observations on industry trends, progress on our M&A strategy and investments that we're making in the business. The first point I would like to make is on independence. We are very serious about putting our clients first and a key element of independence is that we don't compete with the retail brokers and agents we aim to serve. With each passing day, the value of independence is becoming more and more of an obvious truth. However, this has been a cornerstone of our strategy and the North Star of our client-first philosophy since our founding. We believe this commitment to our clients has been a crucial part of our success and will be going forward. The second point I would like to make is on the durable value proposition of delegated underwriting authority. This is a principle that our firm was founded on and it's one that's gained significant traction in recent years. It is our closely held belief that delegated authority is not only here to stay but will continue gaining momentum as the value proposition is self-evident. However, the long-term success of the model is dependent on intermediaries like Ryan Specialty, who manage delegated authority with the highest professional standards. We honor our fiduciary responsibility to our capital providers and have demonstrated to them that we're not interested in growth at any cost. Their profitability has to come first. Doing this the right way requires not only that commitment, but the ongoing investment in talent, technology and governance to make sure that commitment is honored. This is an area that sets us apart and one we will continue to leverage to deepen our penetration in the delegated authority space. The third and final point I'll make before getting to the results is on panel consolidation. There is a growing recognition among retail brokers of the need to optimize client outcomes, minimize E&Os and invest in long-term strategic relationships that help them win. As the world continues to get riskier and more complex, we believe that deep industry specialization and a focus on fast, consistent execution is the only way to earn and keep business in our industry, and we stand ready to deliver that to our clients every single day. Now on to the results. As Pat noted, it was another exceptional quarter for Ryan Specialty. We executed well across our strategic, financial and operational objectives. We had broad-based growth across our specialties, meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions and delivered strong underwriting profit for our carrier trading partners. Diving into our specialties, our wholesale brokerage specialty generated another quarter of strong growth. Our property practice had another impressive quarter of growth. We overcame what we believe to be short-term headwinds as property pricing deteriorated throughout the quarter and prior to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We also overcame a tough comparable in a market that was seeing strong pricing increases in the prior year. We overcame these trends as we generated excellent new business, took share of strong flow into the channel and won head-to-head against our competitors and had high retention. Prior to this year's hurricane season, we continue to see expanded catastrophe appetite as additional capacity entered the market. Recently, the market has been working through the impact of two devastating hurricanes and a record year of severe convective storms. It is still too early to know for sure how the insurance and reinsurance markets will react, but many industry sources are pointing to renewals being flat to up by 1/1. We can deliver significant value to our clients in any market cycle through our deep specialty and industry capabilities and ability to navigate this dynamic environment. Property will be an important contributor to our growth moving forward and a very strong part of our portfolio over the long term. Our casualty practice had another excellent quarter. A challenging loss environment is driving higher loss costs in numerous casualty classes. This is partly driven by social inflation, marked by increased frequency and more prolonged cases, higher settlements, judgments and nuclear verdicts and amplified by litigation finance and partly by reserve charges related to the 2015 through 2019 accident years and the recognition of reserve inadequacy for more recent years. The market is reacting to these trends by raising prices, focusing on limit management and moving risks into the specialty and E&S market. As a result, the need for our specialized industry and product level knowledge has never been greater and our value proposition to our clients has never been stronger. We remain confident that casualty will be a strong driver of our growth moving forward and that we will continue to be a leader in casualty solutions for years to come. Now turning to our delegated authority specialties, which include both binding and underwriting management. Our binding authority specialty continues to perform very well, driven by our top-tier talent and expanding product set for small, tough-to-place commercial P&C risks. We continue to believe panel consolidation in binding authority and programs remains a long-term growth opportunity and we are well positioned to capitalize. Our underwriting management specialty had another outstanding quarter, particularly in M&A transactional liability, health care and property and casualty. Growth was aided by meaningful contributions from recent acquisitions and contingent commissions as we delivered strong underwriting profit for our carrier trading partners. Stepping back, our delegated authority specialties remains very well positioned to execute on both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We are confident in our talent, our platform and our ability to remain a destination of choice for high-quality MGUs and their specialized talent. We believe this combination, paired with our skill to manage the business through the insurance cycle ensures our ability to deliver consistently profitable underwriting results, growth and scale over the long term. Our success and track record of excellent underwriting results have accelerated our speed to market, developed broader and deeper relationships across our carrier trading partners and onboarded additional capacity. Turning to price. After years of significant pricing increases, including in the prior year's quarter, property pricing was down in Q3 with a deterioration that accelerated in September, which we believe may change course. Meanwhile, casualty pricing accelerated and broadened out across an increasing number of classes. Across both major industry classes, there remains heightened uncertainty in the loss environment. This is driving new risks into the E&S marketplace and causing existing risks to remain there. We have consistently noted that in any cycle, as certain lines are perceived to reach price adequacy, admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. However, this is still not playing out, and the standard market has not meaningfully impacted the rate or flow of our portfolio in the aggregate. We continue to expect the flow of business into the E&S and specialty market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. Now turning to M&A. We continue to execute on our acquisition strategy. First, we completed the acquisition of US Assure. They are performing very well and integration is underway. We completed two more delegated authority transactions in the quarter and two earlier this month. Greenhill, an MGU focused on SME allied health care, will expand our health care MGU, Sapphire Blue. The P&C underwriting business acquired from Ethos with approximately $11 million of revenue will add 8 niche specialty solutions across property and casualty classes. EverSports will add approximately $10 million of revenue and enhance our sports, leisure and entertainment MGU, Alive Risk. Geo Underwriting Europe with a focus on financial lines will further expand our underwriting footprint in the Netherlands and Germany. And as we just recently announced, we are in the process of acquiring Innovisk and expect to close in November. With approximately $58 million of annual revenue, Innovisk brings intellectual capital across seven unique MGUs and an excellent track record of delivering strong underwriting profits to its capital providers. Innovisk adds product offerings to Ryan Specialty, including environmental liability, attorney E&O and tax credit protection coverage. They also provide us with access to incremental segments such as international SME for professional lines and we'll continue expanding our international footprint. We expect each of these acquisitions to contribute to our long-term growth for years to come. We believe we can further enhance these already great businesses through our track record of productivity improvements, including the trusting and reliable trading relationships we have built with our distributors and our capital providers. Further, on the M&A front, our outlook remains ambitious. Our pipeline continues to be robust, including both tuck-ins and large deals. As we previously noted, our overall strategy aims to anticipate and meet the evolving and growing needs of our clients and trading partners so that our value proposition to them remains dynamic and robust. We only move forward when all of our criteria for M&A are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. Turning to talent. We continued to invest strategically in our business in the quarter, adding new talent to our world-class team. These investments across Ryan Specialty and our commitment to independence, innovation and excellence continue to enable industry-leading organic growth and strengthen our competitive position for years to come. I couldn't be prouder of what this team has achieved over the last nearly 15 years but we are just getting started. We are doubling down on our strategy and we will capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeremiah to dive deeper into what distinguishes Ryan Specialty from the competition.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. I'm incredibly excited to step into my new role and continue supporting Pat, Tim and our business leaders on what matters most, delivering value for our clients and trading partners in a few broad but critical areas sustaining our growth engine, both organically and through M&A, investing in a platform that attracts, develops and retains the most talented people in our industry, maintaining our culture, our unique growth and development opportunities and enhancing our teammate experience. Finally, ensuring operational excellence across all of Ryan Specialty. On the topic of operational excellence, I'd like to take a moment to discuss ACCELERATE 2025. As we've said from the beginning, this program has been an investment in our long-term growth. By maturing our operating model, building processes, tools and capabilities, we can help our teammates deliver insights and solutions to our clients with greater speed and efficiency. While a byproduct of this work has been sustained margin improvement, the goal is to drive growth over the long term. Our focus on operational excellence and our goal of leveraging our platform to make expense management a strategic lever goes well beyond the life of ACCELERATE 2025. And on the topic of growth, a focus of mine and everyone else on the call today is to enhance our unique ability to generate outsized organic growth over the long term. In addition to the secular drivers we've previously discussed, our growth is underpinned by several characteristics that distinguish Ryan Specialty from our competition. First is our focus on growth markets. In Wholesale Broking, we focus on capturing broad tailwinds in the specialty market while also capitalizing on specific areas of accelerated growth as they arise. In delegated authority, which is growing faster than the overall E&S market, our underwriters' focus is on delivering consistently profitable underwriting results, growth and scale over the longer term. We believe our proven track record of success in these areas will help us continue expanding our reach in delegated authority and create significant growth opportunities over the long run. Second is our ability to innovate. Whether it's establishing a new class of business, expanding the TAM of delegated authority or crafting customized solutions beyond traditional insurance products, we have a unique blend of creativity, expertise and commitment to client solutions that we believe sets us apart from our competition. This has led to brand distinction and recognition of our ability to solve the most difficult problems for our clients. Third is our ecosystem of excellence. We have a unique culture that is empowering and entrepreneurial. Our platform offers growth and professional development for brokers and underwriters that we believe does not exist anywhere else. We've become a destination of choice for like-minded individuals and professionals who are technical, growth-minded, competitive and passionate about client service. This ecosystem not only fosters industry-leading retention, but it fuels our ability to innovate, evolve and win. Fourth is our unique relationship and position of trust with our trading partners. We represent significant scale, growth and profitability to many of the best institutions in the insurance industry. We believe that we are viewed as more than just a counterparty, but as a force multiplier for their success. We believe this unique status opens doors for us and provides us with more opportunities to innovate, grow and win. Finally, our scale and scope. We believe that the breadth and depth of our capabilities and expertise is unmatched, and it would be incredibly difficult to replicate either organically or inorganically. We believe this provides us with a moat and puts us in the driver's seat as we look ahead. Success begets success and excellence attracts excellence, which is why our pitch to individuals, to teams and to acquisitions has never been stronger. We will leverage this advantage to continue taking an even greater share of our ever-expanding total addressable market. Having been with the firm since nearly its founding, I'm incredibly proud to say that our current growth prospects are more exciting than any period in our history, and our employees are more energized than ever before. Reflecting on the nearly 15 years of the firm's past performance, what has driven our success and market opportunities, I am even more excited for our next 15-year story. With our dynamic and differentiated business model, our expertise, innovative culture and work ethic, we believe we remain well positioned to succeed in 2025 and beyond. We're proud of our team and their dedication to adding value to our clients, trading partners and ultimately, our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Janice Hamilton, who will provide more details on our third quarter financial results. Janice?\nJanice Hamilton : Thank you, Jeremiah. I'm very excited to be speaking with everyone today. In Q3, we grew total revenue 20.5% period-over-period to $605 million. Growth was fueled by another strong quarter of organic revenue growth at 11.8%, contributions from M&A, which added nearly 7 percentage points to our top line and contingent commissions as we delivered strong underwriting profit for our carrier trading partners. Growth was again driven by our ability to win substantial amounts of new business, high renewal retention and ongoing tailwinds in much of the specialty market. Adjusted EBITDAC for the quarter grew 29.4% period-over-period to $190 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin improved 220 basis points to 31.5% driven by another quarter of strong revenue growth, savings from Accelerate 2025 and underlying margin improvement in our business. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% to $0.41 per share. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.1% for the quarter. Based on the current environment, we expect a similar tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2024. Turning to Accelerate 2025. We are in the process of concluding this program by the end of the year. We remain on track to achieve annual savings of approximately $60 million in 2025. We continue to expect that approximately half of these savings will be realized in 2024, with the majority of those savings falling to our bottom line. Earlier today, our board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 payable later next month. Turning to capital allocation. M&A remains our top priority now and for the foreseeable future. The substantial free cash flow we expect to generate will provide us with increasing flexibility for capital allocation opportunities in the future. During the quarter, we refinanced our credit facility with an upsized revolver and an amended and upsized $1.7 billion term loan, improving our borrowing margin from the prior credit agreement. In addition, we priced $600 million of senior secured notes in a private offering at a fixed rate of 5.875%. As of September 30, our leverage remains modest and we have ample capacity to execute on the exciting M&A opportunities ahead of us. We were very pleased with the outcomes for both our credit facility and the senior secured notes. This is a testament to our ongoing operational success, a reflection of our growth strategy and our prudent view of financial risk management. For the fourth quarter, we expect to record GAAP interest expense of $50 million and amortization of deferred issuance costs of $2 million. Now turning to guidance. We are maintaining our organic revenue growth rate guide range for the full year 2024 of 13.0% and 14.0% as well as our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin guide range of 32% to 32.5%. Looking ahead, we will continue to organically invest in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth. We will continue to execute our disciplined M&A strategy with high-quality acquisitions, and we will maintain our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which should create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. With our differentiated business model focused on growth markets, ability to provide innovative solutions to clients and empowering and entrepreneurial culture, unique relationships, scale and scope, we are positioned for success over the long term. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question is on just organic growth, right? I think it's 13.3% right, year-to-date. You left the full year guide, which would imply an uptick, right, from the 11.8% in the Q3 and the fourth quarter. So could you just give us a sense on how Q4 is trending? Because -- and I also thought Q4 is one of your higher property concentration quarters. So are you seeing any impact -- if you -- if the property market does harden post these storms, would you expect there to be an impact in the fourth quarter? Or is that more a 2025 event?\nJeremiah Bickham: Hi, Elyse, there's a lot in that question. So let me lead off by answering it directly related to the Q4 aspect, and then I'll hand it over to Miles and Tim because there's a lot of additional context and color on property, which is a big part of your question. So just the full picture for Q3 and Q4, last year, property in our channel was surging in Q3. And this year, as has been widely discussed now through earnings season, property rates in Q3 were really challenging and in many cases, down 20% to 30%. But why -- one of the reasons I think Pat said at the beginning, he's so proud of what we achieved in this quarter is because, as Tim said, flow matters more than rate. And because so many new risks were entering the channel and because we were able to take market share, we still posted very healthy growth in property and our overall portfolio. And what's really encouraging, too, is that those flow dynamics and our ability to take share are obviously still intact. And there's a chance that rate decline slows down or even levels off later this quarter or by 1/1. There's a good amount of industry speculation on this already. And so far, what we're seeing in Q4 are better results than we had in September and Q3 overall. Now as you know, you pointed out, the quarter is really determined by December because seasonally, that's the biggest, but we're off to a really promising start. And so for the rest of that here, Miles, you should take it away.\nMiles Wuller : Yeah. Thank you, Elyse. Thank you, Jeremiah. I appreciate the question. So look, to add as backdrop, wind-exposed E&S property rates are up approximately 50% on a cumulative basis since Hurricane Ian hit in 2022. We began flagging last quarter, new capital is deployed insurance, reinsurance and ILS capacity over the last six months, pressuring rate. That pressure has certainly been abated by Helene and Milton, but not fully eliminated. That said, there are multiple factors on way we remain bullish on property. First, the macro structural changes that drove this business into E&S still persist. Population density continues to increase in Southeast coastal geographies. Real inflation in property values and building inputs remains high, materially increasing total insured values and climate change remains prevalent as evidenced by the over $100 billion in natural CAT losses this year. Second, our new business submissions remain robust in property as risk transition to the E&S market for the first time, we're drawn to new specialty property facilities we continue to build and buy. And lastly, we remain a destination choice for capacity providers. We continue to deliver underwriting performance and less volatility throughout the cycle. Through this cycle, we've been steadily attracting incremental capacity to better serve our clients. I think Tim is going to add as well.\nTim Turner : Sure. Thanks, Miles. We see the CAT property market in a short-term transition. Rate deceleration in CAT property accelerated in September with two CAT 3s in 10 days plus record convective storms, we fully expect the CAT property market to stabilize. Our property flow in October looks very strong. Obviously, climate change, global warming is not going away. But it's too early to forecast the fourth quarter as 1/1 treaties will validate the market condition for 2025. But overall, the E&S market remains very, very firm and our double-digit growth and expanding looks very optimistic.\nElyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then on the flip side with storms, right, sometimes there's an impact on contingent commissions. Did you see any impact in Q3 when you expect any impact in the fourth quarter?\nMiles Wuller : Well, Elyse, they have been steadily increasing. So I would say the increasing profit commissions for both the quarter and the year have exceeded expectations and they're the direct result of our investment in top decile staff, our delegated authority platform and our high standard of care in underwriting and risk selection. So we -- if you would recall, these are typically earned over -- excuse me, recognized over three to five years after they've been delivered. But no, all signs to date are we have exceeded all modeled expectations for the storms this year, and we expect this flow to continue.\nElyse Greenspan : And then my last question, right, there were -- there was a press release and you guys mentioned it about the Innovisk Capital Partners transaction. I know there was disclosure, right, in terms of revenue. Anything you could just say in terms of potential purchase price or the margin of that property, just to help us think about just modeling when this transaction does close?\nJanice Hamilton : Sure, Elyse. I'll take that. So Innovisk, you've caught the revenue impact of that being $58 million. This deal is well within our delegated authority specialty, which tends to have a slightly higher margin. Don't think about the U.S. Assure style margin, but we wouldn't expect there to be a material impact as a result of Innovisk to our margin profile.\nElyse Greenspan : And then anything on the purchase price?\nJanice Hamilton : Not at this time.\nElyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott, Barclays.\nAlex Scott: Hi, I had a similar line of questioning as Elyse's questions on property, but on the casualty side, I was just interested in what are some of the things you're seeing in the E&S market in terms of volume flow and so forth on casualty with what's going on with loss cost trend and some repricing efforts seemingly underway?\nTim Turner : Alex, we see the casualty market continuing to firm, especially in the high-hazard practice group verticals where we spend most of our time, loss leaders in the reinsurance world, high hazard casualty business, in particular, led by transportation, consumer product liability, social and human services, to name a few, continue to deteriorate. Losses, loss cost adjustment factors, continue to drive the business into the channel. So we see double-digit growth in casualty. It helped us overcome the property wins in the quarter, and we see nothing but a long runway in high hazard casualty.\nAlex Scott: And any way you could help us think through just sort of allocation towards property versus casualty? And I'm just trying to understand the two different impacts and how powerful casualty could be if property does indeed moderate in terms of the price declines?\nTim Turner : Well, casualty in the broader sense includes professional liability. And professional liabilities, we know, had some public D&O and some cyber headwinds. But even those are abating, and we're seeing real measurable growth now across all our professional liability pro-exec classes of business, led by health care and miscellaneous E&O classes like architect and engineers. So we're very, very bullish on professional liability as it's woven into casualty, roughly two thirds of our book, we see it gaining momentum in the fourth quarter, almost a second firming emerging in the marketplace, again, due to deterioration in losses, loss cost adjustment factors accelerating and more dumping and shedding by the standard markets into our channel. So very optimistic outlook.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Grace Carter, Bank of America.\nGrace Carter : Hi, everyone. I was wondering when you started to see the decline in property pricing start to kind of accelerate late in the quarter. Was there any sort of influence on customer purchase activity, for example, maybe seeing people buy more coverage than they might have recently had to forego due to pricing or people just kind of opting to take the net savings?\nTim Turner : I'll take the first part of that and let Miles complement that. We saw very high retention rates on our renewal book. So we're not losing any business to the admitted market. And the -- while the prices went down, we were able to hang on to our layers and continue to write new business. Our new business flow has been very impressive, even though we had this outlying deceleration accelerate in September. We really believe it's an outlier. We think the market will bounce back quickly after two CAT 3s and the total impact of the convective storm season, and we're starting to see that already. October property flow looks very strong.\nMiles Wuller : And structurally, we have seen your observation play out. The end buyers enhanced purchasing power, they have tended to use that to buy lower deductibles or most of this property obviously has mortgage or loans against it. But in some cases, property, the insurance is only up to the loan value, not the total TIV. So we have seen people redeploy that spend back into the -- towards the full total insured value of their assets.\nGrace Carter : Thank you. And would you be able to give us an update on the amount of competition coming out of the London market?\nTim Turner : London is a great partner to us. They're a large E&S market in the U.S. and multiple access points, and they're competitive. But I wouldn't say anything beyond that. They're definitely a leader in the E&S market and property is part of that appetite, but not much beyond that.\nGrace Carter : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Up next is Meyer Shields of KBW.\nMeyer Shields : Hi, good afternoon, all. A couple of hopefully quick questions. First, overall, is there a challenge in finding even E&S market capacity for transportation risk?\nTim Turner : I didn't hear the first part of the question, I'm sorry.\nMeyer Shields : Not at all. I'm wondering, I know that a number of insurance companies are cautious on commercial auto, and you mentioned it as a line of business driving the refirming of casualty. And I just want to see whether there's any actual shortage of capacity. Like do you ever encounter difficulties in placing these programs even if they move to E&S markets?\nTim Turner : Transportation is without a doubt one of the hardest parts of the casualty market and that's widespread. It's primary trucking, it's livery. It's shared economy, it's primary and it's excess, it's binding authorities. It's MGUs, it's direct placements. So there's a lot going on in that space mayor. Part of it is the migration of the business from delegated underwriting authority into the brokerage market. So we're very well prepared to broker more transportation than we would underwrite in the past and very well prepared for this firming so lots of dumping and shedding in every class in 50 states in transportation. So a very exciting opportunity for us to solve these problems and challenges for our clients.\nMeyer Shields : Okay. That's helpful. And a couple of numbers questions. I guess in the second quarter, we saw more improvement in the adjusted G&A ratio. Then in compensation, and that reversed, there was more improvement in compensation in the third quarter. And I don't know whether that related to faster growth in delegated authority or is something else impacting the trend of those individual expense ratios?\nJanice Hamilton : Meyer, I'm happy to take that. What you saw this quarter was the actioning of our savings from the Accelerate 2025 program, primarily just playing out the difference between when those were effective for both comp and G&A.\nMeyer Shields : Okay. So it's not related to mix at all?\nJanice Hamilton : No.\nMeyer Shields : Okay. And then related, when we think about fiduciary investment income, I guess the assets associated with that, does mix play a role there?\nTim Turner : Sorry, Meyer, does mix play a role in what?\nMeyer Shields : In the fiduciary investment income or the assets there, when you -- if you see faster growth in delegated authority, do that automatically imply either upward or downward trends in fiduciary investment income?\nJanice Hamilton : No, no.\nMeyer Shields : Perfect. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski, BMO Capital Markets.\nMike Zaremski : Good evening. First question on panel consolidation. I think intuitively to us, it makes sense that it's -- this is a tail growth. I haven't been able to crack the code on trying to figure out how it's benefiting your growth. Do you -- would you guys be willing to share what your data is telling you of the 13 to 14 points of growth you're going to throw off this year, how many points of that or basis points of that you think has come from panel consolidation even if it's just a rough estimate?\nJeremiah Bickham : That would be a tough measure to share. But broadly speaking, panel consolidation, we consider part of when we say new client wins and winning new business, taking new share, that's all part of that. And it's -- there's a lot of overlap between that and just day-to-day winning in the trenches, like our success in doing book rolls and becoming preferred partners is all because we prove day-to-day that we can meet the needs and that our specialty verticals are a comprehensive solution to these firms. So it's very much a part of the portfolio today. And the reason we gave it a little bit of elevated airtime today on the call is because there's a lot -- like our -- the scale and sophistication of our industry has increased dramatically even in the last five years. And there is a recognition even more so today than certainly 15 years ago, but even 5 years ago of the power that strategic relationships like wholesalers like us at scale can provide to clients who are looking to minimize E&O or just like win more business. And we're benefiting from that, and we see the billions of unconsolidated premium out there among existing retail partners as being up for grabs over the next couple of years. And the statement today is that we're ready and we're already actively engaged trying to help our clients optimize their portfolios that way.\nMike Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful. And I think we appreciate it's tough to get the exact data from your clients to probably able to really pinpoint a number on it. Okay. I guess going back to the property conversation, just when I heard your prepared remarks about the property pricing deterioration accelerating, but you think it can change course. Like are you seeing in real time in recent weeks it changing course? Because it feels like the insurers on Milton, for example, we just saw PCS came out with it only being a $5 billion loss so far. Obviously, devastating, but $5 billion is a pretty low number but maybe it's just early days. So it feels like there's conflicting data points out there on whether the market -- the property market really indeed will flatten out? Thanks.\nTim Turner : Jeremiah, mentioned we were seeing some accelerated rate deceleration as we move through September, 10%, 20% at times, aggressive pricing competitive. And then post both CAT 3s and the convective storm totals really had an impact here over the last 30 days. So to your question, we have seen evidence and validation of the market stabilizing in CAT property. And we believe that we're now in a minus 5%, flat to plus 5% range roughly in that range. But we -- it's too early to really forecast that, but we are seeing evidence of it clearly.\nMike Zaremski : Okay. And I guess just lastly on overall organic growth on the guidance, we can all just do the math on what the guide implies for 4Q and at the midpoint, it would imply the guide for the full year would imply a sequential bump up in organic in 4Q. Just given the portfolio is shaped differently this year than in the past years, is there any more just nuanced seasonality we should be thinking about that's different in 4Q versus historical 4Q? Or just anything we should keep in mind seasonality-wise?\nJeremiah Bickham: No, no material change to the seasonality that we've discussed before. Q4 is still the biggest quarter overall for total revenue. It's the second biggest quarter for property. And our optimism, our confidence on achieving our guide range is informed by information through today. And as we said in the prepared remarks, the quarter is off to a good start.\nMike Zaremski : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Rob Cox, Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox : Great. Thanks. Some of the data we've seen is that the mission growth has picked up meaningfully in the last few quarters for some of the larger stamping office states as pricing has fallen. I'm wondering if seeing elevated submission growth as pricing falls is consistent with typical E&S cyclicality? And if there's any color you could provide to help us better understand that dynamic?\nTim Turner : We're certainly seeing the flow in those larger states from the stamping offices, double-digit growth actually. While we don't use a month or even a quarter to measure it nationally, we wait for the annual results to come out. We are seeing real strong evidence that the flow into the channel, i.e., the non-renewal notices, the dumping and the shedding of unprofitable business is definitely growing rapidly, and we're capturing our fair share of it. And it's in these loss-leading channels, as we've mentioned. And so we're perfectly set up to broker it and to underwrite it.\nRobert Cox : Okay. Thanks. And maybe shifting to the -- back to the property. I think you guys had previously disclosed that your property mix was kind of in line with the industry at 30% or so, if I'm not mistaken. I think that since then, maybe the industry has grown to about 40% property in E&S. So I was wondering if that 40% would be closer to the right figure today?\nJeremiah Bickham: We -- our mix has ticked up a little bit, but what Tim said earlier, two thirds, one thirds is still the right way to think about it, two thirds casualty, one thirds property.\nRobert Cox : Okay. And maybe last question, just on the transaction liability and the exposure to capital markets. It seems like a positive in the quarter. I think some of the large retail brokers said it was a double-digit growth engine for them. Is there any way to size the impact to organic growth in the quarter?\nMiles Wuller : Well, Rob, we wouldn't share it on a broken out basis, but we can confirm. It's been a great contributor. We're really pleased with the investments we've made globally, particularly in tax as well over the last two years and it is a contributor to our overall organic growth for the full year and quarter.\nRobert Cox : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. It looks like there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Pat Ryan for closing comments.\nPat Ryan: We certainly appreciate you taking the time to join us today, and we appreciate your continued support. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Have a good evening. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tim Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. I'm honored to take the baton from Pat and speak with everyone today as Ryan Specialty's CEO. For nearly 15 years, I've dedicated myself to the success of this firm and our teammates, and I couldn't be prouder of what this team has achieved thus far. In many ways, we have already accomplished more than we imagined in 2010 when Pat and I were just getting started. What has me so energized and so motivated right now, though, is my belief that we have the opportunity to dwarf our accomplishments to date. As Pat said a moment ago, we are stronger than ever and have growth opportunities now that did not exist for us previously. Our conviction to put our clients first, our focus on specialized expertise, our commitment to rewarding top talent and our dedication to excellence in everything we do is being validated by the market every day. Our exceptional growth, our success at recruiting and our unique M&A opportunities are all a reflection of that. Rather than being satisfied with our accomplishments thus far, we are doubling down on our strategy and putting everything we have into capitalizing on the opportunities in front of us. Our goal is not just to continue our momentum but to accelerate it. As we pull ahead of the competition, we're charging harder than ever. We have more firepower, more passion and a better story to tell than we've ever had before. I couldn't be more excited. With that as a backdrop, I'd like to set the stage with three important points. After that, I will walk through our performance by specialty, observations on industry trends, progress on our M&A strategy and investments that we're making in the business. The first point I would like to make is on independence. We are very serious about putting our clients first and a key element of independence is that we don't compete with the retail brokers and agents we aim to serve. With each passing day, the value of independence is becoming more and more of an obvious truth. However, this has been a cornerstone of our strategy and the North Star of our client-first philosophy since our founding. We believe this commitment to our clients has been a crucial part of our success and will be going forward. The second point I would like to make is on the durable value proposition of delegated underwriting authority. This is a principle that our firm was founded on and it's one that's gained significant traction in recent years. It is our closely held belief that delegated authority is not only here to stay but will continue gaining momentum as the value proposition is self-evident. However, the long-term success of the model is dependent on intermediaries like Ryan Specialty, who manage delegated authority with the highest professional standards. We honor our fiduciary responsibility to our capital providers and have demonstrated to them that we're not interested in growth at any cost. Their profitability has to come first. Doing this the right way requires not only that commitment, but the ongoing investment in talent, technology and governance to make sure that commitment is honored. This is an area that sets us apart and one we will continue to leverage to deepen our penetration in the delegated authority space. The third and final point I'll make before getting to the results is on panel consolidation. There is a growing recognition among retail brokers of the need to optimize client outcomes, minimize E&Os and invest in long-term strategic relationships that help them win. As the world continues to get riskier and more complex, we believe that deep industry specialization and a focus on fast, consistent execution is the only way to earn and keep business in our industry, and we stand ready to deliver that to our clients every single day. Now on to the results. As Pat noted, it was another exceptional quarter for Ryan Specialty. We executed well across our strategic, financial and operational objectives. We had broad-based growth across our specialties, meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions and delivered strong underwriting profit for our carrier trading partners. Diving into our specialties, our wholesale brokerage specialty generated another quarter of strong growth. Our property practice had another impressive quarter of growth. We overcame what we believe to be short-term headwinds as property pricing deteriorated throughout the quarter and prior to Hurricanes Helene and Milton. We also overcame a tough comparable in a market that was seeing strong pricing increases in the prior year. We overcame these trends as we generated excellent new business, took share of strong flow into the channel and won head-to-head against our competitors and had high retention. Prior to this year's hurricane season, we continue to see expanded catastrophe appetite as additional capacity entered the market. Recently, the market has been working through the impact of two devastating hurricanes and a record year of severe convective storms. It is still too early to know for sure how the insurance and reinsurance markets will react, but many industry sources are pointing to renewals being flat to up by 1/1. We can deliver significant value to our clients in any market cycle through our deep specialty and industry capabilities and ability to navigate this dynamic environment. Property will be an important contributor to our growth moving forward and a very strong part of our portfolio over the long term. Our casualty practice had another excellent quarter. A challenging loss environment is driving higher loss costs in numerous casualty classes. This is partly driven by social inflation, marked by increased frequency and more prolonged cases, higher settlements, judgments and nuclear verdicts and amplified by litigation finance and partly by reserve charges related to the 2015 through 2019 accident years and the recognition of reserve inadequacy for more recent years. The market is reacting to these trends by raising prices, focusing on limit management and moving risks into the specialty and E&S market. As a result, the need for our specialized industry and product level knowledge has never been greater and our value proposition to our clients has never been stronger. We remain confident that casualty will be a strong driver of our growth moving forward and that we will continue to be a leader in casualty solutions for years to come. Now turning to our delegated authority specialties, which include both binding and underwriting management. Our binding authority specialty continues to perform very well, driven by our top-tier talent and expanding product set for small, tough-to-place commercial P&C risks. We continue to believe panel consolidation in binding authority and programs remains a long-term growth opportunity and we are well positioned to capitalize. Our underwriting management specialty had another outstanding quarter, particularly in M&A transactional liability, health care and property and casualty. Growth was aided by meaningful contributions from recent acquisitions and contingent commissions as we delivered strong underwriting profit for our carrier trading partners. Stepping back, our delegated authority specialties remains very well positioned to execute on both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We are confident in our talent, our platform and our ability to remain a destination of choice for high-quality MGUs and their specialized talent. We believe this combination, paired with our skill to manage the business through the insurance cycle ensures our ability to deliver consistently profitable underwriting results, growth and scale over the long term. Our success and track record of excellent underwriting results have accelerated our speed to market, developed broader and deeper relationships across our carrier trading partners and onboarded additional capacity. Turning to price. After years of significant pricing increases, including in the prior year's quarter, property pricing was down in Q3 with a deterioration that accelerated in September, which we believe may change course. Meanwhile, casualty pricing accelerated and broadened out across an increasing number of classes. Across both major industry classes, there remains heightened uncertainty in the loss environment. This is driving new risks into the E&S marketplace and causing existing risks to remain there. We have consistently noted that in any cycle, as certain lines are perceived to reach price adequacy, admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. However, this is still not playing out, and the standard market has not meaningfully impacted the rate or flow of our portfolio in the aggregate. We continue to expect the flow of business into the E&S and specialty market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. Now turning to M&A. We continue to execute on our acquisition strategy. First, we completed the acquisition of US Assure. They are performing very well and integration is underway. We completed two more delegated authority transactions in the quarter and two earlier this month. Greenhill, an MGU focused on SME allied health care, will expand our health care MGU, Sapphire Blue. The P&C underwriting business acquired from Ethos with approximately $11 million of revenue will add 8 niche specialty solutions across property and casualty classes. EverSports will add approximately $10 million of revenue and enhance our sports, leisure and entertainment MGU, Alive Risk. Geo Underwriting Europe with a focus on financial lines will further expand our underwriting footprint in the Netherlands and Germany. And as we just recently announced, we are in the process of acquiring Innovisk and expect to close in November. With approximately $58 million of annual revenue, Innovisk brings intellectual capital across seven unique MGUs and an excellent track record of delivering strong underwriting profits to its capital providers. Innovisk adds product offerings to Ryan Specialty, including environmental liability, attorney E&O and tax credit protection coverage. They also provide us with access to incremental segments such as international SME for professional lines and we'll continue expanding our international footprint. We expect each of these acquisitions to contribute to our long-term growth for years to come. We believe we can further enhance these already great businesses through our track record of productivity improvements, including the trusting and reliable trading relationships we have built with our distributors and our capital providers. Further, on the M&A front, our outlook remains ambitious. Our pipeline continues to be robust, including both tuck-ins and large deals. As we previously noted, our overall strategy aims to anticipate and meet the evolving and growing needs of our clients and trading partners so that our value proposition to them remains dynamic and robust. We only move forward when all of our criteria for M&A are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. Turning to talent. We continued to invest strategically in our business in the quarter, adding new talent to our world-class team. These investments across Ryan Specialty and our commitment to independence, innovation and excellence continue to enable industry-leading organic growth and strengthen our competitive position for years to come. I couldn't be prouder of what this team has achieved over the last nearly 15 years but we are just getting started. We are doubling down on our strategy and we will capitalize on the opportunities in front of us. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jeremiah to dive deeper into what distinguishes Ryan Specialty from the competition. Sure. Thanks, Miles. We see the CAT property market in a short-term transition. Rate deceleration in CAT property accelerated in September with two CAT 3s in 10 days plus record convective storms, we fully expect the CAT property market to stabilize. Our property flow in October looks very strong. Obviously, climate change, global warming is not going away. But it's too early to forecast the fourth quarter as 1/1 treaties will validate the market condition for 2025. But overall, the E&S market remains very, very firm and our double-digit growth and expanding looks very optimistic. Alex, we see the casualty market continuing to firm, especially in the high-hazard practice group verticals where we spend most of our time, loss leaders in the reinsurance world, high hazard casualty business, in particular, led by transportation, consumer product liability, social and human services, to name a few, continue to deteriorate. Losses, loss cost adjustment factors, continue to drive the business into the channel. So we see double-digit growth in casualty. It helped us overcome the property wins in the quarter, and we see nothing but a long runway in high hazard casualty. Well, casualty in the broader sense includes professional liability. And professional liabilities, we know, had some public D&O and some cyber headwinds. But even those are abating, and we're seeing real measurable growth now across all our professional liability pro-exec classes of business, led by health care and miscellaneous E&O classes like architect and engineers. So we're very, very bullish on professional liability as it's woven into casualty, roughly two thirds of our book, we see it gaining momentum in the fourth quarter, almost a second firming emerging in the marketplace, again, due to deterioration in losses, loss cost adjustment factors accelerating and more dumping and shedding by the standard markets into our channel. So very optimistic outlook. I'll take the first part of that and let Miles complement that. We saw very high retention rates on our renewal book. So we're not losing any business to the admitted market. And the -- while the prices went down, we were able to hang on to our layers and continue to write new business. Our new business flow has been very impressive, even though we had this outlying deceleration accelerate in September. We really believe it's an outlier. We think the market will bounce back quickly after two CAT 3s and the total impact of the convective storm season, and we're starting to see that already. October property flow looks very strong. London is a great partner to us. They're a large E&S market in the U.S. and multiple access points, and they're competitive. But I wouldn't say anything beyond that. They're definitely a leader in the E&S market and property is part of that appetite, but not much beyond that. I didn't hear the first part of the question, I'm sorry. Transportation is without a doubt one of the hardest parts of the casualty market and that's widespread. It's primary trucking, it's livery. It's shared economy, it's primary and it's excess, it's binding authorities. It's MGUs, it's direct placements. So there's a lot going on in that space mayor. Part of it is the migration of the business from delegated underwriting authority into the brokerage market. So we're very well prepared to broker more transportation than we would underwrite in the past and very well prepared for this firming so lots of dumping and shedding in every class in 50 states in transportation. So a very exciting opportunity for us to solve these problems and challenges for our clients. Sorry, Meyer, does mix play a role in what? Jeremiah, mentioned we were seeing some accelerated rate deceleration as we move through September, 10%, 20% at times, aggressive pricing competitive. And then post both CAT 3s and the convective storm totals really had an impact here over the last 30 days. So to your question, we have seen evidence and validation of the market stabilizing in CAT property. And we believe that we're now in a minus 5%, flat to plus 5% range roughly in that range. But we -- it's too early to really forecast that, but we are seeing evidence of it clearly. We're certainly seeing the flow in those larger states from the stamping offices, double-digit growth actually. While we don't use a month or even a quarter to measure it nationally, we wait for the annual results to come out. We are seeing real strong evidence that the flow into the channel, i.e., the non-renewal notices, the dumping and the shedding of unprofitable business is definitely growing rapidly, and we're capturing our fair share of it. And it's in these loss-leading channels, as we've mentioned. And so we're perfectly set up to broker it and to underwrite it."

            "name": "Jeremiah Bickham",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. I'm incredibly excited to step into my new role and continue supporting Pat, Tim and our business leaders on what matters most, delivering value for our clients and trading partners in a few broad but critical areas sustaining our growth engine, both organically and through M&A, investing in a platform that attracts, develops and retains the most talented people in our industry, maintaining our culture, our unique growth and development opportunities and enhancing our teammate experience. Finally, ensuring operational excellence across all of Ryan Specialty. On the topic of operational excellence, I'd like to take a moment to discuss ACCELERATE 2025. As we've said from the beginning, this program has been an investment in our long-term growth. By maturing our operating model, building processes, tools and capabilities, we can help our teammates deliver insights and solutions to our clients with greater speed and efficiency. While a byproduct of this work has been sustained margin improvement, the goal is to drive growth over the long term. Our focus on operational excellence and our goal of leveraging our platform to make expense management a strategic lever goes well beyond the life of ACCELERATE 2025. And on the topic of growth, a focus of mine and everyone else on the call today is to enhance our unique ability to generate outsized organic growth over the long term. In addition to the secular drivers we've previously discussed, our growth is underpinned by several characteristics that distinguish Ryan Specialty from our competition. First is our focus on growth markets. In Wholesale Broking, we focus on capturing broad tailwinds in the specialty market while also capitalizing on specific areas of accelerated growth as they arise. In delegated authority, which is growing faster than the overall E&S market, our underwriters' focus is on delivering consistently profitable underwriting results, growth and scale over the longer term. We believe our proven track record of success in these areas will help us continue expanding our reach in delegated authority and create significant growth opportunities over the long run. Second is our ability to innovate. Whether it's establishing a new class of business, expanding the TAM of delegated authority or crafting customized solutions beyond traditional insurance products, we have a unique blend of creativity, expertise and commitment to client solutions that we believe sets us apart from our competition. This has led to brand distinction and recognition of our ability to solve the most difficult problems for our clients. Third is our ecosystem of excellence. We have a unique culture that is empowering and entrepreneurial. Our platform offers growth and professional development for brokers and underwriters that we believe does not exist anywhere else. We've become a destination of choice for like-minded individuals and professionals who are technical, growth-minded, competitive and passionate about client service. This ecosystem not only fosters industry-leading retention, but it fuels our ability to innovate, evolve and win. Fourth is our unique relationship and position of trust with our trading partners. We represent significant scale, growth and profitability to many of the best institutions in the insurance industry. We believe that we are viewed as more than just a counterparty, but as a force multiplier for their success. We believe this unique status opens doors for us and provides us with more opportunities to innovate, grow and win. Finally, our scale and scope. We believe that the breadth and depth of our capabilities and expertise is unmatched, and it would be incredibly difficult to replicate either organically or inorganically. We believe this provides us with a moat and puts us in the driver's seat as we look ahead. Success begets success and excellence attracts excellence, which is why our pitch to individuals, to teams and to acquisitions has never been stronger. We will leverage this advantage to continue taking an even greater share of our ever-expanding total addressable market. Having been with the firm since nearly its founding, I'm incredibly proud to say that our current growth prospects are more exciting than any period in our history, and our employees are more energized than ever before. Reflecting on the nearly 15 years of the firm's past performance, what has driven our success and market opportunities, I am even more excited for our next 15-year story. With our dynamic and differentiated business model, our expertise, innovative culture and work ethic, we believe we remain well positioned to succeed in 2025 and beyond. We're proud of our team and their dedication to adding value to our clients, trading partners and ultimately, our shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Janice Hamilton, who will provide more details on our third quarter financial results. Janice? Hi, Elyse, there's a lot in that question. So let me lead off by answering it directly related to the Q4 aspect, and then I'll hand it over to Miles and Tim because there's a lot of additional context and color on property, which is a big part of your question. So just the full picture for Q3 and Q4, last year, property in our channel was surging in Q3. And this year, as has been widely discussed now through earnings season, property rates in Q3 were really challenging and in many cases, down 20% to 30%. But why -- one of the reasons I think Pat said at the beginning, he's so proud of what we achieved in this quarter is because, as Tim said, flow matters more than rate. And because so many new risks were entering the channel and because we were able to take market share, we still posted very healthy growth in property and our overall portfolio. And what's really encouraging, too, is that those flow dynamics and our ability to take share are obviously still intact. And there's a chance that rate decline slows down or even levels off later this quarter or by 1/1. There's a good amount of industry speculation on this already. And so far, what we're seeing in Q4 are better results than we had in September and Q3 overall. Now as you know, you pointed out, the quarter is really determined by December because seasonally, that's the biggest, but we're off to a really promising start. And so for the rest of that here, Miles, you should take it away. That would be a tough measure to share. But broadly speaking, panel consolidation, we consider part of when we say new client wins and winning new business, taking new share, that's all part of that. And it's -- there's a lot of overlap between that and just day-to-day winning in the trenches, like our success in doing book rolls and becoming preferred partners is all because we prove day-to-day that we can meet the needs and that our specialty verticals are a comprehensive solution to these firms. So it's very much a part of the portfolio today. And the reason we gave it a little bit of elevated airtime today on the call is because there's a lot -- like our -- the scale and sophistication of our industry has increased dramatically even in the last five years. And there is a recognition even more so today than certainly 15 years ago, but even 5 years ago of the power that strategic relationships like wholesalers like us at scale can provide to clients who are looking to minimize E&O or just like win more business. And we're benefiting from that, and we see the billions of unconsolidated premium out there among existing retail partners as being up for grabs over the next couple of years. And the statement today is that we're ready and we're already actively engaged trying to help our clients optimize their portfolios that way. No, no material change to the seasonality that we've discussed before. Q4 is still the biggest quarter overall for total revenue. It's the second biggest quarter for property. And our optimism, our confidence on achieving our guide range is informed by information through today. And as we said in the prepared remarks, the quarter is off to a good start. We -- our mix has ticked up a little bit, but what Tim said earlier, two thirds, one thirds is still the right way to think about it, two thirds casualty, one thirds property."

            "name": "Miles Wuller",
            "content": "Yeah. Thank you, Elyse. Thank you, Jeremiah. I appreciate the question. So look, to add as backdrop, wind-exposed E&S property rates are up approximately 50% on a cumulative basis since Hurricane Ian hit in 2022. We began flagging last quarter, new capital is deployed insurance, reinsurance and ILS capacity over the last six months, pressuring rate. That pressure has certainly been abated by Helene and Milton, but not fully eliminated. That said, there are multiple factors on way we remain bullish on property. First, the macro structural changes that drove this business into E&S still persist. Population density continues to increase in Southeast coastal geographies. Real inflation in property values and building inputs remains high, materially increasing total insured values and climate change remains prevalent as evidenced by the over $100 billion in natural CAT losses this year. Second, our new business submissions remain robust in property as risk transition to the E&S market for the first time, we're drawn to new specialty property facilities we continue to build and buy. And lastly, we remain a destination choice for capacity providers. We continue to deliver underwriting performance and less volatility throughout the cycle. Through this cycle, we've been steadily attracting incremental capacity to better serve our clients. I think Tim is going to add as well. Well, Elyse, they have been steadily increasing. So I would say the increasing profit commissions for both the quarter and the year have exceeded expectations and they're the direct result of our investment in top decile staff, our delegated authority platform and our high standard of care in underwriting and risk selection. So we -- if you would recall, these are typically earned over -- excuse me, recognized over three to five years after they've been delivered. But no, all signs to date are we have exceeded all modeled expectations for the storms this year, and we expect this flow to continue. And structurally, we have seen your observation play out. The end buyers enhanced purchasing power, they have tended to use that to buy lower deductibles or most of this property obviously has mortgage or loans against it. But in some cases, property, the insurance is only up to the loan value, not the total TIV. So we have seen people redeploy that spend back into the -- towards the full total insured value of their assets. Well, Rob, we wouldn't share it on a broken out basis, but we can confirm. It's been a great contributor. We're really pleased with the investments we've made globally, particularly in tax as well over the last two years and it is a contributor to our overall organic growth for the full year and quarter."

With me on today's call is our CEO, Tim Turner; our President, Jeremiah Bickham; our CFO, Janice Hamilton; our CEO of Underwriting Managers, Miles Wuller; and our Director of Investor Relations, Nick Mezick. We delivered an excellent third quarter by all measures. We grew total revenue 20.5%, which includes strong organic revenue growth of 11.8% and meaningful contributions from M&A. I'd like to pause for a moment to express how proud I am of these accomplishments this quarter, most specifically our organic growth. Our organic growth in Q3 of last year was 15% and was buttressed by a surge of growth in property. So that's quite a comp in which to compound. In contrast, this past quarter, we faced what we believe to be short-term headwinds as property rate deterioration accelerated in September prior to hurricanes Helene and Milton. We're taking market share of both new risks and renewals in the E&S market, we overcame these headwinds and posted very healthy growth in property and in our overall portfolio. All in all, 20.5% total growth and 11.8% organic growth for the quarter under these circumstances is further proof of Ryan Specialty's resilience and growth engine. We grew adjusted EBITDAC 29.4% to $190 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 220 basis points to 31.5% and adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% to $0.41 per share. We also had a very active quarter for acquisitions, which aligns with our disciplined long-term M&A strategy. We target high-quality businesses with differentiated talent, which provides us with more capabilities to meet our clients' evolving and growing needs. We're very excited about the talent and tools we added to Ryan Specialty in Q3, which Tim will discuss shortly. Further, our leadership succession plan was executed seamlessly on October 1. I'm very proud to have Tim sitting next to me today as Ryan Specialty's new CEO. I'm confident that we have the right team in place to continue executing our winning strategy today and over the long term. Ryan Specialty is stronger than ever, and our teammates are excited for the future. We believe that we will continue to deliver innovative solutions to our clients, generate industry-leading organic growth, execute our M&A strategy, continue to increase profitability and create additional value for our shareholders. Now I'm pleased to turn the call over to Tim. Tim? We certainly appreciate you taking the time to join us today, and we appreciate your continued support. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Have a good evening. Thank you."

            "name": "Janice Hamilton",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremiah. I'm very excited to be speaking with everyone today. In Q3, we grew total revenue 20.5% period-over-period to $605 million. Growth was fueled by another strong quarter of organic revenue growth at 11.8%, contributions from M&A, which added nearly 7 percentage points to our top line and contingent commissions as we delivered strong underwriting profit for our carrier trading partners. Growth was again driven by our ability to win substantial amounts of new business, high renewal retention and ongoing tailwinds in much of the specialty market. Adjusted EBITDAC for the quarter grew 29.4% period-over-period to $190 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin improved 220 basis points to 31.5% driven by another quarter of strong revenue growth, savings from Accelerate 2025 and underlying margin improvement in our business. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% to $0.41 per share. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.1% for the quarter. Based on the current environment, we expect a similar tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2024. Turning to Accelerate 2025. We are in the process of concluding this program by the end of the year. We remain on track to achieve annual savings of approximately $60 million in 2025. We continue to expect that approximately half of these savings will be realized in 2024, with the majority of those savings falling to our bottom line. Earlier today, our board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 payable later next month. Turning to capital allocation. M&A remains our top priority now and for the foreseeable future. The substantial free cash flow we expect to generate will provide us with increasing flexibility for capital allocation opportunities in the future. During the quarter, we refinanced our credit facility with an upsized revolver and an amended and upsized $1.7 billion term loan, improving our borrowing margin from the prior credit agreement. In addition, we priced $600 million of senior secured notes in a private offering at a fixed rate of 5.875%. As of September 30, our leverage remains modest and we have ample capacity to execute on the exciting M&A opportunities ahead of us. We were very pleased with the outcomes for both our credit facility and the senior secured notes. This is a testament to our ongoing operational success, a reflection of our growth strategy and our prudent view of financial risk management. For the fourth quarter, we expect to record GAAP interest expense of $50 million and amortization of deferred issuance costs of $2 million. Now turning to guidance. We are maintaining our organic revenue growth rate guide range for the full year 2024 of 13.0% and 14.0% as well as our full year adjusted EBITDAC margin guide range of 32% to 32.5%. Looking ahead, we will continue to organically invest in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth. We will continue to execute our disciplined M&A strategy with high-quality acquisitions, and we will maintain our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which should create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. With our differentiated business model focused on growth markets, ability to provide innovative solutions to clients and empowering and entrepreneurial culture, unique relationships, scale and scope, we are positioned for success over the long term. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Sure, Elyse. I'll take that. So Innovisk, you've caught the revenue impact of that being $58 million. This deal is well within our delegated authority specialty, which tends to have a slightly higher margin. Don't think about the U.S. Assure style margin, but we wouldn't expect there to be a material impact as a result of Innovisk to our margin profile. Not at this time. Meyer, I'm happy to take that. What you saw this quarter was the actioning of our savings from the Accelerate 2025 program, primarily just playing out the difference between when those were effective for both comp and G&A. No. No, no."

In addition to this call, the company filed a press release with the SEC earlier this afternoon, which has also been posted to its website at ryanspecialty.com. On today's call, management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.

With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryan Specialty, Pat Ryan.\nPatrick Ryan:\nHamilton: Our second quarter continued our strong momentum, excellent top and bottom line results, reflecting our formidable value proposition, differentiated talent and niche specialization. Total revenue grew 18.8% year-over-year to $695 million, driven by organic growth of 14.2% on top of the strong growth we posted in the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDAC grew 27.6% to $248 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 240 basis points to 35.6%, driven by another quarter of strong revenue growth, savings from ACCELERATE 2025 and underlying margin improvement in our business. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.9% to $0.58 per share. Now turning to Slide 3 of our supplemental presentation. Today we announced an agreement to acquire US Assure, a leading program focused exclusively on builder's risk insurance. We're excited about this transaction for several reasons. We're significantly expanding Ryan Specialty's broker relationships and total addressable market. US Assure meaningfully increases our footprint in the Programs segment of Delegated Underwriting Authority. We're pleased to be executing on our M&A focus in this area as we see it as ripe for consolidation. We are deepening our capabilities in attractive markets. We will enhance our capability in the attractive SME segment of the builders risk and construction market, which more broadly is a major and fast growing component of U.S. GDP. We are adding a strong and valuable solution set. Having placed business online for over 25 years, US Assure's distribution portal is a unique asset offering an efficient and cost effective tool that provides a one-stop solution accessed by over 20,000 retailers. This innovative offering provides fully automated, rapid and seamless quote, find initial capabilities which has yielded high retention with brokers and agents. We see further optionality to distribute more product and drive deeper engagement through these portals. We expect to make a great business even better. US Assure has a long and enviable track record of strong growth and robust margins, driven by high client retention, efficient distribution via its tech enabled online portal, as well as consistently profitable underwriting results for their capacity provider. We believe we can further enhance this business through our track record of productivity improvements, including expanded solutions, the addition of new brokers as well as product innovation. For many quarters we've discussed M&A as our top capital allocation priority and we've consistently noted that we only move forward with an acquisition when all our criteria for M&A are met. A deal must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. US Assure fits these criteria perfectly and aligns with our mission of providing innovative industry leading solutions for insurance brokers, agents and carriers. We will be acquiring US Assure for $1.075 billion, which represents approximately 12.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. There's also contingent consideration of up to $400 million. This transaction will be immediately accretive to adjusted EPS, which Jeremiah will further address shortly. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Miles to discuss the business in more detail. Miles?\nMiles Wuller: Thank you very much Pat. I want to echo Pat's comments on how excited we are to execute on our M&A strategy. Turning to Slide 4, Delegated Authority continues to be an enormous long-term opportunity and one of the core reasons for Ryan Specialty's founding. We have focused intently on building Ryan Specialty as a home where the best underwriters are empowered to innovate. We approached Delegated Authority through multiple avenues, each a touch point for Ryan Specialty to deliver value to carriers along the entire continuum of binding, programs and MGUs. Our Programs business targets niche industry verticals with a defined product set with typically smaller average premiums in our MGUs. This is the most significant enhancement to our Programs business since adding all risk national programs unit in 2020 and adds what we believe is one of the largest independent programs. We believe there's a long runway for consolidation and innovation in the Programs segment. With US Assure our underwriting management specialty will now make up 28% of Ryan Specialty's total revenue and coupled with Binding Authority takes Delegated Authority to 41%, highlighting the diversification of our platform. We will be larger, more diversified and better equipped to provide innovative industry leading solutions to our insurance brokers, agents and carriers.\nTy Petway: US Assure targets builders risk and construction projects in the SME market, specifically sub 50 million in hard costs, and writes on admitted paper provided by Zurich , with whom they've had a 44-year relationship. The business has an extremely valuable brand and is considered a first call for builder's risk in the SME segment as it is favored for its efficiency, responsiveness and targeted industry solutions. US Assure has a long track record of servicing over 20,000 existing brokerage relationships, many of whom will be new relationships to Ryan Specialty. We expect these additional relationships will drive significant new submission flow into our ecosystem. US Assure digitally services the majority of their policies through their highly efficient portal, a hallmark of their business for over 25 years. US Assure has delivered strong growth consistent with Ryan Specialty's target of double-digit organic growth. Underpinning its strong standalone revenue growth is their diversified product mix across residential and commercial construction as well as remodeling with a 50-state reach. Turning to Slide 6. As Pat outlined, this acquisition is a strategic fit for many reasons. First, US Assure adds connectivity with a broader set of SME focused retail brokers, where Ryan Specialty can drive deeper multifaceted relationships. They expand our total addressable market into the SME admitted segment and perfectly complement Ryan Specialty's existing builder's risk and construction capabilities, which tend to focus on larger projects on a non-admitted basis. The acquisition also expands our relationship with Zurich, a leading global insurer. Second, the acquisition deepens our capabilities in attractive markets. The construction industry has strong macro tailwinds given domestic housing dynamics and secular growth factors, such as the undersupply of homes, the age of national housing stock and new home inventories remaining modest by historical standards. Third is their unique distribution portal. Over the last 25 years, the team has developed an online portal with unmatched ease and efficiency. A fully automated quote, find and issuance system drives high client retention. Additionally, US Assure delivers to us valuable new product capabilities and further enhances our value proposition to clients and trading partners. US Assure has a significant knowledge of builder's risk insurance in the SME segment, which is highly valued by brokers and speaks that we are continuing to enhance our intellectual capital. And fourth, with a history of strong double digit growth, a diversified product mix with a 50-state reach, secular growth factors and our track record of productivity improvements, we are confident in the long-term growth of this business. This transaction will be immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. For the full year 2024, we expect US Assure to generate $123 million of revenue with a long-term sustainable margin in the mid-60s. Turning to Slide 7, US Assure is poised to thrive within our ecosystem. We see numerous levers to sustain and improve US Assure's growth. We believe we can further enhance this business through our track record of productivity improvements including expanded solutions, the addition of new brokers as well as product innovation. We believe there are substantial opportunities to find E&S solutions for existing submissions that were declined by the admitted market and believe our capabilities in placing difficult risks will bear fruit. We can leverage each firm's vast and complementary network by going deeper with key brokers and agents while working to develop the new retail broker relationships. We will drive more submission flow into US Assure as RT will find the best solutions for their retail clients. We also expect to develop new products and innovate on behalf of these SME builder's risk insureds. We see opportunities that partner with [indiscernible] existing construction MGU, technical risk underwriters in order to assist US Assure in implementing these incremental solutions for the SME segment. We have a long-standing track record of innovation and believe the construction industry has all the hallmarks we look for to develop successful Delegated Authority solutions. Given these levers, we expect double-digit growth moving forward and we are confident in the long-term growth of this business.

Furthering our Delegated Authority strategy, we're also pleased to announce a strategic relationship with MagMutual, a leader in the physicians and hospital professional liability segment of the healthcare market, where we will be joining our healthcare practices together. Our healthcare MGU Sapphire Blue will become MagMutual's exclusive underwriter for senior living and allied healthcare risks. The collective experience, expertise and brand recognition of our two organizations is unique in the healthcare liability marketplace. Together, we will expand our healthcare liability products and offerings to better serve our clients. Turning to another recent announcement, we are pleased to form an exclusive distribution partnership with Private Client Select or PCS, an MGU focused on high and ultrahigh net worth homeowners insurance, primarily owned by AIG and Stone Point. This exclusive distribution partnership with PCS will further enhance our national wholesale brokerage business and the superior service that Ryan Specialty provides to the high net worth focused retail brokers that we serve. PCS strategic use of E&S paper creates flexible solutions to address coverage gaps in the high and ultrahigh net worth homeowner segment of the residential market. We look forward to working closely with PCS and AIG to deliver new products and services to this highly coveted segment of the market. It has clearly been an exciting time for Ryan Specialty, particularly with the leadership succession plan previously announced that goes into effect October 1. Tim Turner will become our new CEO; Jeremiah Bickham will be promoted to President and Janice Hamilton will be promoted to Chief Financial Officer. I will assume the role of Executive Chairman. Success in planning is a matter that has been a top priority, both myself and the Board. We view attracting and developing top talent as a core competency and central to our long-term success. A thrill to promote from within, ensuring continuity with leaders who are ready for their new roles and are emblematic of the depth of talent if successfully cultivated. Tim has established himself as an insurance industry leader with an uncanny ability to foresee market trends. Since joining Ryan Specialty at its founding in 2010, he's been critical to our success, particularly in creating and developing RT specialty, and quickly led the business to become one of the top wholesale distributors of specialty insurance in the country. Tim has been integral in the development of Ryan Specialty over the years, having the vision to align RT specialty with the deep product set at Ryan Specialty Underwriting Managers. He has the support of our brokers, underwriters and the entire Ryan Specialty team. The Board and I are confident that he will be an excellent CEO. Jeremiah and Janice's promotions represent a seamless transition as these are well respected leaders who know our strategy and culture well. Jeremiah has shown outstanding leadership as well as financial and operational expertise since joining us in 2011. Janice, with over 20 years experience in the insurance industry, has proven her keen financial acumen and understanding of our business having rejoined our firm over six years ago. Her promotions are well deserved and reflect our commitment to developing talent within the organization. I look forward to partnering with them when I move into my new role as Executive Chairman and continue leading our Board of Directors. I will continue to play an active role on our executive team and will now be emphasizing the coach and player coach, which will further empower Tim, Jeremiah and Janice. Ryan Specialty is stronger than ever as evidenced by our outstanding first half, 2024, sustainable secular factors and our unique competitive position. The succession plan comes as we pass the three-year anniversary of our IPO, have clear positive momentum and a roster of world-class talent. This was the right time to put the pieces in place for our long-term success. Our new leadership team is more than ready to continue successfully delivering innovative solutions to our clients, generating industry leading organic growth, executing on our M&A strategy, increasing profitability and delivering additional value to our shareholders. Now I'm very pleased to turn the call over to Tim. Tim?\nTimothy Turner: Thank you very much Pat. I am honored to become CEO of this great firm in October and to lead our talented teams in delivering value for our clients, trading partners and shareholders. It has been a privilege to work alongside Pat and learn from his leadership since Ryan Specialty was founded. Pat is a true pioneer in the insurance industry. His commitment to innovation, execution and exceptional outcomes for clients and trading partners is unparalleled. Under Pat's leadership, Ryan Specialty has grown into an extraordinary company with a dynamic and differentiated business model. Looking ahead, we will continue to execute our strategy which remains unchanged. We will stay focused on delivering innovative solutions to our clients, generating industry leading organic growth, executing on our M&A strategy, increasing profitability and delivering additional value to our shareholders. I am pleased that Pat will remain regularly involved and will continue to be a valuable resource on the strategic direction of the firm. And along with the promotions of Jeremiah and Janice, we are in a position of strength to advance our strategy and drive long-term growth. Before diving into the quarter, I'd like to touch on the recent announcement of PCS selecting Ryan Specialty as their exclusive distribution partner. In response to the evolving needs of our clients, we are pleased to announce this innovative strategy which combines the strength and skills of PCS with the unique distribution capabilities and technical expertise of Ryan Specialty. We believe this initiative will increase the ability to handle more volume for both firms. AIG has a long history in the high and ultrahigh net worth segment along with a deep bench to be able to effectively service this select customer base. The blend of E&S and admitted products with a single carrier helps simplify the placement of these accounts, which have become increasingly difficult in recent years. Through this partnership, our vast network of retail brokers will be able to access the broad range of solutions from PCS. We are in a prime position to capture broader E&S tailwinds and further capitalize on the accelerated growth in the segment. Now moving to Q2, we had another excellent quarter of double-digit growth across our specialties, driven by an incredible team effort. Our wholesale brokerage specialty generated strong growth across property and casualty. In property we continue to see strong new business and high retentions as risks remain in the E&S channel. Given years of significant rate increases and no mega catastrophe event last year, underwriting appetite has picked up, taking rates off their peak as additional capacity enters the market. That said, the market continues to be impacted by elevated levels of attritional and secondary perils, including severe convective storms, which are off to another record year on top of a record high in 2023. Given higher retentions of risk and growing property exposures in both high value and catastrophe prone areas, any mega event could have a material impact on the property market. Our deep roster of talented professionals continues to successfully navigate this dynamic environment, finding the best solutions for our retail clients and winning market share from our competitors. We continue to believe property will be a strong contributor of growth for Ryan Specialty in 2024. Our casualty practice had another excellent quarter. The casualty market continues to experience an increasing number of classes faced higher loss costs. This is driving rate increases to accelerate and broaden out across industry classes. This trend is driven by many factors, notably an acceleration of social inflation marked by increased frequency, more prolonged legal cases, higher settlements, judgments and nuclear verdicts, all amplified by litigation finance. And ongoing impact of reserve changes on the 2015 through 2019 accident years, with growing recognition of reserve inadequacy for more recent years. Similar to the recent trend we saw in property, these factors are driving more casualty risks into the E&S market. E&S is better suited to handle a more uncertain loss environment as it offers significantly more freedom of rate and form and the ability for insurers and underwriters to adjust more quickly. We continue to see the E&S market respond well, yet with acute discipline and tight limit management. In this environment, it is critical for clients to receive specialized industry and product level knowledge and that is exactly where we excel. Thanks to our world-class team. We are confident that casualty will continue to be a strong driver of our 2024 growth. Overall, our wholesale brokerage specialty team remains committed to delivering innovative strategies and products to meet the ever changing needs of our clients. Now turning to our Delegated Authority Specialties, which include both Binding Authority and Underwriting Management. Our Binding Authority Specialty had another strong quarter, thanks to our top talent and new proprietary products that offer a seamless experience for clients who have small but tough to place commercial P&C risks. We continue to believe the consolidation of panels and binding authority remains a long-term growth opportunity and we are well positioned to capitalize. Our Underwriting Management Specialty had an excellent quarter led by property and casualty and transactional liability, as well as meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions. We are thrilled with today's announcement of US Assure which we expect will complement our capabilities in the specialty niche. Turning to price, while we continue to experience various micro cycles across insurance lines broadly, we continue to see two important trends. Property continues to see pricing moderation and stabilization after years of large increases and casualty is seeing price increases accelerating and broadening out across industry classes. Across both major industry classes, there remains heightened uncertainty in the loss environment. This is driving new risks into and risks to remain in the E&S marketplace. As we've noted consistently in any cycle, as certain lines are perceived to reach price adequacy, admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. However, this is still not playing out and the standard market has not meaningfully impacted rate or flow in the aggregate. We are well positioned to assist our trading partners in navigating this ever changing insurance landscape. We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our second quarter and more financial information on the US Assure acquisition. Thank you.\nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. Before diving into the quarterly results and acquisition details, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to become President of Ryan Specialty. I've dedicated the last nearly 13 years of my career to Ryan's specialty and I'm incredibly fortunate to have worked so closely with Pat, Tim, Miles and the entire team as we have built this exceptional firm. I would like to thank Pat for continuing to be a part of the executive team as a true player coach. My charge is to continue building on what Pat and Tim have created at Ryan Specialty, delivering innovative solutions to our clients, generating industry-leading organic growth, executing on our M&A strategy, increasing profitability and delivering additional value to our shareholders. I've worked closely with Janice for many years and I am thrilled that she will be taking over as CFO, come October 1. Her strong financial expertise and dynamic leadership will help us build on our proven strategy. Now turning to the quarter, total revenue grew 18.8% period-over-period to $695 million, fueled by another very strong quarter of organic growth at 14.2% and contributions from M&A which added nearly 5 percentage points to our top line. Growth was once again driven by very strong renewal retention, ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business. Adjusted EBITDAC grew 27.6% period-over-period to $248 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin improved 240 basis points to 35.6% driven by another quarter of strong revenue growth, savings from ACCELERATE 2025 and underlying margin improvement in our business. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.9% to $0.58 per share. Earlier today our Board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 payable later this month. Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program, we had approximately $8 million in charges for the quarter, bringing our total thus far to $85 million and we remain on track to achieve annual savings of approximately $60 million in 2025. We continue to expect that approximately half of these savings will be realized in 2024, with the majority of those savings falling to our bottom line. Those savings will be paired with underlying margin expansion in our business and we expect further underlying margin expansion in the years to come. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.1% for the quarter. Based on the current environment, we would expect a similar tax rate for the remainder of 2024. Turning to our acquisition of US Assure and Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation. As Pat, Tim and Miles have mentioned, we are very excited to announce this acquisition as it clearly fits within our long-term strategy and represents a meaningful boost to our Delegated Authority offering. We are acquiring 100% of the equity interest of US Assure for a base purchase price of $1.075 billion in cash, which represents 12.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. There is also contingent consideration of up to $400 million available if the company meets certain growth and profitability targets. Please note that this acquisition is an asset deal for tax purposes. We will be funding the upfront consideration of the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from newly issued debt. We very recently upsized our revolving credit facility to $1.4 billion and executed a $500 million 364-day bridge facility which we intend to replace with proceeds from a syndicated market transaction in Q3. Importantly, following the close of this transaction, we expect no change in our financial policy, including our leverage comfort corridor of 3 to 4 times total net leverage, and expect our credit ratings to remain consistent. Assuming the transaction and debt raise are completed by 09/01 we expect GAAP interest expense, excluding the amortization of deferred issuance cost of approximately $35 million in Q3 and approximately $46 million in Q4. These estimates are based on our current assessment of market conditions and subject to the terms we achieve under our upcoming debt offering. The US Assure transaction is expected to be immediately accretive. We expect adjusted EPS accretion of approximately $0.01 to $0.02 from September through December and approximately $0.06 in year one. Turning to guidance, we are now guiding our organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2024 to be between 13.0% and 14.0%, which reflects an increase of 50 basis points to the floor compared to our previous guide range of 12.5% to 14.0%. Assuming the US Assure transaction is completed on 09/01, we are guiding to a full year adjusted EBITDAC margin between 32.0% and 32.5%, up from our prior guide range of 31.0% to 31.5%. In summary, it is a very exciting time at Ryan Specialty. We continue to perform at a very high level. We once again grew market share in several of our businesses while continuing to invest in our platform and we executed on significant M&A that will strengthen our organic growth engine for years to come. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest organically in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth. We will continue to execute on our disciplined M&A strategy with high quality acquisitions and we will maintain our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which should create long-term sustainable value for shareholders. Our dynamic and differentiated business model continues to position us well to serve our clients and deliver innovative solutions that our clients have come to expect as a hallmark of Ryan Specialty. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi thanks, good evening. My first question is on, I guess, the margin guidance, is the upside solely from the transaction? And then would this, I guess this would be the new baseline that we want to think about margin improvement for, when we're thinking about 2025?\nPatrick Ryan: Hi Elise. We haven't given an updated margin guidance with and without US Assure, but to clarify, the new margin guidance does include US Assure and the significant uptick in large is almost entirely due to US Assure.\nElyse Greenspan: And then it would be the right baseline when thinking about 2025 because there's not like any -- you'll just assuming you complete the deal at the start of September and then we can just think about a normal level of margin expansion off of that base?\nPatrick Ryan: Yes, there's nothing -- there's not a nonrecurring element to how we'll finish 2024 and when we update guidance for 2025 early next year, it will be off this as a baseline. Yes.\nElyse Greenspan: And then on the organic growth, you guys did see some sequential acceleration about 50 basis points in the quarter. I thought Q2, you guys, like the industry skew a bit more towards property, which it sounds like from your comments, rates are decelerating. So did you see perhaps within the numbers, a slowdown in property growth offset by strong organic growth within casualty or what led, I guess, can we get some more color on what led to the sequential acceleration within organic revenue growth?\nPatrick Ryan: Yes, so there are a couple of pieces to that. I'll answer it from a numbers perspective and Q2 and maybe a little bit beyond that and then maybe toss it over to Tim to talk about the market dynamics underpinning that. So first off, property was an extremely strong contributor in Q2 and H1 overall. And as a reminder, Q2 is our highest percentage of property from a seasonality perspective, so it was a really tough comp. And as Tim mentioned, there has been some rate moderation and even in some cases deceleration. That being said, because the flow of business into E&S is still healthy and because our team presents unique solutions and products, we were able to produce very solid double-digit growth from our property portfolio. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we believe property will be a strong contributor to growth for the remainder of the year. Tim, you want to add to that?\nTimothy Turner: I would just add that the property market remains overall very firm. Even with the modest rate decelerations that we're seeing our flow of new business is double-digit. We're capturing new business. We're retaining our book at a high level and we have a very strong heavy windstorm season ahead as well as wildfire season throughout the summer. So we remain very bullish in the property segment.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my last question, I guess is on the agreement. You guys were talking about with AIG. How big of an opportunity is this for you guys? And is there some level of revenue from this relationship embedded within your new organic revenue growth guidance?\nPatrick Ryan: I'll take that last part and then kick it back to Tim. Elyse, there is no revenue either in Q2 or embedded in the guidance. It's all upside and it is a very exciting opportunity which Tim, take it away.\nTimothy Turner: High net worth has increasingly become an E&S product line and we've developed broker expertise, very technical underwriting expertise, and we've been able to strike this key exclusive with PCS and AIG. We're excited about it. The market demands for our services and product line are increasing every day and we know that we can add tremendous value for our customer base.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Grace Carter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nGrace Carter: Hi everyone. Looking at the US Assure deal, I was hoping you all could help us out on if there's any notable seasonality in the revenue or in the margins that we should be thinking about as we are looking at the modeling for this.\nMiles Wuller: Hi, this is Miles. We appreciate the question, and no, there is not noticeable seasonality as indicated in the release. This is a substantial amount of enforced policies, approximately 150,000. These are small tickets taking place over the course of the year.\nPatrick Ryan: And embedded in that question I know you referenced PC and you're probably looking at the back of the deck and seeing the different numbers, there is look less predictability like PC are harder to model than our base fees and commission. But US Assure has a 44-year relationship with Zurich, a really long history of delivering profitable underwriting results. And there is significant carrier profitability represented by the estimated 2024 PC figure in the deck. And we fully expect US Assure to continue delivering exceptional underwriting results for Zurich going forward.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And I guess moving back to your standalone book, just given kind of all of the noise in the casualty market these days, I was wondering if there's any impact on how you're thinking about the outlook for contingents in your business or if you expect things to continue to perform pretty much in line with how they have been in the past several quarters. Thank you.\nPatrick Ryan: Yes, thank you. So we're proud that we spotted the need for rate in casualty several years ago. We've been introducing it broadly across our product set. We think we've been delivered product to our carriers, particularly over the most recent parts of the cycle. And so we do expect continued attractive profit commissions from the business we've placed.\nGrace Carter: Thanks. And just one more if I can, just kind of given the freedom of rate and form in the non-admitted market, and what you referenced about just how firm the rates have been in casualty in the non-admitted market for a while. I mean, would it be reasonable to assume that there would be less reserving concerns on the non-admitted casualty side, relative to the admitted casualty side? Just kind of given that the assumption that some of these accounts would be more challenging in the first place and that would be taken into account during the initial underwriting process.\nPatrick Ryan: I think it's becoming widely known that the loss cost adjustment factors on long tail high hazard casualty business are accelerating at such a high rate that while we know the 2015 to 2019 accident years were grossly under reserved. Well, the industry is questioning the reserves in 2021 and 2022. And there's a lot of discussion about rate adequacy in those years as well. So rates continue to go up. Casualty in the high hazard segments that we specialize in, continue to firm, and our services are in high demand.\nGrace Carter: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Cox: Hey guys, congrats everyone on the new roles.\nPatrick Ryan: Thank you, Rob.\nRobert Cox: I just wanted to start with question on US Assure. So when you say the margin is in the mid-60s, I just want to confirm that that's adjusted EBITDAC margin. And could you just walk us through how the margin is sustainably that high, just given that's materially higher than some of the other programs that we've seen? And then just, yes how about I stop there.\nJeremiah Bickham: Confirmed that that is the adjusted EBITDAC margin that we believe is very sustainable long-term in the mid-60s. As to why, there's a couple reasons, and I'll let Pat take those.\nTimothy Turner: I think the biggest reasons are that they have been in this business space for 44 years. They have a highly efficient distribution system and operating cost structure. This is a very high value product to small contractors. And as you know, people require insurance when they hire a contractor and these are very low average premiums. They're micro premiums. A lot of people would say you can't make a profit on this sized premium. The US Assure team several decades ago figured out how to do that. And so it's a very high value proposition to the contractor, and they have a very long-term sustainable, high profit result with the Zurich. You'll see in the deck that we just renewed or extended, I should say, a 10-year contract with US Assure and Zurich to solidify the long-term. It's very unusual to have a very long-term contract on Delegated Authority. Often they're a year at a time and sometimes less. So Zurich is so committed to this that they wanted a fresh start with us and we did with them, to have a 10-year contract. So this is a very efficient value add to contractors, which helps people that are remodeling their homes or building new homes, and they're very tough competitors. And also, Rob, the numbers that you're looking at in the deck are not adjusted on the trailing 12 basis. Those are reported. So to get to the mid60s, there's not heroic assumptions. As Pat said, it's a highly efficient, tech enabled platform. The majority of their policies don't even require a human touch before they're bound. And then of course, profit commissions are really high margin revenue. So we're very confident that that margin range is sustainable.\nRobert Cox: Okay. And on that point, I mean, the profit commissions are about, I think in the 2024 year projection, 16% of the total revenue. Is that a solid normal run rate going forward?\nTimothy Turner: It's not 60% of total revenue. It's going to be a high amount of revenue in Q4 because profit commissions are sometimes booked unevenly. If you look at the 2024 e-number and you get the 20 part of 123 is a little bit more representative. But again, those can go up and down. What we're confident in is because US Assure has such a consistent, disciplined underwriting approach and they've turned out profits for so many years, the number again will be a little bit harder to forecast than base commission and fees, but it's going to be consistent and over the long-term that number is going to go up.\nRobert Cox: Okay, got it. And may be just lastly, on the organic growth profile of Assure, historically, I know you guys mentioned the total revenue growth was double-digit, but is the organic growth profile also that high?\nTimothy Turner: Yes. Yes it is. And we think that there's upside to that on our platform. During the first year that we own a company, there's a little bit of a ramp up that occurs during integration. But long-term and in short order, we think US Assure returns to its historically, what's been double-digit plus organic growth profile. And on our platform, because we've got a long track record of making great businesses even better, there's upside to their growth profile.\nJeremiah Bickham: As you know, we increased, I'm sorry. Go ahead.\nRobert Cox: All right. No, no, you go ahead.\nJeremiah Bickham: Okay. We have a history with our acquisitions, as you know, of really helping them to improve productivity, and that's been representative in just about every acquisition we've done. And we expect that to be a significant opportunity to help lift their traditional organic rates of growth, because we can get them into more brokers. We will have the ability to place business that Zurich doesn't have the appetite for, but we cannot take those from the admitted market, but the declination by Zurich and two others, two other admitted carriers, we can then produce those in the E&S market for them. So instead of just having that business fall out, there's an opportunity to put them into the market that they belong in. Additionally, the online portal has significant opportunities to expand, something that we've been working very hard on for a long time, and that is electronic trading products. And this group has started out in 1997. It's very early in terms of electronic trading, so they're quite proficient at it. So we believe that working together with them will expand opportunities for electronic trading. And as you know, binding business is really principally SME. So we have a very strong SME market share. As you've seen, our contract binding business grows very rapidly. This adds to that very significantly. So it's been a strategy for our firm since 2015 to expand into what we call our spokes strategy into smaller cities, not small towns, but cities that are not the urban hubs and right small commercial, and we've been moving that into electronic trading. So this fills our SME strategy. This enhances our electronic trading strategy. And so the strategic rationale for this is as fulsome as we could have anticipated.\nRobert Cox: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks so much and good afternoon, everyone. I'm hoping to understand how US Assure's portal interacts with the connector that you had talked about as Ryan's sort of automated portal for [indiscernible]?\nJeremiah Bickham: Well Meyer, presently they are independent, but RT will have expanded access to the US Assure portal. Currently, it's a relatively limited appointment basis that will be opened up. As Pat touched on, we expect the addition of incremental flow from RT and incremental flow from Ryan aligned retailers to the incremental submissions into the platform. So they're independent today. It is possible within the future that we could offer a quote on US Assure through the connector or they can come direct to the US Assure portal.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. Second question. Just looking at the forecast, it seems like expected profit commissions, more than half come in the fourth quarter. I assume that means that it's 2024 experience that drives US Assure's profit commissions. Am I thinking about that correctly?\nJeremiah Bickham: Meyer, they are on a, they earned over three years on average. So anything collected this year is the result of 24 to 36 months ago. I want to reiterate what some of my colleagues said. This is a book of substantial policy count, typically lower limit business than a lot of the other Delegated Authority in our family. There is not material cat exposure and therefore the team feels good about the projections within the book, that we are expecting it later in the year.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, thanks. Okay, lots of exciting things going on. First question on the margins this quarter on expenses. The margins were, I think, meaningfully healthier, you could say, than expected. It doesn't look like it was driven by contingents or subs. Anything you'd want to mention there?\nPatrick Ryan: Well, as we said, we were going to resume underlying margin expansion in the business, so that's a factor, the continued impact of ACCELERATE 2025 is in there. But remember, seasonally Q2 is our biggest quarter. So it's got the highest dollar amount of revenue and margin will follow revenue seasonality to a degree. So it follows that this would be a very high margin quarter. But we're also thrilled to see our efforts represented through underlying margin expansion and ACCELERATE 2025 borne out in the numbers.\nMike Zaremski: Moving to M&A and the acquisition, I guess doing it quickly looks like your leverage levels will be meaningfully higher. Should we be -- remind us what your comfort level is on the leverage levels. Then we can figure out whether we should kind of resell future M&A.\nPatrick Ryan: Definitely don't do that last part. So we've been storing up dry powder for just an opportunity like this. So we've had pretty low leverage far below our comfort corridor. We will be -- we anticipate just contemplating closing US Assure that our high point leverage certificate will be something with like a very low three times right around the three, three to three and a quarter total net leverage. But our comfort corridor and where we expect to spend a lot of time while we're highly acquisitive, is the three to four times net leverage. So we still have a lot of room to run, which is great because the cupboard is not bare when it comes to M&A.\nMike Zaremski: Got it. Okay. And lastly, the answer is probably just goodwill. Maybe I'm missing something, but the EPS accretion is very low single digits relative. You know, relatively we know what the EBITDA accretion will be much higher. Is that -- just what's going on there?\nTimothy Turner: Succinctly look, there is just not a lot of heroic assumptions in there. But just back up for a second. We've done nearly 60 acquisitions, and as Pat said, we've got a really high batting average at making great businesses even better. And we're confident that we will enhance this already high performing platform and that it will be a bull's eye strategic fit for us. As I mentioned, there is a ramp up period during the first 12 months of ownership while we're integrating the business. So, for example, our EPS estimates in our first year of ownership do not include any revenue synergies. However, as we said earlier, we are very confident that US Assure can grow as it has historically in the double-digit range and sustain the mid-60s margin. So while we're being prudent in how we're talking about first year EPS, which obviously includes higher interest expense because of the marginal debt we're raising, a business like this with this financial profile, along with their consistent profitable underwriting discipline is not only accretive to EPS, but also our brand and our overall platform.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, congrats. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks to you. First one just making sure, what is the economic sensitivity of the business? In what sense, how is it sensitive to maybe inflation as well?\nJeremiah Bickham: Yes, well, thank you for that. We want to emphasize that US Assure has been exceptional double-digit grower throughout the cycle. Certainly over the last 18 months, higher interest rates have put pressure on housing starts. They've grown throughout that pressure. We want to highlight, and it also doesn't change the macro addressable opportunity. So the US has a structural housing shortfall of over 2 million units. The vacancy levels in new and used homes are at multi-decade lows. We have an aging housing stock in the US. And so looking ahead, interest rates are in fact poised to subside. Building materials and inflationary pressures are now down to pre-COVID levels, at least on building material costs. And so our view is this, this business has been capturing the opportunity and is poised to really move ahead over the coming years.\nBrian Meredith:\nCrowdStrike:\nTimothy Turner:\nCrowdStrike: However, we absolutely think it'll affirm current levels. It will inspire incremental buyers. And perhaps more importantly, the event is a reminder of how dependent we are becoming on web based delivery as an economy. It's really incomprehensible how many companies still remain underinsured. So we do. There might not be immediate changes in pricing. There will be changes in buying habit.\nBrian Meredith: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like there are no further questions. Therefore, I'll turn the call back over to Pat Ryan for closing comments.\nPatrick Ryan: Thank you very much. Great questions. Thanks for the opportunity to answer those questions, very proud of how our team performed, very proud of how the company, the firm has performed over the first six months. We thank you all for your support. We look forward to speaking to you in the near future. Have a good evening.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your line at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Hamilton: Our second quarter continued our strong momentum, excellent top and bottom line results, reflecting our formidable value proposition, differentiated talent and niche specialization. Total revenue grew 18.8% year-over-year to $695 million, driven by organic growth of 14.2% on top of the strong growth we posted in the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDAC grew 27.6% to $248 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 240 basis points to 35.6%, driven by another quarter of strong revenue growth, savings from ACCELERATE 2025 and underlying margin improvement in our business. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.9% to $0.58 per share. Now turning to Slide 3 of our supplemental presentation. Today we announced an agreement to acquire US Assure, a leading program focused exclusively on builder's risk insurance. We're excited about this transaction for several reasons. We're significantly expanding Ryan Specialty's broker relationships and total addressable market. US Assure meaningfully increases our footprint in the Programs segment of Delegated Underwriting Authority. We're pleased to be executing on our M&A focus in this area as we see it as ripe for consolidation. We are deepening our capabilities in attractive markets. We will enhance our capability in the attractive SME segment of the builders risk and construction market, which more broadly is a major and fast growing component of U.S. GDP. We are adding a strong and valuable solution set. Having placed business online for over 25 years, US Assure's distribution portal is a unique asset offering an efficient and cost effective tool that provides a one-stop solution accessed by over 20,000 retailers. This innovative offering provides fully automated, rapid and seamless quote, find initial capabilities which has yielded high retention with brokers and agents. We see further optionality to distribute more product and drive deeper engagement through these portals. We expect to make a great business even better. US Assure has a long and enviable track record of strong growth and robust margins, driven by high client retention, efficient distribution via its tech enabled online portal, as well as consistently profitable underwriting results for their capacity provider. We believe we can further enhance this business through our track record of productivity improvements, including expanded solutions, the addition of new brokers as well as product innovation. For many quarters we've discussed M&A as our top capital allocation priority and we've consistently noted that we only move forward with an acquisition when all our criteria for M&A are met. A deal must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive. US Assure fits these criteria perfectly and aligns with our mission of providing innovative industry leading solutions for insurance brokers, agents and carriers. We will be acquiring US Assure for $1.075 billion, which represents approximately 12.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. There's also contingent consideration of up to $400 million. This transaction will be immediately accretive to adjusted EPS, which Jeremiah will further address shortly. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Miles to discuss the business in more detail. Miles? Thank you, Miles. Furthering our Delegated Authority strategy, we're also pleased to announce a strategic relationship with MagMutual, a leader in the physicians and hospital professional liability segment of the healthcare market, where we will be joining our healthcare practices together. Our healthcare MGU Sapphire Blue will become MagMutual's exclusive underwriter for senior living and allied healthcare risks. The collective experience, expertise and brand recognition of our two organizations is unique in the healthcare liability marketplace. Together, we will expand our healthcare liability products and offerings to better serve our clients. Turning to another recent announcement, we are pleased to form an exclusive distribution partnership with Private Client Select or PCS, an MGU focused on high and ultrahigh net worth homeowners insurance, primarily owned by AIG and Stone Point. This exclusive distribution partnership with PCS will further enhance our national wholesale brokerage business and the superior service that Ryan Specialty provides to the high net worth focused retail brokers that we serve. PCS strategic use of E&S paper creates flexible solutions to address coverage gaps in the high and ultrahigh net worth homeowner segment of the residential market. We look forward to working closely with PCS and AIG to deliver new products and services to this highly coveted segment of the market. It has clearly been an exciting time for Ryan Specialty, particularly with the leadership succession plan previously announced that goes into effect October 1. Tim Turner will become our new CEO; Jeremiah Bickham will be promoted to President and Janice Hamilton will be promoted to Chief Financial Officer. I will assume the role of Executive Chairman. Success in planning is a matter that has been a top priority, both myself and the Board. We view attracting and developing top talent as a core competency and central to our long-term success. A thrill to promote from within, ensuring continuity with leaders who are ready for their new roles and are emblematic of the depth of talent if successfully cultivated. Tim has established himself as an insurance industry leader with an uncanny ability to foresee market trends. Since joining Ryan Specialty at its founding in 2010, he's been critical to our success, particularly in creating and developing RT specialty, and quickly led the business to become one of the top wholesale distributors of specialty insurance in the country. Tim has been integral in the development of Ryan Specialty over the years, having the vision to align RT specialty with the deep product set at Ryan Specialty Underwriting Managers. He has the support of our brokers, underwriters and the entire Ryan Specialty team. The Board and I are confident that he will be an excellent CEO. Jeremiah and Janice's promotions represent a seamless transition as these are well respected leaders who know our strategy and culture well. Jeremiah has shown outstanding leadership as well as financial and operational expertise since joining us in 2011. Janice, with over 20 years experience in the insurance industry, has proven her keen financial acumen and understanding of our business having rejoined our firm over six years ago. Her promotions are well deserved and reflect our commitment to developing talent within the organization. I look forward to partnering with them when I move into my new role as Executive Chairman and continue leading our Board of Directors. I will continue to play an active role on our executive team and will now be emphasizing the coach and player coach, which will further empower Tim, Jeremiah and Janice. Ryan Specialty is stronger than ever as evidenced by our outstanding first half, 2024, sustainable secular factors and our unique competitive position. The succession plan comes as we pass the three-year anniversary of our IPO, have clear positive momentum and a roster of world-class talent. This was the right time to put the pieces in place for our long-term success. Our new leadership team is more than ready to continue successfully delivering innovative solutions to our clients, generating industry leading organic growth, executing on our M&A strategy, increasing profitability and delivering additional value to our shareholders. Now I'm very pleased to turn the call over to Tim. Tim? Hi Elise. We haven't given an updated margin guidance with and without US Assure, but to clarify, the new margin guidance does include US Assure and the significant uptick in large is almost entirely due to US Assure. Yes, there's nothing -- there's not a nonrecurring element to how we'll finish 2024 and when we update guidance for 2025 early next year, it will be off this as a baseline. Yes. Yes, so there are a couple of pieces to that. I'll answer it from a numbers perspective and Q2 and maybe a little bit beyond that and then maybe toss it over to Tim to talk about the market dynamics underpinning that. So first off, property was an extremely strong contributor in Q2 and H1 overall. And as a reminder, Q2 is our highest percentage of property from a seasonality perspective, so it was a really tough comp. And as Tim mentioned, there has been some rate moderation and even in some cases deceleration. That being said, because the flow of business into E&S is still healthy and because our team presents unique solutions and products, we were able to produce very solid double-digit growth from our property portfolio. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we believe property will be a strong contributor to growth for the remainder of the year. Tim, you want to add to that? I'll take that last part and then kick it back to Tim. Elyse, there is no revenue either in Q2 or embedded in the guidance. It's all upside and it is a very exciting opportunity which Tim, take it away. And embedded in that question I know you referenced PC and you're probably looking at the back of the deck and seeing the different numbers, there is look less predictability like PC are harder to model than our base fees and commission. But US Assure has a 44-year relationship with Zurich, a really long history of delivering profitable underwriting results. And there is significant carrier profitability represented by the estimated 2024 PC figure in the deck. And we fully expect US Assure to continue delivering exceptional underwriting results for Zurich going forward. Yes, thank you. So we're proud that we spotted the need for rate in casualty several years ago. We've been introducing it broadly across our product set. We think we've been delivered product to our carriers, particularly over the most recent parts of the cycle. And so we do expect continued attractive profit commissions from the business we've placed. I think it's becoming widely known that the loss cost adjustment factors on long tail high hazard casualty business are accelerating at such a high rate that while we know the 2015 to 2019 accident years were grossly under reserved. Well, the industry is questioning the reserves in 2021 and 2022. And there's a lot of discussion about rate adequacy in those years as well. So rates continue to go up. Casualty in the high hazard segments that we specialize in, continue to firm, and our services are in high demand. Thank you, Rob. Well, as we said, we were going to resume underlying margin expansion in the business, so that's a factor, the continued impact of ACCELERATE 2025 is in there. But remember, seasonally Q2 is our biggest quarter. So it's got the highest dollar amount of revenue and margin will follow revenue seasonality to a degree. So it follows that this would be a very high margin quarter. But we're also thrilled to see our efforts represented through underlying margin expansion and ACCELERATE 2025 borne out in the numbers. Definitely don't do that last part. So we've been storing up dry powder for just an opportunity like this. So we've had pretty low leverage far below our comfort corridor. We will be -- we anticipate just contemplating closing US Assure that our high point leverage certificate will be something with like a very low three times right around the three, three to three and a quarter total net leverage. But our comfort corridor and where we expect to spend a lot of time while we're highly acquisitive, is the three to four times net leverage. So we still have a lot of room to run, which is great because the cupboard is not bare when it comes to M&A. Thank you very much. Great questions. Thanks for the opportunity to answer those questions, very proud of how our team performed, very proud of how the company, the firm has performed over the first six months. We thank you all for your support. We look forward to speaking to you in the near future. Have a good evening."

            "content": "US Assure targets builders risk and construction projects in the SME market, specifically sub 50 million in hard costs, and writes on admitted paper provided by Zurich , with whom they've had a 44-year relationship. The business has an extremely valuable brand and is considered a first call for builder's risk in the SME segment as it is favored for its efficiency, responsiveness and targeted industry solutions. US Assure has a long track record of servicing over 20,000 existing brokerage relationships, many of whom will be new relationships to Ryan Specialty. We expect these additional relationships will drive significant new submission flow into our ecosystem. US Assure digitally services the majority of their policies through their highly efficient portal, a hallmark of their business for over 25 years. US Assure has delivered strong growth consistent with Ryan Specialty's target of double-digit organic growth. Underpinning its strong standalone revenue growth is their diversified product mix across residential and commercial construction as well as remodeling with a 50-state reach. Turning to Slide 6. As Pat outlined, this acquisition is a strategic fit for many reasons. First, US Assure adds connectivity with a broader set of SME focused retail brokers, where Ryan Specialty can drive deeper multifaceted relationships. They expand our total addressable market into the SME admitted segment and perfectly complement Ryan Specialty's existing builder's risk and construction capabilities, which tend to focus on larger projects on a non-admitted basis. The acquisition also expands our relationship with Zurich, a leading global insurer. Second, the acquisition deepens our capabilities in attractive markets. The construction industry has strong macro tailwinds given domestic housing dynamics and secular growth factors, such as the undersupply of homes, the age of national housing stock and new home inventories remaining modest by historical standards. Third is their unique distribution portal. Over the last 25 years, the team has developed an online portal with unmatched ease and efficiency. A fully automated quote, find and issuance system drives high client retention. Additionally, US Assure delivers to us valuable new product capabilities and further enhances our value proposition to clients and trading partners. US Assure has a significant knowledge of builder's risk insurance in the SME segment, which is highly valued by brokers and speaks that we are continuing to enhance our intellectual capital. And fourth, with a history of strong double digit growth, a diversified product mix with a 50-state reach, secular growth factors and our track record of productivity improvements, we are confident in the long-term growth of this business. This transaction will be immediately accretive to adjusted EPS. For the full year 2024, we expect US Assure to generate $123 million of revenue with a long-term sustainable margin in the mid-60s. Turning to Slide 7, US Assure is poised to thrive within our ecosystem. We see numerous levers to sustain and improve US Assure's growth. We believe we can further enhance this business through our track record of productivity improvements including expanded solutions, the addition of new brokers as well as product innovation. We believe there are substantial opportunities to find E&S solutions for existing submissions that were declined by the admitted market and believe our capabilities in placing difficult risks will bear fruit. We can leverage each firm's vast and complementary network by going deeper with key brokers and agents while working to develop the new retail broker relationships. We will drive more submission flow into US Assure as RT will find the best solutions for their retail clients. We also expect to develop new products and innovate on behalf of these SME builder's risk insureds. We see opportunities that partner with [indiscernible] existing construction MGU, technical risk underwriters in order to assist US Assure in implementing these incremental solutions for the SME segment. We have a long-standing track record of innovation and believe the construction industry has all the hallmarks we look for to develop successful Delegated Authority solutions. Given these levers, we expect double-digit growth moving forward and we are confident in the long-term growth of this business. With that, I'll turn it back to Patient."

            "name": "Timothy Turner",
            "content": "Thank you very much Pat. I am honored to become CEO of this great firm in October and to lead our talented teams in delivering value for our clients, trading partners and shareholders. It has been a privilege to work alongside Pat and learn from his leadership since Ryan Specialty was founded. Pat is a true pioneer in the insurance industry. His commitment to innovation, execution and exceptional outcomes for clients and trading partners is unparalleled. Under Pat's leadership, Ryan Specialty has grown into an extraordinary company with a dynamic and differentiated business model. Looking ahead, we will continue to execute our strategy which remains unchanged. We will stay focused on delivering innovative solutions to our clients, generating industry leading organic growth, executing on our M&A strategy, increasing profitability and delivering additional value to our shareholders. I am pleased that Pat will remain regularly involved and will continue to be a valuable resource on the strategic direction of the firm. And along with the promotions of Jeremiah and Janice, we are in a position of strength to advance our strategy and drive long-term growth. Before diving into the quarter, I'd like to touch on the recent announcement of PCS selecting Ryan Specialty as their exclusive distribution partner. In response to the evolving needs of our clients, we are pleased to announce this innovative strategy which combines the strength and skills of PCS with the unique distribution capabilities and technical expertise of Ryan Specialty. We believe this initiative will increase the ability to handle more volume for both firms. AIG has a long history in the high and ultrahigh net worth segment along with a deep bench to be able to effectively service this select customer base. The blend of E&S and admitted products with a single carrier helps simplify the placement of these accounts, which have become increasingly difficult in recent years. Through this partnership, our vast network of retail brokers will be able to access the broad range of solutions from PCS. We are in a prime position to capture broader E&S tailwinds and further capitalize on the accelerated growth in the segment. Now moving to Q2, we had another excellent quarter of double-digit growth across our specialties, driven by an incredible team effort. Our wholesale brokerage specialty generated strong growth across property and casualty. In property we continue to see strong new business and high retentions as risks remain in the E&S channel. Given years of significant rate increases and no mega catastrophe event last year, underwriting appetite has picked up, taking rates off their peak as additional capacity enters the market. That said, the market continues to be impacted by elevated levels of attritional and secondary perils, including severe convective storms, which are off to another record year on top of a record high in 2023. Given higher retentions of risk and growing property exposures in both high value and catastrophe prone areas, any mega event could have a material impact on the property market. Our deep roster of talented professionals continues to successfully navigate this dynamic environment, finding the best solutions for our retail clients and winning market share from our competitors. We continue to believe property will be a strong contributor of growth for Ryan Specialty in 2024. Our casualty practice had another excellent quarter. The casualty market continues to experience an increasing number of classes faced higher loss costs. This is driving rate increases to accelerate and broaden out across industry classes. This trend is driven by many factors, notably an acceleration of social inflation marked by increased frequency, more prolonged legal cases, higher settlements, judgments and nuclear verdicts, all amplified by litigation finance. And ongoing impact of reserve changes on the 2015 through 2019 accident years, with growing recognition of reserve inadequacy for more recent years. Similar to the recent trend we saw in property, these factors are driving more casualty risks into the E&S market. E&S is better suited to handle a more uncertain loss environment as it offers significantly more freedom of rate and form and the ability for insurers and underwriters to adjust more quickly. We continue to see the E&S market respond well, yet with acute discipline and tight limit management. In this environment, it is critical for clients to receive specialized industry and product level knowledge and that is exactly where we excel. Thanks to our world-class team. We are confident that casualty will continue to be a strong driver of our 2024 growth. Overall, our wholesale brokerage specialty team remains committed to delivering innovative strategies and products to meet the ever changing needs of our clients. Now turning to our Delegated Authority Specialties, which include both Binding Authority and Underwriting Management. Our Binding Authority Specialty had another strong quarter, thanks to our top talent and new proprietary products that offer a seamless experience for clients who have small but tough to place commercial P&C risks. We continue to believe the consolidation of panels and binding authority remains a long-term growth opportunity and we are well positioned to capitalize. Our Underwriting Management Specialty had an excellent quarter led by property and casualty and transactional liability, as well as meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions. We are thrilled with today's announcement of US Assure which we expect will complement our capabilities in the specialty niche. Turning to price, while we continue to experience various micro cycles across insurance lines broadly, we continue to see two important trends. Property continues to see pricing moderation and stabilization after years of large increases and casualty is seeing price increases accelerating and broadening out across industry classes. Across both major industry classes, there remains heightened uncertainty in the loss environment. This is driving new risks into and risks to remain in the E&S marketplace. As we've noted consistently in any cycle, as certain lines are perceived to reach price adequacy, admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. However, this is still not playing out and the standard market has not meaningfully impacted rate or flow in the aggregate. We are well positioned to assist our trading partners in navigating this ever changing insurance landscape. We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialty's growth, more so than rate. With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our second quarter and more financial information on the US Assure acquisition. Thank you. I would just add that the property market remains overall very firm. Even with the modest rate decelerations that we're seeing our flow of new business is double-digit. We're capturing new business. We're retaining our book at a high level and we have a very strong heavy windstorm season ahead as well as wildfire season throughout the summer. So we remain very bullish in the property segment. High net worth has increasingly become an E&S product line and we've developed broker expertise, very technical underwriting expertise, and we've been able to strike this key exclusive with PCS and AIG. We're excited about it. The market demands for our services and product line are increasing every day and we know that we can add tremendous value for our customer base. I think the biggest reasons are that they have been in this business space for 44 years. They have a highly efficient distribution system and operating cost structure. This is a very high value product to small contractors. And as you know, people require insurance when they hire a contractor and these are very low average premiums. They're micro premiums. A lot of people would say you can't make a profit on this sized premium. The US Assure team several decades ago figured out how to do that. And so it's a very high value proposition to the contractor, and they have a very long-term sustainable, high profit result with the Zurich. You'll see in the deck that we just renewed or extended, I should say, a 10-year contract with US Assure and Zurich to solidify the long-term. It's very unusual to have a very long-term contract on Delegated Authority. Often they're a year at a time and sometimes less. So Zurich is so committed to this that they wanted a fresh start with us and we did with them, to have a 10-year contract. So this is a very efficient value add to contractors, which helps people that are remodeling their homes or building new homes, and they're very tough competitors. And also, Rob, the numbers that you're looking at in the deck are not adjusted on the trailing 12 basis. Those are reported. So to get to the mid60s, there's not heroic assumptions. As Pat said, it's a highly efficient, tech enabled platform. The majority of their policies don't even require a human touch before they're bound. And then of course, profit commissions are really high margin revenue. So we're very confident that that margin range is sustainable. It's not 60% of total revenue. It's going to be a high amount of revenue in Q4 because profit commissions are sometimes booked unevenly. If you look at the 2024 e-number and you get the 20 part of 123 is a little bit more representative. But again, those can go up and down. What we're confident in is because US Assure has such a consistent, disciplined underwriting approach and they've turned out profits for so many years, the number again will be a little bit harder to forecast than base commission and fees, but it's going to be consistent and over the long-term that number is going to go up. Yes. Yes it is. And we think that there's upside to that on our platform. During the first year that we own a company, there's a little bit of a ramp up that occurs during integration. But long-term and in short order, we think US Assure returns to its historically, what's been double-digit plus organic growth profile. And on our platform, because we've got a long track record of making great businesses even better, there's upside to their growth profile. Succinctly look, there is just not a lot of heroic assumptions in there. But just back up for a second. We've done nearly 60 acquisitions, and as Pat said, we've got a really high batting average at making great businesses even better. And we're confident that we will enhance this already high performing platform and that it will be a bull's eye strategic fit for us. As I mentioned, there is a ramp up period during the first 12 months of ownership while we're integrating the business. So, for example, our EPS estimates in our first year of ownership do not include any revenue synergies. However, as we said earlier, we are very confident that US Assure can grow as it has historically in the double-digit range and sustain the mid-60s margin. So while we're being prudent in how we're talking about first year EPS, which obviously includes higher interest expense because of the marginal debt we're raising, a business like this with this financial profile, along with their consistent profitable underwriting discipline is not only accretive to EPS, but also our brand and our overall platform. CrowdStrike: However, we absolutely think it'll affirm current levels. It will inspire incremental buyers. And perhaps more importantly, the event is a reminder of how dependent we are becoming on web based delivery as an economy. It's really incomprehensible how many companies still remain underinsured. So we do. There might not be immediate changes in pricing. There will be changes in buying habit."

            "content": "Thank you very much Pat. I want to echo Pat's comments on how excited we are to execute on our M&A strategy. Turning to Slide 4, Delegated Authority continues to be an enormous long-term opportunity and one of the core reasons for Ryan Specialty's founding. We have focused intently on building Ryan Specialty as a home where the best underwriters are empowered to innovate. We approached Delegated Authority through multiple avenues, each a touch point for Ryan Specialty to deliver value to carriers along the entire continuum of binding, programs and MGUs. Our Programs business targets niche industry verticals with a defined product set with typically smaller average premiums in our MGUs. This is the most significant enhancement to our Programs business since adding all risk national programs unit in 2020 and adds what we believe is one of the largest independent programs. We believe there's a long runway for consolidation and innovation in the Programs segment. With US Assure our underwriting management specialty will now make up 28% of Ryan Specialty's total revenue and coupled with Binding Authority takes Delegated Authority to 41%, highlighting the diversification of our platform. We will be larger, more diversified and better equipped to provide innovative industry leading solutions to our insurance brokers, agents and carriers. Hi, this is Miles. We appreciate the question, and no, there is not noticeable seasonality as indicated in the release. This is a substantial amount of enforced policies, approximately 150,000. These are small tickets taking place over the course of the year."

            "name": "Jeremiah Bickham",
            "content": "Thank you, Tim. Before diving into the quarterly results and acquisition details, I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to become President of Ryan Specialty. I've dedicated the last nearly 13 years of my career to Ryan's specialty and I'm incredibly fortunate to have worked so closely with Pat, Tim, Miles and the entire team as we have built this exceptional firm. I would like to thank Pat for continuing to be a part of the executive team as a true player coach. My charge is to continue building on what Pat and Tim have created at Ryan Specialty, delivering innovative solutions to our clients, generating industry-leading organic growth, executing on our M&A strategy, increasing profitability and delivering additional value to our shareholders. I've worked closely with Janice for many years and I am thrilled that she will be taking over as CFO, come October 1. Her strong financial expertise and dynamic leadership will help us build on our proven strategy. Now turning to the quarter, total revenue grew 18.8% period-over-period to $695 million, fueled by another very strong quarter of organic growth at 14.2% and contributions from M&A which added nearly 5 percentage points to our top line. Growth was once again driven by very strong renewal retention, ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business. Adjusted EBITDAC grew 27.6% period-over-period to $248 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin improved 240 basis points to 35.6% driven by another quarter of strong revenue growth, savings from ACCELERATE 2025 and underlying margin improvement in our business. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28.9% to $0.58 per share. Earlier today our Board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 payable later this month. Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program, we had approximately $8 million in charges for the quarter, bringing our total thus far to $85 million and we remain on track to achieve annual savings of approximately $60 million in 2025. We continue to expect that approximately half of these savings will be realized in 2024, with the majority of those savings falling to our bottom line. Those savings will be paired with underlying margin expansion in our business and we expect further underlying margin expansion in the years to come. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.1% for the quarter. Based on the current environment, we would expect a similar tax rate for the remainder of 2024. Turning to our acquisition of US Assure and Slide 8 of our supplemental presentation. As Pat, Tim and Miles have mentioned, we are very excited to announce this acquisition as it clearly fits within our long-term strategy and represents a meaningful boost to our Delegated Authority offering. We are acquiring 100% of the equity interest of US Assure for a base purchase price of $1.075 billion in cash, which represents 12.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA. There is also contingent consideration of up to $400 million available if the company meets certain growth and profitability targets. Please note that this acquisition is an asset deal for tax purposes. We will be funding the upfront consideration of the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from newly issued debt. We very recently upsized our revolving credit facility to $1.4 billion and executed a $500 million 364-day bridge facility which we intend to replace with proceeds from a syndicated market transaction in Q3. Importantly, following the close of this transaction, we expect no change in our financial policy, including our leverage comfort corridor of 3 to 4 times total net leverage, and expect our credit ratings to remain consistent. Assuming the transaction and debt raise are completed by 09/01 we expect GAAP interest expense, excluding the amortization of deferred issuance cost of approximately $35 million in Q3 and approximately $46 million in Q4. These estimates are based on our current assessment of market conditions and subject to the terms we achieve under our upcoming debt offering. The US Assure transaction is expected to be immediately accretive. We expect adjusted EPS accretion of approximately $0.01 to $0.02 from September through December and approximately $0.06 in year one. Turning to guidance, we are now guiding our organic revenue growth rate for the full year 2024 to be between 13.0% and 14.0%, which reflects an increase of 50 basis points to the floor compared to our previous guide range of 12.5% to 14.0%. Assuming the US Assure transaction is completed on 09/01, we are guiding to a full year adjusted EBITDAC margin between 32.0% and 32.5%, up from our prior guide range of 31.0% to 31.5%. In summary, it is a very exciting time at Ryan Specialty. We continue to perform at a very high level. We once again grew market share in several of our businesses while continuing to invest in our platform and we executed on significant M&A that will strengthen our organic growth engine for years to come. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest organically in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth. We will continue to execute on our disciplined M&A strategy with high quality acquisitions and we will maintain our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which should create long-term sustainable value for shareholders. Our dynamic and differentiated business model continues to position us well to serve our clients and deliver innovative solutions that our clients have come to expect as a hallmark of Ryan Specialty. With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Confirmed that that is the adjusted EBITDAC margin that we believe is very sustainable long-term in the mid-60s. As to why, there's a couple reasons, and I'll let Pat take those. As you know, we increased, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Okay. We have a history with our acquisitions, as you know, of really helping them to improve productivity, and that's been representative in just about every acquisition we've done. And we expect that to be a significant opportunity to help lift their traditional organic rates of growth, because we can get them into more brokers. We will have the ability to place business that Zurich doesn't have the appetite for, but we cannot take those from the admitted market, but the declination by Zurich and two others, two other admitted carriers, we can then produce those in the E&S market for them. So instead of just having that business fall out, there's an opportunity to put them into the market that they belong in. Additionally, the online portal has significant opportunities to expand, something that we've been working very hard on for a long time, and that is electronic trading products. And this group has started out in 1997. It's very early in terms of electronic trading, so they're quite proficient at it. So we believe that working together with them will expand opportunities for electronic trading. And as you know, binding business is really principally SME. So we have a very strong SME market share. As you've seen, our contract binding business grows very rapidly. This adds to that very significantly. So it's been a strategy for our firm since 2015 to expand into what we call our spokes strategy into smaller cities, not small towns, but cities that are not the urban hubs and right small commercial, and we've been moving that into electronic trading. So this fills our SME strategy. This enhances our electronic trading strategy. And so the strategic rationale for this is as fulsome as we could have anticipated. Well Meyer, presently they are independent, but RT will have expanded access to the US Assure portal. Currently, it's a relatively limited appointment basis that will be opened up. As Pat touched on, we expect the addition of incremental flow from RT and incremental flow from Ryan aligned retailers to the incremental submissions into the platform. So they're independent today. It is possible within the future that we could offer a quote on US Assure through the connector or they can come direct to the US Assure portal. Meyer, they are on a, they earned over three years on average. So anything collected this year is the result of 24 to 36 months ago. I want to reiterate what some of my colleagues said. This is a book of substantial policy count, typically lower limit business than a lot of the other Delegated Authority in our family. There is not material cat exposure and therefore the team feels good about the projections within the book, that we are expecting it later in the year. Yes, well, thank you for that. We want to emphasize that US Assure has been exceptional double-digit grower throughout the cycle. Certainly over the last 18 months, higher interest rates have put pressure on housing starts. They've grown throughout that pressure. We want to highlight, and it also doesn't change the macro addressable opportunity. So the US has a structural housing shortfall of over 2 million units. The vacancy levels in new and used homes are at multi-decade lows. We have an aging housing stock in the US. And so looking ahead, interest rates are in fact poised to subside. Building materials and inflationary pressures are now down to pre-COVID levels, at least on building material costs. And so our view is this, this business has been capturing the opportunity and is poised to really move ahead over the coming years."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for Ryan Specialty Holdings First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. In addition to this call, the company filed a press release with the SEC earlier this afternoon which has also been posted to its website at ryanspecialty.com.\n On today's call, management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. Investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Listeners are encouraged to review the more detailed discussion of these risk factors contained in the company's filings with the SEC. The company assumes no duty to update such forward-looking statements in the future, except as required by law.\n Additionally, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this call and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP are included in the earnings release, which is filed with the SEC and available on the company's website.\n With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to the Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ryan Specialty, Pat Ryan. \nPatrick Ryan: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. With me on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; and our CEO of underwriting managers, Miles Wuller. Also with us is our Director of Investor Relations, Nick Mezick.\n The first quarter represents a very strong start to the year. Our momentum throughout 2023 carried right into our excellent first quarter. We generated excellent top and bottom line results and made long-term sustainable investments in our business to fortify our competitive position. Revenue of $552 million represents growth of 20.6% year-over-year, driven by organic growth of 13.7% on top of the strong growth we posted in the first quarter of 2023.\n Growth was broad-based across our Specialties, a significant new business production and a meaningful contribution from our recent acquisitions. We grew adjusted EBITDAC 25.8% to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 120 basis points to 28.5%, reflecting the benefits of our ACCELERATE 2025 program and underlying margin improvement. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 34.6% to $0.35 per share. Our results clearly reflect our formidable value proposition of differentiated talent and niche specialization.\n We continue to outperform the competition, as reflected in our strong new business growth. We captured broader E&S tailwinds and capitalized on specific areas of accelerated growth. Property continued to be very strong even on top of a great prior year. Casualty was also a significant contributor, and we saw a strong acceleration in growth year-over-year. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Our industry-leading team's dedication to delivering better value and service for our clients is unmatched.\n Turning to the market, trends remain positive. We continue to believe the E&S market will consistently outpace growth in the admitted market, overshadowing any cyclical shifts in certain lines with respect to submission, flow and pricing. We continue to believe secular changes are driving most of the growth that we're seeing in the E&S market.\n Now turning to M&A. We have completed our acquisition of Castel Underwriting Agencies. Through this transaction, we bolstered our delegated authority offering by adding top talent and differentiated intellectual capital. We also significantly enhanced our U.K. and European footprint and set the stage to accelerate our international expansion. We're pleased to have the Castel team on board and we look forward to integrating this great business in the Ryan Specialty.\n Further on the M&A front, our outlook remains ambitious. Our pipeline continues to be robust, including both tuck-ins and large deals. As we previously noted, our overall strategy is aligned around the evolving and growing needs of our clients and our trading partners, to continue providing a dynamic value proposition. We are committed to expanding our total addressable market within specialty insurance, particularly with targeted investments in delegated authority, benefits and alternative risks as well as deepening our considerable moat by enhancing our scale, scope and intellectual capital. We only move forward when all of our criteria for M&A are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive.\n Turning to talent. Our people remain our greatest asset. We successfully onboarded new colleagues, adding to our world-class team through the first quarter. We believe that these important investments across our specialties will drive our firm's future prospects and will position us to grow for decades. We believe our commitment to constant innovation and ongoing investment in talent has enabled us to consistently achieve industry-leading organic growth.\n Now turning to ACCELERATE 2025. As we continue to execute on the program, we identified additional opportunities to drive continued growth and innovation, deliver sustainable productivity increases over the longer term and accelerate margin improvement. We now expect to generate annual savings of approximately $60 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges of approximately $110 million through the end of 2024.\n These investments will both enhance and scale up our operating model, enabling us to move faster, resulting in lasting benefits to our clients. We are creating platforms and systems that are capable of handling significant future organic and inorganic growth. Looking ahead, the second quarter is off to a strong start and we are encouraged by continued momentum across each of our specialties.\n I'm confident that 2024 will be an outstanding year for our firm. We believe our growth will continue to be driven by secular factors, such as increasing risk and complexity. Retail brokers becoming larger through solid organic growth and M&A, as well as panel consolidation. Adding to this is our unique competitive position with strategies and high-growth businesses. Our ability to innovate with new product development and the expansion of our total addressable market. We remain confident these trends are sustainable and supportive of our growth for the foreseeable future.\n As always, I want to thank our entire team for their dedication in once again delivering excellent performance and adding value for our clients, trading partners and ultimately, our shareholders.\n I'm pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim? \nTimothy Turner: Thank you very much, Pat. We had a very strong start to 2024 across our specialties. Our entire team remains determined to sustain that momentum throughout the year.\n Diving into our specialties. Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty generated strong growth. Our property practice had a great quarter, even on top of a great prior year. The property market continues to be impacted by elevated levels of attritional and secondary perils, including severe convective storms, more retention of risk and moderating yet persistent inflation driving up loss costs. With expectations for a year of an above-average number of hurricanes and other named storms, we expect concerns for large loss events to be top of mind for the industry.\n Add to this, growing property exposures in both high-value concentrations and areas of higher catastrophe risk, like floodplains, coast and wildfire prone areas. We believe we will continue to see an increase in the frequency and severity of losses. And all of these factors are driving continued flow of new business into the E&S market and high retention as risks remain in our channel. At the same time, our deep bench of talented professionals is successfully navigating this dynamic environment through our laser focus on continuously providing value to our clients, we believe we continue to win market share from our competitors.\n We continue to believe property will be a strong driver of growth for Ryan Specialty in the quarters ahead. Even as we lap last year's excellent quarter, our casualty practice had a fantastic quarter. More broadly, the market has seen an increasing number of casualty classes face higher loss costs.\n Notably, an acceleration of social inflation marked by increased frequency and more prolonged cases, higher settlements, judgments and nuclear verdicts, amplified by litigation finance. A protracted impact from recent reserve charges on the 2015 to 2019 accident years, as well as rising uncertainty in reserve adequacy of more recent years and the continued pullback in risk appetite from the admitted market in certain E&S lines like construction.\n This unpredictability requires specific industry and product level knowledge, thanks to our world-class technical expertise and deep bench we are perfectly positioned to execute and deliver value for our clients. We are confident that casualty will be a strong contributor to our 2024 performance. Overall, our Wholesale Brokerage specialty team remains committed to delivering innovative strategies and products to meet the ever-changing needs of our clients.\n Now turning to our delegated authority specialties, which include both Binding and Underwriting Management. Our Binding Authority specialty had an excellent quarter. Through our high-caliber talent and new proprietary products, we offer a seamless experience for our clients who have small but tough to place commercial P&C risks. We continue to believe the consolidation of panels in Binding Authority remains a long-term growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to capitalize.\n Our Underwriting Management specialty also performed well in the quarter led by property and casualty, and meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions. As Pat noted, we are excited to officially onboard Castel to the Ryan Specialty family which adds to our top decile talent, expands our international footprint, makes us stronger in the U.K. and Europe, and positions us well to accelerate our international expansion.\n Turning to price. While we continue to experience various micro cycles across insurance lines, more broadly, we see two important trends; property is seeing a period of pricing stabilization after years of large increases, and casualty due to the trends mentioned earlier, is seeing an acceleration in pricing across an increasing number of classes. Across both of these major industry classes, there remains heightened uncertainty in the loss environment. This is driving more risks into the E&S marketplace as it offers significantly more freedom of rate and form and the ability for insurers and underwriters to adjust pricing and the terms and conditions of coverage more quickly.\n As we've noted consistently in any cycle as certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy, admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. However, this is still not playing out, and the standard market is not meaningfully impacted rate or flow in the aggregate. We are well positioned to assist all our trading partners navigate an ever-changing insurance landscape. We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialties growth more so than rate.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our first quarter. Thank you. \nJeremiah Bickham: Thank you, Tim. Before getting into our results for the quarter, I want to discuss the change highlighted in our press release.\n Beginning this quarter, the company is modifying its method of calculating organic revenue growth. This revised calculation methodology is an improved representation of our core business performance, as it now completely removes fiduciary investment income and contingent commissions from the current and prior year period, whereas before, we only excluded the change in fiduciary income and contingent commissions between periods. Of course, the new calculation continues to exclude the impact of M&A and FX from the current year. This formulation is a more widely used calculation methodology and as a result, we are providing additional revenue disclosure that we believe investors will find very useful.\n Now turning to the quarter. In Q1, we grew total revenue 20.6% period-over-period to $552 million, fueled by another very strong quarter of organic revenue growth at 13.7%. And contributions from M&A, which added nearly 7 percentage point to our topline. Growth was once again driven by very strong renewal retention, ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business.\n Adjusted EBITDAC for the first quarter grew 25.8% period-over-period to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin improved 120 basis points to 28.5%, driven by another strong quarter of revenue growth, partial savings from ACCELERATE 2025 and underlying margin improvement in the business. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 34.6% to $0.35 per share. In the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through our first dividend, including both a special and a regular quarterly dividend. Earlier today, our board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 payable later this month.\n Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program. We had approximately $29 million in charges for the quarter, bringing our total to date to $77 million. As Pat noted, we found additional opportunities to drive more efficiencies and greater savings. We now expect cumulative special charges for the program of approximately $110 million through the end of 2024, and expect annual savings of approximately $60 million in 2025. We expect approximately half of these savings will be realized in 2024 with the majority of those savings falling to our bottom line. Those savings will be paired with an underlying margin expansion in our business that we expect in most years, including 2024.\n Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense which is net of interest income on our operating funds of approximately $32 million in Q2 and $123 million in 2024. Our adjusted effective tax rate was [ $0.261 ] for the quarter. Based on the current environment, we expect a similar tax rate for the remainder of 2024.\n Now turning to guidance. Under the legacy method for calculating organic revenue growth, we are maintaining our full year 2024 guidance for organic revenue growth. Now adjusting solely for the modified methodology, which we will be reporting under going forward, our revised guidance for the full year 2024 is now between 12.5% and 14.0%. In addition, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDAC margin guidance of 31.0% and 31.5%.\n In summary, we are pleased with our very strong first quarter performance as we grew market share in several of our businesses, invested in talent, products and technology, all while expanding margin. Moving forward, we will continue to organically invest in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth. We will continue to execute on our disciplined M&A strategy with high-quality acquisitions, and we will maintain our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which should create long-term sustainable value for shareholders.\n Our dynamic and differentiated business model continues to position us well to serve our clients and deliver the innovative solutions that our clients have come to expect as a hallmark of Ryan Specialty.\n With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, just, I guess, your organic growth view, right, it sounds like it's similar to last quarter minus the accounting change that you highlighted. Over the past couple of months, we've seen some volatility within some staffing data that comes out from some of the largest E&S states, went down in March and then we saw some growth in April. Can you just help us like triangulate what we see within the stamping data and what that means for the overall strength of the E&S market? \nTimothy Turner: Sure, Elyse. We feel that several questions about the monthly stamping office numbers in prior quarters. And the stamping office data is very helpful over a full calendar year, and it remains very -- the flow remains very strong, as we can see. But on a month or even a quarter, it could be misleading and have timing issues, and that's really what we saw here. Our growth trends through the stamping office data are better measured over a full year. But again, they remain very strong, double-digit growth flow. \nElyse Greenspan: And then my second question, you guys raised the savings program, right? And also raised the amount that you expect to see this year, but there wasn't a change to the margin guide. So can you -- is it just that there's some offsets relative to the guidance? Or you're just -- and I know there's obviously a range around margin and that could be it too? \nJeremiah Bickham: Elyse, fair question. So the $10 million of additional saves from Accelerate. Remember that only about half of them, like the rest of the saves from the program are going to come through this year. And we've said the majority, but not all, will fall to the bottom line. And also, I mean, I'm sure you know that there's the possibility of fewer interest rate cuts this year too, which would present a benefit to margin as well. These are just a few variables at play though and while they're positive, there's still a long way to go in the year. And what we're -- what we think that both of these two variables represent is just a higher likelihood that we hit the high end of the range on our margin guide. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then you guys seem pretty positive on the casualty market, right? You said property is stabilizing. Is there anything we should be paying attention to, just in terms of your mix and what quarters? I guess, of the remaining 3 could see higher versus maybe slightly lower organic growth? I know, I think Q2 and Q4 are heavier from a property perspective, but anything that you would highlight in terms of the cadence of growth in the back 3 quarters? \nTimothy Turner: No, nothing that stands out, Elyse. Casualty, our casualty practice had a fantastic quarter. We're seeing an acceleration in pricing across increasing number of classes, higher loss trends are really driving pricing. We can see a significant increase in flow into the channel. In some of the classes we've talked about before, transportation, habitational. And in property, we've mentioned before, it continues to be a very strong driver for us in '24. However, we're seeing some pricing stabilization and after years of large increases.\n But the data is mixed because so much of it is slanted towards admitted standard lines property business. What we're seeing in the non-admitted market is more volatility, more difficult risks being layered, we see growth opportunities throughout the market. As you know, it's a wind buying season in the second quarter, and we're very excited about that. We see it as a growth opportunity this year. \nJeremiah Bickham: And Elyse, I want to add to that and try to be helpful. There's seasonality to our business, so we've said Q2 is our biggest in terms of dollars, but there's not seasonality -- predictable seasonality anyway to our organic growth. And if you look at any 2 quarters and you infer a trend from that, you're just as likely to get a wrong answer as you are a right answer. So please don't make the mistake of inferring a trend just because 1 quarter follows higher or lower than the other. That's why we give guidance in the first place is to give people the best possible view of how the year will turn out versus an individual quarter. \nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. \nMichael Zaremski: I was kind of hoping being later in the queue because it's -- we don't have a lot of time to figure out the new improved organic guide, in a good way. But -- so under the old, the 12.5% to 14% is the -- okay, the organic guide used to be 12% to 13.5% last quarter. What would it have been under the new definition? \nJeremiah Bickham: The new definition is 12.5% to 14%. The old guide range was 12% to 13.5%. And the reason we changed it is because our expectation is, is that just under -- just changing the calculation methodology could improve organic by about 50 basis points this year. So we're trying to be transparent and really just give you an apples-to-apples guide range. We're definitely more confident, even more confident than we were the last time we spoke. In our ability to deliver in this guide range, but we're just reiterating the guide range on an apples-to-apples basis. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. So maybe I'm -- but if we just went back to the last quarter when you gave your original 12% to 13.5%. What would have been under the new definition? Or am I not thinking about it correctly, but it's still... \nJeremiah Bickham: If we had made the change last quarter, we would have come out with an annual guide range of 12.5% to 14%. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Just -- so, 50 bps this way. Okay. Just want to... \nJeremiah Bickham: It's expected to be worth 50 bps this year. And it's more pronounced in -- the difference is more pronounced in Q1 because Q1 is typically when there's actually more profit commissions that hit. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay -- bearing with me on that. Okay. My follow-up is if we look at where the business mix is heading, and I know you don't break out organic by the three business lines, but it's -- Underwriting Management and Binding Authorities are growing disproportionately whereas obviously, Wholesale is still growing at a very healthy rate. But anything incremental you'd want to add and you've given us a lot of color about these segments in the past. But anything changing -- anything incremental that you can kind of -- I feel like us and maybe the sell side and maybe some investors we focus a little too much on the largest segment, so anything more you want to add on kind of what's driving this and maybe other seasonality patterns, too? \nJeremiah Bickham: Well, I'll give some color, Mike, on the numbers you're probably looking at, like a 30-plus percent in Underwriting Management. Remember, that's total revenue growth. And there's a significant impact this quarter. I mean the growth numbers from both the delegated authority businesses were terrific, but it it's even more [indiscernible] in underwriting management because of M&A last year. That's where the benefits business is being housed until it's material enough to be broken out on its own. So if that's the number you're reacting to, that's a big part of the story. But longer-term growth prospects, Miles can give you a much more fulsome color on that. \nMiles Wuller: Look, we appreciate the question. So I think at the heart of it, yes, underwriting is definitely contributing to the double-digit organic trajectory. I think we highlighted each quarter, a lot of the ingredients that we delivered on last year and structurally, they're all in place to continue into this year. Last year, we brought several new MGUs to life. We did -- we've already launched one in Q1 of this year. Last year, we launched several tangential lines to existing MGUs. And now we're seeing the benefit of that coming into the earnings statement as organic revenue.\n And then lastly, we're able to include our carrier capital under management with the greater majority of our partners last year, and that was through incremental lines of business as well as increased capital being deployed. And so again, those increases of capital under management, we're seeing flow into organic this year. So that's specific to the underwriting line, and I'll let Tim comment on Binding. \nTimothy Turner: Our Binding Authority had a tremendous first quarter. We're seeing just great expansion and market share being taken there. We're capitalizing on the consolidation of the use of Binding Authority intermediaries by the retailers. We're winning a lot of RFPs and the outlook for '24 looks fantastic. \nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. \nRobert Cox: Just in regards to organic growth pacing and how to think about it for the balance of the year? I know there's a lot of property business next quarter and it seems like property is still strong, but there's also a lot of property CAT, and I think that's an area where we've heard there are some more meaningful price deceleration. So I'm just curious if you think that's a headwind next quarter. If you could give any color on sort of the pacing of organic growth throughout the remainder of the year. \nTimothy Turner: We don't see it as a headwind. We see the pricing stabilization. We're not seeing dramatic cuts at all. We're not seeing a shift in the migration of the non-admitted business. We're seeing continued heavy flow into the channel. We're seeing a little bit more competition in London. But again, the flow remains very strong. and we're optimistic to have a great year in property. \nJeremiah Bickham: Yes. And Rob, building on the response that I chimed in with to Elyse's question, growth for the year doesn't follow a straight line. I'm sorry, we can't be more helpful. But there's nothing significant in any of the quarters this year that's worth calling out to guide you to something to a big shift. Like Tim said, the growth we expect is really balanced across property and casualty this year. \nRobert Cox: Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up. I was just curious on some of the specific areas you guys have called out in the past, like the D&O headwinds, M&A headwinds, how did those shape up in the quarter? And I was also curious on the construction projects, which I think you guys have previously called out. It seems like it might have been a material tailwind for some of your peers -- did you also see that in the quarter? \nTimothy Turner: Yes. We've seen the construction market have a real strong rebound. Our project opportunities increased, our quote to bind ratios increased. We're capturing a lot more construction business across the board, residential construction in particular, infrastructure projects picked up and that lag time from quote to bind has decreased. So we're very optimistic to have a great year in construction. D&O would be where the tailwinds have slowed. I think we're through the pain phase. We see some moderation there on the tougher D&O, our E&O book continues to grow in areas like healthcare and social service. We're getting opportunities in things like architect and engineers E&O, lawyers E&O, the headwinds on that pro-executive book have clearly slowed, and we see growth opportunities in '24. And then Pat could address the M&A. \nPatrick Ryan: Yes. The M&A is strong, as I said in my opening comments, a very robust pipeline. There's no seasonality to the M&A calendar. We'll often have periods of time that are quiet, and then periods where we announced multiple deals in a short period. But to answer your question, the outlook is very strong. We've been engaged in several discussions. We've encountered more opportunities, we made a pretty encouraging progress on most of the open dialogues, the flow of deals are all high strategic value deals that we're working on.\n And the theme of sellers preferring Ryan Specialty as a destination of choice is very exciting for us because historically, well over a half of the just short of 60 acquisitions that we've done, we were the destination of choice. And in the discussions that we're engaged in, that's being sustained. \nMiles Wuller: Rob, this is Miles. I'll just jump in. On transactional liability as it pertains to like a rep & warranty and tax practice, so there are tailwinds. So global M&A deal volumes are ticking back up, we believe our transactional liability practice is materially outpacing the industry. I think everybody will recall, we highlighted several times during 2023 that we had been investing heavily in transactional liability, talent and geographic reach as the market was contracting. And all those decisions are bearing fruit, and we expect to be great contributors to 2024. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Tim, I was hoping you could go maybe one level deeper in terms of the property business that's still migrating to E&S because I guess the mental model I had was that last year you had primary companies just dealing with much higher reinsurance attachment points. So the CAT-exposed business kind of moved over. And I'm wondering maybe overly simplistically, what's left to go to E&S now? \nTimothy Turner: We see opportunities to get market share and just head-to-head competition. That's always a big factor. As you know, there's competition on all this business. We don't see any sign of migration of the business going back. So there's still very strong flow of opportunities that move around in the marketplace. The only real competition in terms of taking business away from the U.S. E&S market, Meyer, would be London. And that's hardly measurable, but we did notice it, and we did mention it in our last call.\n But in terms of opportunities, we see a very strong flow coming our way. There's no standard carrier making an impact on taking E&S business back. We just don't see it. In fact, we're having to layer and have more shared and layered opportunities on these towers. It's still very, very robust out there. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. I think this is probably for Jeremiah. When we look at the adjusted ratios, so Comp and Ben on one hand, and G&A on the others. The Comp and Ben went down year-over-year, and G&A went up. Should we expect that trend to accelerate or decelerate as we start seeing the $60 million of savings start to hit bottom line this year or next year? \nJeremiah Bickham: So we are going to see additional scaling in Comp for sure. And over time, we'll see scaling in G&A, too. But this quarter, in particular, there were some timing issues related to some of our planned spend even on like the T&E side events change between quarters year-over-year. And we also have some new revenue lines that are coming on that we will incur third-party expenses too on some of the upfront work. So overall, I would say you're going to see trending in the -- you're going to see scaling in both, but it's probably going to come -- it's going to be a little bit more pronounced and be quicker on the Comp side, call it, over the next 24 -- next 7 quarters. \nOperator: Our next question is from Alison Jacobowitz with UBS. \nAlison Jacobowitz: I was just wondering, you touched on what you're seeing -- that you're seeing great opportunities internationally. So wondering if you could dive a little deeper into that. Where are you most focused? What you're seeing there and maybe some -- highlight some of the dramatic differences you might be seeing there, if there are any, versus domestic? \nMiles Wuller: Yes. No, we appreciate that. And I want to highlight with the Castel acquisition. We benefited from several levers there. So first, it brought 135 like-minded individuals based in the U.K. and the Benelux region. All like-minded builders, entrepreneurs, great track record of underwriting profitability and building businesses. It brought 10 new lines to the company. And it actually allowed us to double down in a few capabilities that we believe deeply in renewables, SME, Rep & Warranty.\n But that on top of those facilities, it also brought us some local leadership in those jurisdictions that are going to be great resources in identifying talent essentially getting city to city, it's not going to surprise you that a lot of distributors want to deal with a local presence, and it's going to take an on-the-ground approach to meet those folks. And so this team will be a force multiplier in helping us identify M&A opportunities as well as increase the speed to market of international start-ups. \nPatrick Ryan: I'd like to add that we see international, particularly Europe and the U.K. as not fertile ground for a wholesale broking, but very fertile ground for delegated authority. There's been a lot of consolidation of carriers in those countries. They are great companies in each one of the -- various European countries, including the U.K., but they're far fewer and it allows an opportunity for delegated authority for us to bring in new capital providers or work with some of the existing over there with innovative ideas on product. Innovative ideas on servicing different parts of the insurance industry.\n So as we look at international, particularly Europe and the U.K., it's really a delegated authority. But we think it's quite wide open. It requires, as Miles said, attracting the right talent, and that's why the Castel acquisition was so exciting plus a great underwriting record. There's a lot of talent that we know over there from other experiences. And we believe that we can do de novos and possibly some M&A opportunities. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. And I will turn the call back to Pat Ryan for closing remarks. \nPatrick Ryan: Well, thank you for your very good questions and for your continued interest and support of our firm. We look forward to speaking with you again soon, and have a good evening. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "content": "Thank you, Tim. Before getting into our results for the quarter, I want to discuss the change highlighted in our press release.\n Beginning this quarter, the company is modifying its method of calculating organic revenue growth. This revised calculation methodology is an improved representation of our core business performance, as it now completely removes fiduciary investment income and contingent commissions from the current and prior year period, whereas before, we only excluded the change in fiduciary income and contingent commissions between periods. Of course, the new calculation continues to exclude the impact of M&A and FX from the current year. This formulation is a more widely used calculation methodology and as a result, we are providing additional revenue disclosure that we believe investors will find very useful.\n Now turning to the quarter. In Q1, we grew total revenue 20.6% period-over-period to $552 million, fueled by another very strong quarter of organic revenue growth at 13.7%. And contributions from M&A, which added nearly 7 percentage point to our topline. Growth was once again driven by very strong renewal retention, ongoing tailwinds in much of the E&S market and our ability to win substantial amounts of new business.\n Adjusted EBITDAC for the first quarter grew 25.8% period-over-period to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin improved 120 basis points to 28.5%, driven by another strong quarter of revenue growth, partial savings from ACCELERATE 2025 and underlying margin improvement in the business. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 34.6% to $0.35 per share. In the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through our first dividend, including both a special and a regular quarterly dividend. Earlier today, our board declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 payable later this month.\n Turning to our ACCELERATE 2025 program. We had approximately $29 million in charges for the quarter, bringing our total to date to $77 million. As Pat noted, we found additional opportunities to drive more efficiencies and greater savings. We now expect cumulative special charges for the program of approximately $110 million through the end of 2024, and expect annual savings of approximately $60 million in 2025. We expect approximately half of these savings will be realized in 2024 with the majority of those savings falling to our bottom line. Those savings will be paired with an underlying margin expansion in our business that we expect in most years, including 2024.\n Based on our current forecast, we expect to record GAAP interest expense which is net of interest income on our operating funds of approximately $32 million in Q2 and $123 million in 2024. Our adjusted effective tax rate was [ $0.261 ] for the quarter. Based on the current environment, we expect a similar tax rate for the remainder of 2024.\n Now turning to guidance. Under the legacy method for calculating organic revenue growth, we are maintaining our full year 2024 guidance for organic revenue growth. Now adjusting solely for the modified methodology, which we will be reporting under going forward, our revised guidance for the full year 2024 is now between 12.5% and 14.0%. In addition, we are maintaining our adjusted EBITDAC margin guidance of 31.0% and 31.5%.\n In summary, we are pleased with our very strong first quarter performance as we grew market share in several of our businesses, invested in talent, products and technology, all while expanding margin. Moving forward, we will continue to organically invest in our business to support sustainable and profitable growth. We will continue to execute on our disciplined M&A strategy with high-quality acquisitions, and we will maintain our strong balance sheet while returning excess cash, all of which should create long-term sustainable value for shareholders.\n Our dynamic and differentiated business model continues to position us well to serve our clients and deliver the innovative solutions that our clients have come to expect as a hallmark of Ryan Specialty.\n With that, we thank you for your time and would like to open up the call for Q&A. Operator? Elyse, fair question. So the $10 million of additional saves from Accelerate. Remember that only about half of them, like the rest of the saves from the program are going to come through this year. And we've said the majority, but not all, will fall to the bottom line. And also, I mean, I'm sure you know that there's the possibility of fewer interest rate cuts this year too, which would present a benefit to margin as well. These are just a few variables at play though and while they're positive, there's still a long way to go in the year. And what we're -- what we think that both of these two variables represent is just a higher likelihood that we hit the high end of the range on our margin guide. And Elyse, I want to add to that and try to be helpful. There's seasonality to our business, so we've said Q2 is our biggest in terms of dollars, but there's not seasonality -- predictable seasonality anyway to our organic growth. And if you look at any 2 quarters and you infer a trend from that, you're just as likely to get a wrong answer as you are a right answer. So please don't make the mistake of inferring a trend just because 1 quarter follows higher or lower than the other. That's why we give guidance in the first place is to give people the best possible view of how the year will turn out versus an individual quarter. The new definition is 12.5% to 14%. The old guide range was 12% to 13.5%. And the reason we changed it is because our expectation is, is that just under -- just changing the calculation methodology could improve organic by about 50 basis points this year. So we're trying to be transparent and really just give you an apples-to-apples guide range. We're definitely more confident, even more confident than we were the last time we spoke. In our ability to deliver in this guide range, but we're just reiterating the guide range on an apples-to-apples basis. If we had made the change last quarter, we would have come out with an annual guide range of 12.5% to 14%. It's expected to be worth 50 bps this year. And it's more pronounced in -- the difference is more pronounced in Q1 because Q1 is typically when there's actually more profit commissions that hit. Well, I'll give some color, Mike, on the numbers you're probably looking at, like a 30-plus percent in Underwriting Management. Remember, that's total revenue growth. And there's a significant impact this quarter. I mean the growth numbers from both the delegated authority businesses were terrific, but it it's even more [indiscernible] in underwriting management because of M&A last year.

So overall, I would say you're going to see trending in the -- you're going to see scaling in both, but it's probably going to come -- it's going to be a little bit more pronounced and be quicker on the Comp side, call it, over the next 24 -- next 7 quarters."

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results. With me on today's call is our President, Tim Turner; our CFO, Jeremiah Bickham; and our CEO of underwriting managers, Miles Wuller. Also with us is our Director of Investor Relations, Nick Mezick.\n The first quarter represents a very strong start to the year. Our momentum throughout 2023 carried right into our excellent first quarter. We generated excellent top and bottom line results and made long-term sustainable investments in our business to fortify our competitive position. Revenue of $552 million represents growth of 20.6% year-over-year, driven by organic growth of 13.7% on top of the strong growth we posted in the first quarter of 2023.\n Growth was broad-based across our Specialties, a significant new business production and a meaningful contribution from our recent acquisitions. We grew adjusted EBITDAC 25.8% to $157 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 120 basis points to 28.5%, reflecting the benefits of our ACCELERATE 2025 program and underlying margin improvement. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 34.6% to $0.35 per share. Our results clearly reflect our formidable value proposition of differentiated talent and niche specialization.\n We continue to outperform the competition, as reflected in our strong new business growth. We captured broader E&S tailwinds and capitalized on specific areas of accelerated growth. Property continued to be very strong even on top of a great prior year. Casualty was also a significant contributor, and we saw a strong acceleration in growth year-over-year. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance in the quarter. Our industry-leading team's dedication to delivering better value and service for our clients is unmatched.\n Turning to the market, trends remain positive. We continue to believe the E&S market will consistently outpace growth in the admitted market, overshadowing any cyclical shifts in certain lines with respect to submission, flow and pricing. We continue to believe secular changes are driving most of the growth that we're seeing in the E&S market.\n Now turning to M&A. We have completed our acquisition of Castel Underwriting Agencies. Through this transaction, we bolstered our delegated authority offering by adding top talent and differentiated intellectual capital. We also significantly enhanced our U.K. and European footprint and set the stage to accelerate our international expansion. We're pleased to have the Castel team on board and we look forward to integrating this great business in the Ryan Specialty.\n Further on the M&A front, our outlook remains ambitious. Our pipeline continues to be robust, including both tuck-ins and large deals. As we previously noted, our overall strategy is aligned around the evolving and growing needs of our clients and our trading partners, to continue providing a dynamic value proposition. We are committed to expanding our total addressable market within specialty insurance, particularly with targeted investments in delegated authority, benefits and alternative risks as well as deepening our considerable moat by enhancing our scale, scope and intellectual capital. We only move forward when all of our criteria for M&A are met. Each acquisition must be a strong cultural fit, strategic and accretive.\n Turning to talent. Our people remain our greatest asset. We successfully onboarded new colleagues, adding to our world-class team through the first quarter. We believe that these important investments across our specialties will drive our firm's future prospects and will position us to grow for decades. We believe our commitment to constant innovation and ongoing investment in talent has enabled us to consistently achieve industry-leading organic growth.\n Now turning to ACCELERATE 2025. As we continue to execute on the program, we identified additional opportunities to drive continued growth and innovation, deliver sustainable productivity increases over the longer term and accelerate margin improvement. We now expect to generate annual savings of approximately $60 million in 2025 with cumulative special charges of approximately $110 million through the end of 2024.\n These investments will both enhance and scale up our operating model, enabling us to move faster, resulting in lasting benefits to our clients. We are creating platforms and systems that are capable of handling significant future organic and inorganic growth. Looking ahead, the second quarter is off to a strong start and we are encouraged by continued momentum across each of our specialties.\n I'm confident that 2024 will be an outstanding year for our firm. We believe our growth will continue to be driven by secular factors, such as increasing risk and complexity. Retail brokers becoming larger through solid organic growth and M&A, as well as panel consolidation. Adding to this is our unique competitive position with strategies and high-growth businesses. Our ability to innovate with new product development and the expansion of our total addressable market. We remain confident these trends are sustainable and supportive of our growth for the foreseeable future.\n As always, I want to thank our entire team for their dedication in once again delivering excellent performance and adding value for our clients, trading partners and ultimately, our shareholders.\n I'm pleased to turn it over to Tim. Tim? Yes. The M&A is strong, as I said in my opening comments, a very robust pipeline. There's no seasonality to the M&A calendar. We'll often have periods of time that are quiet, and then periods where we announced multiple deals in a short period. But to answer your question, the outlook is very strong. We've been engaged in several discussions. We've encountered more opportunities, we made a pretty encouraging progress on most of the open dialogues, the flow of deals are all high strategic value deals that we're working on.\n And the theme of sellers preferring Ryan Specialty as a destination of choice is very exciting for us because historically, well over a half of the just short of 60 acquisitions that we've done, we were the destination of choice.

            "content": "Thank you very much, Pat. We had a very strong start to 2024 across our specialties. Our entire team remains determined to sustain that momentum throughout the year.\n Diving into our specialties. Our Wholesale Brokerage specialty generated strong growth. Our property practice had a great quarter, even on top of a great prior year. The property market continues to be impacted by elevated levels of attritional and secondary perils, including severe convective storms, more retention of risk and moderating yet persistent inflation driving up loss costs. With expectations for a year of an above-average number of hurricanes and other named storms, we expect concerns for large loss events to be top of mind for the industry.\n Add to this, growing property exposures in both high-value concentrations and areas of higher catastrophe risk, like floodplains, coast and wildfire prone areas. We believe we will continue to see an increase in the frequency and severity of losses. And all of these factors are driving continued flow of new business into the E&S market and high retention as risks remain in our channel. At the same time, our deep bench of talented professionals is successfully navigating this dynamic environment through our laser focus on continuously providing value to our clients, we believe we continue to win market share from our competitors.\n We continue to believe property will be a strong driver of growth for Ryan Specialty in the quarters ahead. Even as we lap last year's excellent quarter, our casualty practice had a fantastic quarter. More broadly, the market has seen an increasing number of casualty classes face higher loss costs.\n Notably, an acceleration of social inflation marked by increased frequency and more prolonged cases, higher settlements, judgments and nuclear verdicts, amplified by litigation finance. A protracted impact from recent reserve charges on the 2015 to 2019 accident years, as well as rising uncertainty in reserve adequacy of more recent years and the continued pullback in risk appetite from the admitted market in certain E&S lines like construction.\n This unpredictability requires specific industry and product level knowledge, thanks to our world-class technical expertise and deep bench we are perfectly positioned to execute and deliver value for our clients. We are confident that casualty will be a strong contributor to our 2024 performance. Overall, our Wholesale Brokerage specialty team remains committed to delivering innovative strategies and products to meet the ever-changing needs of our clients.\n Now turning to our delegated authority specialties, which include both Binding and Underwriting Management. Our Binding Authority specialty had an excellent quarter. Through our high-caliber talent and new proprietary products, we offer a seamless experience for our clients who have small but tough to place commercial P&C risks. We continue to believe the consolidation of panels in Binding Authority remains a long-term growth opportunity, and we are well positioned to capitalize.\n Our Underwriting Management specialty also performed well in the quarter led by property and casualty, and meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions. As Pat noted, we are excited to officially onboard Castel to the Ryan Specialty family which adds to our top decile talent, expands our international footprint, makes us stronger in the U.K. and Europe, and positions us well to accelerate our international expansion.\n Turning to price. While we continue to experience various micro cycles across insurance lines, more broadly, we see two important trends; property is seeing a period of pricing stabilization after years of large increases, and casualty due to the trends mentioned earlier, is seeing an acceleration in pricing across an increasing number of classes. Across both of these major industry classes, there remains heightened uncertainty in the loss environment. This is driving more risks into the E&S marketplace as it offers significantly more freedom of rate and form and the ability for insurers and underwriters to adjust pricing and the terms and conditions of coverage more quickly.\n As we've noted consistently in any cycle as certain lines are perceived to reach pricing adequacy, admitted markets tend to step back in on certain placements. However, this is still not playing out, and the standard market is not meaningfully impacted rate or flow in the aggregate. We are well positioned to assist all our trading partners navigate an ever-changing insurance landscape. We continue to expect the flow of business into the non-admitted market to be a significant driver of Ryan Specialties growth more so than rate.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jeremiah Bickham, who will give you more detail on the financial results of our first quarter. Thank you. Sure, Elyse. We feel that several questions about the monthly stamping office numbers in prior quarters. And the stamping office data is very helpful over a full calendar year, and it remains very -- the flow remains very strong, as we can see. But on a month or even a quarter, it could be misleading and have timing issues, and that's really what we saw here. Our growth trends through the stamping office data are better measured over a full year. But again, they remain very strong, double-digit growth flow. No, nothing that stands out, Elyse. Casualty, our casualty practice had a fantastic quarter. We're seeing an acceleration in pricing across increasing number of classes, higher loss trends are really driving pricing. We can see a significant increase in flow into the channel. In some of the classes we've talked about before, transportation, habitational. And in property, we've mentioned before, it continues to be a very strong driver for us in '24. However, we're seeing some pricing stabilization and after years of large increases.\n But the data is mixed because so much of it is slanted towards admitted standard lines property business. What we're seeing in the non-admitted market is more volatility, more difficult risks being layered, we see growth opportunities throughout the market. As you know, it's a wind buying season in the second quarter, and we're very excited about that. We see it as a growth opportunity this year. Our Binding Authority had a tremendous first quarter. We're seeing just great expansion and market share being taken there. We're capitalizing on the consolidation of the use of Binding Authority intermediaries by the retailers. We're winning a lot of RFPs and the outlook for '24 looks fantastic. We don't see it as a headwind. We see the pricing stabilization. We're not seeing dramatic cuts at all. We're not seeing a shift in the migration of the non-admitted business. We're seeing continued heavy flow into the channel. We're seeing a little bit more competition in London. But again, the flow remains very strong. and we're optimistic to have a great year in property. Yes. We've seen the construction market have a real strong rebound. Our project opportunities increased, our quote to bind ratios increased. We're capturing a lot more construction business across the board, residential construction in particular, infrastructure projects picked up and that lag time from quote to bind has decreased. So we're very optimistic to have a great year in construction. D&O would be where the tailwinds have slowed. I think we're through the pain phase. We see some moderation there on the tougher D&O, our E&O book continues to grow in areas like healthcare and social service. We're getting opportunities in things like architect and engineers E&O, lawyers E&O, the headwinds on that pro-executive book have clearly slowed, and we see growth opportunities in '24. And then Pat could address the M&A. We see opportunities to get market share and just head-to-head competition. That's always a big factor. As you know, there's competition on all this business. We don't see any sign of migration of the business going back. So there's still very strong flow of opportunities that move around in the marketplace. The only real competition in terms of taking business away from the U.S. E&S market, Meyer, would be London. And that's hardly measurable, but we did notice it, and we did mention it in our last call.\n But in terms of opportunities, we see a very strong flow coming our way. There's no standard carrier making an impact on taking E&S business back. We just don't see it. In fact, we're having to layer and have more shared and layered opportunities on these towers. It's still very, very robust out there."
