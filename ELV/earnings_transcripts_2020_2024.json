At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company\u2019s management. Please go ahead.\nChris Rigg: Good morning. this is Chris Rigg and welcome to Anthem\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. As many of you know, I have transitioned the Head of Investor Relations to be the Chief Financial Officer of our Commercial & Specialty Business division. Steve Tanal will be joining Anthem as the new Vice President of Investor Relations. So, we look forward to welcoming him next week. With us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem\u2019s fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Despite a year challenged by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty, we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $2.19 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.54. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $17.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $22.48. Our full-year results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 treatment costs and more normal utilization patterns in the second half of the year. Consistent with our expectations, fourth quarter utilization was above baseline, reflecting higher costs attributable to the recent surge of COVID-19 cases, coupled with the return of non-COVID-19 care utilization. I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished in 2020, and the strength and resiliency shown by our enterprise amidst the global pandemic. We met our financial commitments, delivered strong growth, and we stepped up as a business and through the commitment and compassion of our associates to support our members, partners, and communities when they needed us most to address the new increase in an urgent need. Our growth in 2020 was powered by strategic investments we\u2019ve made in recent years to streamline and simplify our business and enhance the member and customer experience. Membership trends in the year exceeded expectations on all fronts. Medical enrollment finished the year strong at 42.9 members representing growth of 1.9 million members over the prior year. We\u2019re pleased that our commercial business has continued to grow even in this challenging economic environment. In addition to the AmeriBen acquisition, growth has been fueled by strong customer retention and a steady pipeline of new accounts sales. In fact, sales in our large group risk business that outpaced lapses in 14 of the last 16 months, reflecting the market leading performance of our new virtual strategies and tools, as well as the benefit of our innovative products, such as Total Health, Total You and further integration of our pharmacy offerings from IngenioRx. Total commercial membership was flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in our risk-based group business offset by in-group change in our fee-based business as a result of the economic environment. Our risk-based business has been incredibly resilient as we\u2019ve deepened talent, enhanced our products and improved sales execution across our markets. In addition, sales of our large group\u2019s specialty dental and vision products outperformed 2019 results, demonstrating that employers value the affordability and simplicity of Anthem\u2019s integrated medical and specialty offerings, it\u2019s clear the actions we\u2019ve taken to focus on the consumer and their unique needs are garnering a strong market response. Medicaid membership grew by roughly 1.6 million consumers during the year and nearly, 300,000 lives in the fourth quarter, marked by strong organic growth aided by the pause on new verifications, and two strategic acquisitions in Nebraska and Missouri. Medicare Advantage membership ended the year of nearly 18% compared to 2019, continuing our meaningful growth in senior business. Our essential extra suite of benefit options are resonating with seniors as we saw greater than 300% increase in the selection of benefits, such as personal home helper services, transportation benefits, and access to personal home safety devices. We\u2019re pleased with our continued growth in this important segment for Anthem and the demonstrated resilience of our diversified portfolio. Our AEP performance is in line with expectations and we expect another year of double-digit growth, once again, outperforming the industry average growth rate. Over the past year, Anthem stepped up as we trusted health partner to support our stakeholders as they navigated the pandemic. We adapted and accelerated our digital innovations, enhanced our focus on community health, transformed many of our products and solutions, and simplified our processes in the context of COVID-19. We recognize our critical role in ensuring safe access to care and COVID-19 vaccinations, and have launched a nationwide partnership with Lyft to support universal access to vaccines. We are leveraging Anthem\u2019s local market strength, provider relationships and data assets in combination with this on demand transportation network to serve at-risk communities, disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Our goal is to provide 60 million free rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income uninsured and at-risk communities. Further, we recently launched a new online C-19 vaccine tracker to provide personalized vaccination insights for Anthem members. This web-based dashboard aggregates vaccine-related data from public and private sources to give consumers a real-time view of vaccine distribution progress and help to inform our members when they might be eligible to receive the vaccine. We recognize the increased social and health needs of our members and communities during this pandemic. With each of our Medicaid States, we\u2019re performing detailed community needs, assessments to create localized solutions with our partners to support issues with housing, job training, and free internet for underserved children. And our Medicare members are provided access to firm-based social workers to help coordinate local resources and services to support their needs around food and security, transportation and more. For members with complex conditions such as cancer receiving care has become even more difficult during this pandemic. in response, we\u2019ve launched Anthem\u2019s Concierge Cancer Care Program from diagnosis to recovery, members received personalized 24/7 guidance and support to live health online and remote monitoring technology with access to top-tier cancer facilities across the country. This unique program has more than tripled since its launch in 2020. It is now available to nearly 900,000 members. Throughout the course of this past year, our deeply committed associates have stepped up and shown great compassion and care to those who serve and to one another. With more than a 100,000 volunteers always will have in our local communities through in-person and virtual giving. Our associates have embodied our values and culture, reflecting the fabric of who we are. As we move into 2021, we will continue to modernize our business to drive growth efforts to transform our business are not new. And in fact, our focus was sharpened and investments accelerated, and why did the pandemic? Today, we are continuing to consolidate our systems automated and streamlined processes, and embedding digital and AI across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience and deepened engagement with all those we served. We've recognized the power of digital technologies to reach more of our stakeholders, particularly as part of our community health efforts; Kidney Health is personalizing care for consumers, helping to bridge gaps in care and improve outcomes for underserved populations. In fact, Kidney Health recently received several awards, including corporate insights, gold medal for virtual care, recognizing our ability to give members more options and how they engage with care providers, whether it be via chat, email, phone, or video, who are excited to be introduced in the first of its kind digital nutrition assistant. Through the use of AI, our food and nutrition app will be able to automatically recognize food and log meals and meal time, providing users with personalized information and progress on nutrition goals. This integrated tool is currently available to Anthem associates that will be available more broadly later this year to provide our members with a fully connected health and wellness experience. We know consumers are experiencing healthcare more digitally. So, we focused on creating greater access to care via telehealth, particularly in the behavioral health space with usage has gone up from single-digit pre-pandemic percentage levels to as much as 60% of all visits and that level has stayed consistent over the past four months. Our AI-based care finder is now live for all segments of our business and differentiates Anthem with a fully-integrated approach using predictive tool and AI to help guide members to the right care at the right time and place for them, which could mean via text, phone, video, in-personal chat. Additionally, through our AI-based predictive service and chat functionality, we were able to redirect five million member calls last year to on-demand digital channels, to provide members with information they needed quickly and efficiently. Today, we\u2019re delivering on consumer demands for simplicity and affordability, and we\u2019re helping to restore hope while making positive and sustainable change for our local communities grounded by our mission and driven by our purpose to improve the health of humanity. We move into 2021 with a bold agenda as we continue to grow and transform our business, and fundamentally improve the healthcare experience for those we serve. Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of greater than $24.50 reflects challenges unforeseen when we reported third quarter results, specifically adjusted net income guidance reflects the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which includes the one-year increase in Medicare physician rates as well as other COVID-19 related impacts on the Medicare business. All in, we estimate these items equate to a $0.50 to $0.70 net negative headwind. Importantly, these factors are transient and should diminish as we move into 2022. Looking ahead, we are poised to deliver membership growth of nearly 1.5 million members at the midpoint, driven predominantly by our risk-based businesses. our outlook reflects our ability to deliver solid enrollment growth despite the uncertainties in 2021. we remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term 12% to 15% earnings growth and look forward to our March 3rd virtual Investor Day. we will provide a more detailed look into our strategy, including the transformative digital and community health initiatives that are driving real growth across our business. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.54, down 35% year-over-year driven primarily by cost related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken to support our members. for the full year adjusted earnings per share was $22.48 representing growth of 16% over 2019. total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $31.5 billion, an increase of more than 16% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting solid growth in Medicaid and Medicare. for the full year, we ended 2020 serving 42.9 million members including growth of 300,000 lives during the fourth quarter. Medicaid membership was up more than 11 times the decline in our commercial risk-based business. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of membership growth, further demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business. for the full year, operating revenue grew over 17%. The fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 88.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the prior-year quarter. COVID-related costs accelerated during the quarter above expectations. However, this was offset by non-COVID utilization coming in lower than expectations. taken together, overall utilization was above baseline, albeit slightly better than expected. The SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 13.7%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior-year quarter due primarily to increased spending to support growth, including the efforts taken to modernize our business and become a more agile organization as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. on a HIF-adjusted basis, our SG&A ratio decreased 30 basis points, compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by double-digit growth in operating revenue. Full year 2020 operating cash flow was $10.7 billion or 2.3 times net income. fourth quarter operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. the increase is primarily attributable to changes in our net working capital and enrollment growth in our government businesses. Our operating cash flow in the fourth quarter benefited by a number of payments that were originally expected to be received in 2021. These early receipts along with other items that benefited 2020 cash flow, including payment deferrals allowed under the CARES Act. We will reverse in 2021 and negatively impact our 2021 operating cash flow metrics. We ended 2020 with a strong balance sheet as the debt-to-cap ratio was 38.7%, consistent with our target range. Days in claims payable was 43.4 days, an increase of 2.3 days sequentially and 5.4 days versus the prior year, along with the growth in medical claims payable of 28% compared to an increase in premium revenue of approximately 11%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares and a weighted average price of $305.66. In total, we repurchased $2.7 billion of stock in 2020, or 9.4 million shares. As a reminder, our original guidance contemplated share repurchase of $1.5 billion. after reinstating share repurchases in the second quarter, we accelerated the pace of share buyback in the second half of the year in response to market conditions. Turning to our 2021 outlook, our current guidance reflects our latest assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our guidance includes new items that were unknown at the time of our third quarter call, including the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the corresponding one year increase in Medicare physician payment rates and other COVID-related impacts on our Medicare business. In addition, the significant decline in non-COVID utilization in our Medicare business during the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll have an impact on our rich revenue by more than we had anticipated. all in, these items resulted in a net negative headwind of $0.50 to $0.70 per share, relative to the outlook we shared on our third quarter call. like 2020, 2021 presents its own set of the new challenges that we believe to be transient. our core business and underlying fundamentals remain strong, absent those new and unique circumstances. We remain confident that our long-term earnings growth target of 12% to 15% is both credible and sustainable. Turning to our 2021 guidance metrics. Total medical membership is expected to reach 44.4 million members at the midpoint, which reflects growth across our key business segments. In the commercial business, we project our risk-based enrollment in the year between 4.5 million to 4.6 million members. In our fee-based business during the year between 25.5 million and 25.7 million members. in our Medicaid business, we expect to end the year with approximately 10 million to 10.2 million lives, reflecting organic growth in our existing markets and the expectation that the re-verification process that remain on hold through the end of the year. In addition, our guidance also includes growth for North Carolina, which is expected to go wide later this year. In Medicare Advantage, we\u2019re projecting double-digit growth at the midpoint as we expect continued measured growth over the balance of 2021. Medicare supplement is expected to end the year between 950,000 and one million members, and our FEP business is expected to be flat to slightly down at 1.6 million members. with IngenioRx, now firmly embedded in our baseline, we expect 2021 operating revenue to be approximately $135.1 billion representing growth of 13.5% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 88% plus or minus 50 basis points, an increase of 120 basis points at the midpoint from 2019, which is the most recent year, in which the health insurer fee does not apply. The increase is largely driven by a mix of business, more heavily skewed to Medicaid and Medicare, and the impact of COVID including the recently announced increase in Medicare physician rates. The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 10.8% plus or minus 50 basis points, primarily due to growth and operating revenue. In addition to the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee and the benefit of modernization efforts, including systems consolidation and broader process automation. Looking below the line, we expect investment income to be $940 million, an interest expense of $785 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22% with the decrease primarily driven by the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Full-year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.7 billion. As a reminder, operating cash flow in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, as well as certain other receipts that were accelerated into 2020. absent the pull-through of those cash receipts, our 2021 operating cash flow will be roughly 1.1 times to 1.2 times net income. our long-term capital deployment targets are unchanged as we progress down this path of becoming the most innovative, valuable and inclusive partner in the healthcare ecosystem with the continued focus of delivering sustainable long-term shareholder returns. in terms of capital deployment, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 19% to $1.13 per share, bringing our dividend yield to roughly 1.4% and continuing our trend of annual dividend increases. We expect full-year share repurchase of at least $1.6 billion in our weighted average share count in the year in the range of 246 million to 248 million shares outstanding. As Gail mentioned, this past year presented its own unique set of challenges. And while much has changed, it is clear that we are still in the depths of a global pandemic. We remain committed to our mission of improving the lives and communities, which we serve, and we will continue to do our part in 2021 to meet the needs of our associates, members, customers, and healthcare providers as we persevere through this pandemic together. operator, we will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to see if you can walk through the $0.50 to $0.70 as much detail as possible. You mentioned the stimulus with a higher physician fee schedule and the quarterly sequestration. So, I estimated that at about $0.20. So, I was hoping you could break out \u2013 confirm that and then break out the other $0.40 in terms of rebuild locations and how that benefits Medicaid, the higher total costs of 20% add on the Medicaid rebates, et cetera. And then lastly, can we assume that when you think about the 2021 jump-off point for the 12% to 15% EPS growth next year. Would you grow off the $25.10 getting back with $0.50? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, justin and good morning. I appreciate the question and the opportunity to clarify the $0.50 to $0.70 change in our expectations. as you mentioned, with the appropriations bill and the extension of the federal health emergency, we now have a disconnect between some of the costs and the embellishments. We completely agree with their approach to the Medicare at 3.75% fee schedule rate increases as well as a sequestration. The Medicare rate increased for 12 months. The sequestration is only for three months is an offset, but there\u2019s a third component as well. And that\u2019s a 20% bump in the inpatient DRG is going to be extended for the full year, as well as part of the federal health emergency. So, when we take the three of those combined that actually accounts for about two thirds of the $0.50 to $0.70 differential that you\u2019re asking about. the other one third really relates to the fact that the non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter was lower than we had anticipated. And with the non-COVID utilization being lower than anticipated, we are unable to accurately capture all of the HCC codes to reflect our appropriate risk scores in our Medicare business. And so once you factor that in, that\u2019s about the other third. So, you take those out and we\u2019ll come down to the $25.10 that you have been modeling to the $24.50 at the midpoint. And then in terms of your question associated with the 2022 jump-off point, while it is premature to give 2022 guidance, it would be believed that many of these issues are transient and we\u2019re very comfortable affirming the 12% to 15% long-term sustainable growth rate on a $25.10 starting point. We always have the issue with COVID and rich revenues, and things could linger. And we will clearly be on top of that throughout the year. but as an outset, we\u2019re very comfortable with the $25.10 jump-off point. And thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you for the question, Justin. next question.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. I know there are a lot of puts and takes around this question, but right now, people are trying to make an assumption as to when there be mass distribution of the vaccine and when things might start to get back to normal. Conceptually, when you think about your 2021 guidance, how have you pegged that thinking, and if we were to find out, for example, if we say, you\u2019ve pegged it for the middle of the year or later in the year, if it happens, if there\u2019s variance say, it\u2019s in March or it\u2019s in October, would that \u2013 how would that change the financial outlook that the company\u2019s presenting?\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, Jeff \u2013 A.J., I\u2019m sorry. A great question and as you\u2019ve indicated, there is a lot of variability and assumptions. the most vulnerable populations, which include Medicare advantage members, et cetera and our expectation is by the end of the first quarter that they will achieve the vaccination level appropriate. We\u2019re really looking at having somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% of Americans vaccinated for the year. Medicare, we would expect to be a bit higher, the commercial population and the Medicaid population. We wouldn\u2019t expect the vaccines to be rolled out and complete it until the end of the summer. Maybe, even a little bit longer with the commercial population being close to the average for America for the year and then Medicaid being a little bit less. So, to the extent of the rollout and the efficacy of the vaccine, very clearly, could have an impact on the financial results for the year. As COVID costs go down when we do expect non-COVID utilization to increase. So, it\u2019s certainly not a one-for-one, but there\u2019s clearly a lot of dynamics associated with that modeling. And if the vaccine is either faster or slower, it\u2019ll have an impact in one direction or another. And hopefully, that helps.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And A.J., this is Gail Boudreaux. I think, in addition to John\u2019s question, as we shared, it is an incredibly dynamic environment relative to what\u2019s happening with COVID and the vaccine. As I shared in my opening comments, we are working very closely though, to try to ensure access for our members. We\u2019ve added a number of new tools in terms of the, our trackers and our online tool kit, ensure that people know where vaccines are available. We\u2019re going to work with our States closely. We entered a partnership with Lyft to provide 60 million free rides. Our sense is that the senior population, obviously, in the rollout is going to have first access to that. And then if each of the States make their determinations and supply becomes available, we\u2019ll be side-by-side, who their partners to ensure that, that we can be as efficient in helping as possible. So again, everything John said, I think, we are trying to model in this incredibly dynamic environment, but remain optimistic and supportive of what\u2019s happening and want to be a good partner to our States and our customers. So, thank you for the question, our next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays. your line is now open.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay, great. Thanks. Good morning, Gail and John. thanks for taking the question here. So, it\u2019s just in relation to those higher Medicare physician rates for 2021. If I was curious to hear more about the mechanics of this, just whether or not any of your capitated or at-risk payment arrangements with physicians would provide any sort of protection for Anthem again, impacts. And therefore, this might have greater impact on your fee for service arrangements with physicians, or is everything just indexed to the rate update and that doesn\u2019t really matter, but curious to hear more about the mechanics on that. Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. The amount that we\u2019ve disclosed in terms of the impact on our guidance, it\u2019s really the net amount regardless of the risk methodology; we have with the provider network. So certainly, in the capital [ph] arrangement, there is an impact as I had stated in the A.J\u2019s question, we also have the 20% bump in inpatient DRG. It\u2019s impacting all this as well, and then the sequestration offset. So, we got to take them all into consideration, look at how they play through the reimbursement methodologies and what we\u2019ve provided is the net impact of all those.\nSteven Valiquette: Okay.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Yes. Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. Question focused on the exchange business appears to competitive \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s always been competitive, but we\u2019re hearing some anecdotes and increased competition. How do you think about a dynamic in \u2013 specifically, how do you think about sort of, kind of like the margin goals that you have articulated in the past?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Ricky. I\u2019m going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads our commercial business to respond. Pete?\nPete Haytaian: Yes. thanks a lot for the question, Ricky. in terms of the individual business and sort of, as we see Q1 play out, we feel good about our strategy. We continue our thoughtful targeted approach and targeted growth approach in the individual business. We\u2019ve expanded into about 115 counties in 2021. Our approach continues to be based upon a focus on best-in-class economics, through value-based relationships, differentiated medical management, but really try to partner with key providers to enable excellence in quality and risk adjustment. And so that\u2019s been our grounding and we continue with that strategy. Overall this year, while we\u2019ll experience growth, environmental, and I think you\u2019re alluding to this. There is more competition. Also, there does appear to be less overall new sales across the federal facilitated marketplace and the state-based exchanges. It seems to be down a bit year-over-year. We believe that this is due to a variety of different factors. We all know that in several states, there were special election periods throughout 2020, which certainly, could have been a factor, also less overall government engagement and that could change with the Biden administration just in terms of overall marketing and then less prospect engagement, we saw that just in light of the political environment and the economic climate. but all that said as we look forward, we do remain optimistic regarding this business, the new administration, certainly, it looks like they\u2019re going to promote and pop up, excuse me, the ACA business. We just heard this week that we\u2019ll likely see an extension to open enrollment or special enrollment periods throughout the year, and then a possibility of more marketing and facilitated enrollment expenditures. So overall, I think we\u2019ll continue with our thoughtful approach, but with the new administration, I think there\u2019s an opportunity for further growth there.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And I would just add to Pete\u2019s comments that we\u2019ve had a very consistent strategy around the individual marketplace that really hasn\u2019t changed year-over-year. We\u2019ve done some expansion in States, where we obviously have a very deep footprint and we would continue to be opportunistic and very optimistic about what we think the opportunities are there. So, it\u2019s again, very consistent with what we shared with you in the last couple of years. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is now open.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get into the MLR guidance a little bit more, John, the 80% \u2013 maybe, you can give us some underlying assumptions, it does imply a step up and I know you mentioned mix. But even outside of that, it seemed a little bit higher. So hoping maybe, a sense of expectation of what you assumed in guidance around maybe, Local Group medical costs for 2021 and how we should consider that maybe off of either 2020, or maybe 2019. Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, Ralph for that question. and when we look at our MLR guidance, we certainly believe it\u2019s appropriate given the uncertainty around the timing and the efficacy of the vaccine rollout and the full-year impact of COVID, as well as those unexpected changes in Medicare physician rates and sequestration, timing mismatch that I talked about earlier, have obviously, all been incorporated in the 88%. But we\u2019re only looking at 2019 is the point of comparison since that was the last period that there was not a HIF. It\u2019s really; it\u2019s a fairly simple roll forward from that perspective. You look at the mix of the business that we have today with far more Medicaid members. We actually have had exceedingly strong growth in our Medicare advantage the last few years, being in the upper teens on a couple of year basis and exceeding the rest of the industry. All of that obviously changes our business mix. And just on a apples-to-apples basis, mix is driving about 60 basis points of the increase in the 2021 MLR versus the 2019 MLR. And then when we look at the impacts of COVID and there\u2019s a lot of things that go into COVID, there\u2019s certainly the cost of COVID, which is in the billions of dollars. There is non-COVID utilization impacts and in terms of, we believe that non-COVID utilization will be less than what a normal year would be in vacuum. And then of course, we had the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken into account for that, as well as our reimbursements from regulatory entities that we believe are appropriate in the COVID environment. When we take the net of all those, the impact of COVID is another 30 basis points to 50 basis points on our MLR for 2021. And there\u2019s a multitude of other small items going in both directions that may be comprised of last 10 basis points. but it\u2019s really, those two items, with mix in COVID. thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, John. You actually just covered everything that I was going to ask about the MLR and the COVID impact. I guess I would just say, one of your peers called out the COVID impact in Q4. I\u2019m wondering if you guys would be willing to do that. And then Gail, my follow-up is now that Ingenio was kind of fully stood up. Where do you see the white space in Anthem\u2019s offering going forward?\nJohn Gallina: Sure. I\u2019ll start with your question, George. and then and then turn it over to Gail. in terms of the COVID cost, I think really, probably, your question is what type of COVID costs are included in your guidance. And as I said, there\u2019s many factors and variables and so we\u2019ve spent considerable time analyzing and modeling potential impacts. A few of the peers, A.J. in particular, is asking, what happens with COVID vaccine with a lot of different concerns? Well, I\u2019ll tell you of all the modeling assumptions we have, the timing and efficacy of the vaccine is one of the assumptions that has the greatest amount of variability associated with it. But anyway all in, we\u2019re estimating that we have about a $600 million COVID headwind inherent in our 2021 guidance. And as I said, COVID costs when we include testing, treatment, vaccine administration, all the other things such as the Medicare fee schedules the sequestration, the various waves, it\u2019s several billions of dollars. but offsetting that is non-COVID utilization, less than a normal year, the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken in regulatory reimbursement and we\u2019ve been modeling all that and it\u2019s coming out to about $600 million. And you only think about that, think about our $24.50, and then you add $600 million to that, that puts us really at the high end or slightly above the high end of our 12% to 15% growth rate range that we\u2019ve talked about on a sustainable basis. So again, we do believe that a lot of these issues are transient. and there would probably be some lingering effects in the 2022. We feel very good about the underlying core business fundamentals that we have in the company. So, wit that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. thanks, John. And I just want to reiterate what John said in terms of just, we feel very good about these issues in our long-term EPS trajectory. And as you think about your question on IngenioRx; first of all, we\u2019re really pleased with the performance of IngenioRx has come in on our expectations. And I think that, we\u2019re past the transition and now, we\u2019re into know full integration of that business with our other opportunities. They think about it. IngenioRx, one of the areas this year, we had some nice sales and some real good throughput in integration with our commercial business, but it was impacted somewhat by the jumbo accounts, really not going out to market this past year. So, we would expect as we sell through 2021 that there\u2019s continuing an ongoing opportunity to integrate IngenioRx with our commercial footprint. And that\u2019s one of our biggest opportunities still. We still see a lot of runway for us to increase the penetration particularly, in our middle-sized and large accounts with integrated pharmacy benefit offerings. We did see some nice wins in 2021 on standalone business, which we\u2019re really, really happy with and we think that that\u2019s a big opportunities for to continue the impact on large accounts this year for just what\u2019s happening in the economy, I think is sort of depressed sales activity and movement, but we have very strong retention across both our commercial and our Ingenio books. So overall, we feel Ingenio is tracking very much aligned to our expectations and really, pleased with the performance of the business to-date. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to a lot of Kevin Fischbeck with bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I wanted to see what your guidance was including for two of the, I guess, things that might still be a little bit influx, as far as the Biden policies, I guess, first on the view about redeterminations or do you assume that they\u2019re going to come back this year or in fact not come back until next year. And the second, how you\u2019re thinking about testing costs, it sounds like you\u2019re including some testing costs in there. but I guess Biden\u2019s been talking about having insurers cover potentially back to work and back to school type testing, which it\u2019s not clear that companies weren\u2019t necessarily pricing to.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question. In terms of the sort of understanding inside of our guidance on the two issues reverification and testing. first, on reverification, we originally, I can share with you, our thoughts on where this year would come out. Our assumption was that the public health emergency would end in the first quarter that\u2019s what we knew at the time. but we also felt that Medicaid reverifications would probably really begin in the summer. So that was embedding our thinking. The other thing I think it\u2019s important to know is right now, we\u2019re assuming, based on the letter to governors that recently came out that reverifications will be on hold for all of 2021. But in our \u2013 even in our original assumptions, we never assumed that there will be cliff events and I think that\u2019s also an important assumption as you think about the progression of enrollment over the course of the year that law States were trying to understand their data and managing this, that given just the challenging conditions within each of these States that that would happen over time in the back half of the year. So again, as we think about this year, we\u2019re expecting no reverification \u2013 really, reverification to be on pause for the full year given sort of the initial guidance that\u2019s been given to governors. in terms of your second question, the policy issue on testing, we agree that testing is probably one of the most critical parts of controlling the spread of COVID, and we\u2019ve been strongly supportive of a wide availability of testing offerings and then it isn\u2019t unprecedented in terms of the situation, trying to understand the additional support for all types of testing and expanding that capacity and also finding it quite frankly, new, reliable, rapid, and inexpensive ways to do this. to think about our industry, health plan benefits have always traditionally covered medical tests as appropriate to diagnose and treat individuals that were ordered by a physician. This is consistent with long-held insurance practices or contracts, and quite frankly, federal guidance. And so as we think about workplace testing examples of that that have happened over, certainly drug testing or other traditional ways, employers have paid for that outside of the health benefit. And then similarly public health surveillance testing has traditionally been paid for by States and local health departments. So, those are \u2013 I mean, as we think about that we\u2019ve followed that consistent approach to testing and also gave you a sense of what we\u2019ve been under verification. So, thank you for that question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. We\u2019ve kind of hit on this from various different quantifiable angles around the MLR, et cetera. but just maybe, going back, conceptually, I think one of the biggest concerns investors have is the risks that as COVID subsides, there\u2019s a bolus of deferred utilization and/or that utilization might be a higher acuity as \u2013 if health conditions have progressed and worsened, because of deferred care. So, when we think in the line of business, where that impact seems to be \u2013 the deferred impact seems to be most significant throughout 2020, seems to be the Medicare business, where seniors have stayed away as much as they are able to. So, as we think about your sort of house view in 2021, how are you thinking about non-COVID utilization, whether there is really pent-up demand, not just getting back to normal and whether that acuity is higher, and is that view particularly any different for commercial Medicare or Medicaid.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the question, Gary. and as you can imagine when I discussed earlier, the extensive modern that we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s a lot of different thought processes around that. but conceptually, yes, we do believe that there is pent-up demand in the system, and we do believe that there\u2019s a chance as it could be higher acuity associated with when folks get care. And that\u2019s probably most pronounced in the Medicare line of business. So really, the question is not if those will happen, because we believe those will happen. The question is to what extent and how significant, and then you also have things like emergency room, Biden and we believe will remain low, and that the way that people access care will continue to change a bit in the future as it had in the past. To the extent that COVID stays high, and then we expect non-COVID utilization, whether it\u2019s the normal utilization pent-up demand or anything else to actually be below normal. to the extent that COVID subsides and the vaccine is extremely successful. We do expect that to go off, there\u2019s really clearly a natural hedge in there. I have talked in response to other questions about what the net impact is and we really don\u2019t want to talk about specifically, how much we have for each of those buckets, because you\u2019re so fungible and interchangeable, and they do hedge an offset each other. But yes, the promise of your question, we completely agree with that, we believe is that based on our various modeling sensitivities and understanding of our membership that we believe that the guidance we\u2019ve provided is very solid and very appropriate and prudent. and that we\u2019ll be able to manage through changes in either direction. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line Whit Mayo with UBS. Your line is now open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. I\u2019m just curious what you guys are sort of assuming and thinking about COVID cost sharing this year. Is there any change in how you approach that? should we anticipate continuing to waive co-pays for the entirety of the year? And one other question I have is just around the sequester that if it does get delayed for the balance of 2021, how \u2013 is there any way to maybe size the impact there?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Whit. As we think about, as we\u2019ve heard, actually on this call, it\u2019s an incredibly dynamic environment. in terms of cost shares, the part of the public health emergency we are waving right now, cost shares for testing and obviously, when the vaccine deployment comes in, those will all be included. as part of this environment, I think the biggest impact of cost shares is going to be in the first quarter, which we\u2019ve shared with you. we\u2019re assessing access to care and how all of that is happening across each of our businesses. So, from that perspective and what I would say is first quarter is really how you should be thinking about the biggest impact of cost share waivers. And again, because of all the impacts that are happening, it\u2019s pretty, pretty dynamic. And so we\u2019re reacting and making sure that we assess that on a real-time basis. In terms of the sequester, maybe, I\u2019ll ask John to comment on the sequester.\nJohn Gallina: Well, the \u2013 thank you. So, there\u2019s clearly a disconnect right now. So, say that sequestration versus the DRG bump in the Medicare rate increase of 3.75%. The issue really, is that what the extension of the federal health emergency, the DRG bump is going to be for the full year. We know that based on the Appropriations Act that the Medicare rate schedule is going to be for the full year and sequestrations only for the first 90 days. And unfortunately, that will require a legislative action in order to extend the sequestrations. So, we have not included an extension of that and our guidance at this point in time. That really helps. thanks for the question, Whit.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDave Windley: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You had \u2013 management had sized a $500 million number from Medicaid risk corridor or call-back, wondered if that turned out to be the $100 million that was going to fall in the fourth quarter, if that turned out to be an accurate assessment or if it was different than that and to what extent, are you viewing those call-backs are continuing into 2021. And then if I could slip in, the flu season is just extraordinarily, low apart from COVID and wondered if that has any impact on your thoughts or guidance for 2021? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thanks, Dave. appreciate the question. And get together, all of which knows a little bit of a frame of reference in terms of when I answer it. In terms of some of the Medicaid call-backs, et cetera, we had experienced about a $100 million in the first six months of the year, had about $300 million worth in the third quarter. And during the third quarter call was asked, what do you think the full year is going to be? And I said, probably, we expected to be a little bit more than a $0.5 billion, meaning that just over a $100 million in fourth quarter. While it turned out that it was more than that in the fourth quarter, there is almost $250 million in the fourth quarter and to make almost $650 million for the year. I think it\u2019s very important to note that even with that $650 million call-backs with all the various corridor and collar and other rate protections that existed within that block of business, that Medicaid still into 2020 within target margin ranges. In terms of the impacts for the future, we have about half of our Medicaid States are re-priced on January 1. We are very comfortable with the actuarial credibility of those rates thus far and believe that we will continue to work with our state partners, in terms of the challenges that they\u2019re facing, and they\u2019re respectful of their budget issues, but the still received rates that are actuary sound and actuary solid for 2021. And then there are rate protections, as I said, between collars, corridors, rebates, whatever you want to call them, they all have the same aspect to try to better align cost and revenue within the same timeframe in same period. So, we\u2019re actually very bullish about our ability here in Medicaid. And then in terms of the flu season, yes, they \u201ctypical flu season or influenza season is much less than anticipated.\u201d We\u2019ve factored that in; I\u2019ve talked about non-COVID utilization being less than normal in total for the year that is part of the calculus. So, we\u2019re actually thrilled with a lot of things that we did even; we took staff to ensure that our members had access to the flu vaccine through our fall through campaign. You may not know this, but Anthem partnered with over a 100 community-based organizations across our markets. And we stood up 500 pop-up and drive to clinics and insurance neighborhoods to promote and support higher immunization rates. And we believe some of our efforts help contribute to the lower than normal flu incidence. And as I said, that\u2019s all factored into the non-credit utilization comments that I made earlier. I appreciate the question, Dave. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Question is Anthem\u2019s strategy around working with physicians and health systems and risk-based arrangements. And if you could size the overall spend that you see going through risk-based contracts, and specifically, through global capitation.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. We\u2019ve shared this publicly a few times. We\u2019re a north of 60% in some type of \u2013 we\u2019ll call it, upside downside risk. So, what does that mean? It\u2019s a variety of relationships that we have, and we are moving to increase the much more capitated full risk arrangements, particularly in our government business. At this stage, a lot of them are gained shares. Although we do have a component of that 60% in full risk, our strategy is to continue to build upon that. And we believe that having one in eight patients in our markets that are Anthem patients across our book of business provides us a real foothold in those marketplaces and we\u2019ve been working with our care providers to improve that we started with the program was really based on primary care capitation and working with them on your share to get them more involved. So, our strategy does revolve around primary care. And we\u2019re going to continue to build on that. We have 180 accountable care organizations. 23% of those are roughly operating under shared risk arrangements as well. And then if you think about other innovation programs, you\u2019ve got about 69% of our medical spend tied to performance-based contracts as well. So, as you can see, this for us is evolving. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been working on for a number of years we\u2019ve had. the infrastructure in place to do it, and now, we\u2019re increasing and enhancing the amount of full risk that our care providers are taking with us. And we actually expect that to accelerate, because of the pandemic. We see an increased interest across our businesses and physicians working with us, and we find plenty of access in our markets. I mean, I think that\u2019s the question that\u2019s been asked before, is there enough capacity in our markets and we\u2019ve seen many of our physicians very willing to move along the continuum with us. So, it\u2019s a journey probably a few years still until we get to where we want to do. but ultimately, we make progress every year and it\u2019s a core part of our strategy. The other area that I just want to touch on is telehealth, which is another part of our strategy, not tied necessarily to behavioral health or not tied necessarily to risk-based payments, but we also see telehealth, tele-behavioral health, and in particular, a growing part of our strategy, I shared more than 50% of our visits and behavioral are done via telehealth. We think that\u2019s a great access. We also think bringing in quite frankly, not just physical health on the medical side, but behavioral health into these arrangements, and our pharmacy actually completes the circle for us. And then some of the capabilities within our Diversified Business Group around palliative care and the work that they\u2019re doing to make sure that we are being better positioned with data to help manage these relationships is another area that we\u2019ve been investing very heavily in. So, thanks for the question. It\u2019s a core part of our strategy. We\u2019re on a journey. We still have some work to do. but I think we\u2019ve made really good progress and continued to move down the risk corridors. So, thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Could you talk a little bit about your strategy, and partnering and cross-selling into other Blue Cross organizations, and in particular, could you hit three areas that it\u2019d just be interesting to understand the progress and the outlook for Ingenio, for our diversified in particular, the Beacon asset name, and then also your Medicaid partnerships? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you very much. I\u2019ll begin, and then I\u2019m going to ask Felicia to share some comments around our Medicaid partnerships. You hit really on the three key areas that we\u2019re partnering with our Blue, other Blue plans on, and even there\u2019s a couple of others. First, in terms of Ingenio, as you know, Blue Cross of Idaho is one of our first commercial partners in that space, and we just added their Medicare Advantage business on January 1st. We continue to work across Ingenio in addition to several other relationships that we\u2019ve had with other Blues; it\u2019s a longer-term sales process, because as you know, most of those contracts are three to five-year contracts. So, it takes some time. And we really, until this year, we\u2019re not in a position, I think with the transition and other things we\u2019re doing to take on most of those kinds of arrangements. So, we\u2019ve actually been very balanced in pacing the relationships that we\u2019ve had there, but we actually do think there\u2019s a really good opportunity for us to continue to build and expand. An area that you didn\u2019t talk about specifically was the relationship we have in the group Medicare business. We\u2019ve got some partnerships there also with other Blues that we think, will help us to expand our combined footprint. And we\u2019ve been working with Blue \u2013 our Blue partners on that, because we think we offer obviously, some capabilities in that space and we can work with them on their commercial business to convert that to group Medicare and we\u2019ve had some wins this year in that area as well. The last areas of the Diversified Business Group and Beacon\u2019s a great example. I mean, that asset that we purchased and brought onto the Anthem family in the last year, we see as a very big opportunity. They obviously have a large footprint even before integrating with Anthem. They work with a number of Blue partners. We consider that an opportunity to integrate our whole health strategy. And we see our Blue peer is also very interested in expanding there in addition, on the Diversified Business Group, we\u2019ve seen meaningful opportunities to expand CareMore and Aspire. Those are two other companies that have worked with Blue partners. And then we\u2019re in a joint venture on our integrated health consumer capabilities, which we\u2019ve talked about in terms of Total Health, Total You, and some of the other work that we\u2019re doing, because those awful \u2013 also offer opportunities. So, as you can see a lot of different things are happening. These are generally several year sales. So, I won\u2019t say that it\u2019s going to happen overnight, but we\u2019ve seen a real increase in the external business that we\u2019ve had in working with our group partners. Medicaid is the space that we started our partnerships with, and expanded that into Medicare and the duals. And I\u2019m going to ask Felicia maybe, to comment on that because that\u2019s probably been our longest standing relationships with our Blue partners.\nFelicia Norwood: Good morning, Lance and thank you for the question. Now, we\u2019re very pleased with our Blue partnerships. We started the year with five partnerships on the Blue side. We\u2019ve now added Nebraska and Missouri. Both branded as Healthy Blue. The opportunity that we have is that we\u2019re really a natural partner to our Blue plan, and see this is an opportunity for us to continue to leverage the breadth and scope of Anthem\u2019s deep knowledge around Medicaid execution, and being able to continue to grow that membership as we go forward. When you take a look at where we are today, the great opportunity since not from Medicaid, but also to Medicare, we were able to leverage our partnerships for example, that we had in Louisiana to move forward with the D-SNP offering and we\u2019re doing the same thing with our partnership in North Carolina as well. So, the future of our alliances and partnerships, it\u2019s strong, I think this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate the value that we bring across the board to our Blue partners and we\u2019ll continue to enhance that as we go forward. Gail also mentioned GRS and our opportunities there, and we were able to actually partner with independence Blue Cross for 1/1/2021 in terms of our partnership with them going forward. So, between Medicaid and Medicaid, the opportunity continues to be robust and we will continue to grow this business as we move forward.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. I think the summary of all that is we\u2019re making some good progress, we\u2019re in early days. And we do think that there\u2019s significant opportunity. but again, these pipelines take some time and we expect over the next several years to continue to advance this, but it\u2019s an important part of our overall growth strategy. So, thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nRobert Jones: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess maybe, just one on the SG&A expense ratio, the expectation for 10.8% plus or minus at the midpoint. I know there\u2019s the moving pieces this year. I was hoping John; maybe, give us a little context on the drivers of this. Obviously, we would have the SG&A ratio lower than what we saw this year. And I know we\u2019re thinking about the HIF and mix, and then just other cost initiatives. So, just any breakdown of that would be helpful. And then \u2013 and as it relates to the cadence of how we should be thinking about SG&A throughout the year would be helpful. Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. Our SG&A levels are decreasing and yes, they\u2019re really again, to be more consistent with the plans that we discussed at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. We continue to have systems migration strategies, looking very hard to eliminate non-value added work flows and really, enhancing our digital capabilities. Also, at the end of the third quarter of last year, we had some business optimization charges and you\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits of that already come through the P&L. So all in, we feel very good about that. We\u2019ve clearly seen significant revenue growth as well and our revenue growth is far exceeded our growth in SG&A expenses, which serves to lower the SG&A ratio. So, as you know, we\u2019re anticipating a lot of growth in Medicaid. Medicaid carries a lower SG&A ratio than the company does in general, in terms of mix and made an average. So, a lot of moving parts and a lot of factors, but we\u2019re very confident with our 10.8% and believe that it\u2019s very much delivering on the promises that we laid out a couple of years ago at Investor Day. So, thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens. Your line is open.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. I actually wanted to just ask about Diversified Business Group just more broadly in terms of thinking about the 2021 outlook, and interested, if you could maybe, talk about how you\u2019re thinking about revenue growth in margin profile for the business. I know there\u2019s a bunch of businesses within that. But generally more broadly, and then call out, any key COVID headwinds or tailwinds to consider around that segment? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Sure, Scott. Thank you for the question. Diversified Business Group is extremely important part of our long-term strategy and our long-term growth aspirations. It is not yet large enough to be considered a separate reporting segment under SEC reporting guidelines. So, there\u2019s only so much information there that we can provide on a detailed basis. But now in 2021, we do expect to see some nice growth on a specific, on a percentage basis out of Diversified Business Group. The aim is proactively managing capacity as volume returns and we continue to monitor volumes as utilization demand normalizes. The Beacon has initially experienced a reduction in utilization and then rebounded significant throughout the year. Once Beacon and once the vaccine stabilizes the COVID issue, we expect Beacon to really be a meaningful growth driver in that area here for the future. And our program integrity area is also \u2013 the SIU is also within DBG. And that\u2019s been impacted a little bit here in 2020 with the lower claims volume and they expect that to kick back up in 2021. So, there are both opportunities for DBG to further penetrate Anthem membership and do things appropriate to help bend the cost curve within Anthem and then sell that externally. Gail just talked to a minute ago about some of the opportunities that they have in DBG, and penetrating more and more of the Blues. So, we\u2019re very bullish about DBG\u2019s long-term aspirations and helping drive the overall growth of Anthem for the future.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And I\u2019d add to John, as I said, in my prior comments, the Diversified Business Group is, it\u2019s in the early stages. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019ve seen from it. We\u2019re very happy with Aspire and Beacon, especially because of the opportunities to integrate as part of our Whole Health strategy. We see big opportunities. We shared this at our last Investor Day about the impact that Diversified Business Group can have on Anthem\u2019s business to help accelerate our own growth and we\u2019re starting to see some of that already inside of the Anthem numbers, where both CareMore and Beacon, particularly this year really supported Anthem\u2019s growth. But as John said, similar to other health services business, COVID did have an impact on our ability to do in-house assessments and some of the utilization certainly was up in the Beacon behavioral health business. but overall, we\u2019re still very positive about the long-term growth projections of our Diversified Business Group. And we\u2019re going to share a lot more about where we see that going in our Investor Day in March. Thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes. I was just wondering if you could talk about the enrollment outlook for the beginning of the year, particularly, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of large accounts. I think you referenced less movement there this year, which isn\u2019t surprising. And then Medicare Advantage also how you see that coming into the New Year? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. I\u2019m going to ask for Pete to answer the commercial question and then Felicia about Medicare Advantage, but just a couple of overarching comments on that. Overall, we\u2019re really pleased with what \u2013 how our commercial business performed in 2020, just given the economic headwinds and as you saw, incredibly resilient business with most of our impacts, having a result of just the downsizing inside of accounts. but our sales have been robust and our retention good. but without stealing all of Pete, so let me turn it over to him to give a bit of a perspective and how we\u2019re seeing 2021 and then Felicia.\nPete Haytaian: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. I appreciate it. Just to reiterate what Gail said. We\u2019re really pleased at how we landed in 2020 and how the team performed. Overall, with all the headwinds we talked about in 2020, we actually saw the commercial book grow sequentially year-over-year. So that was great. And while we did see furloughs in our book of business and in less risky segments being a factor, as Gail just alluded to the execution was outstanding from the team. Our sales exceeded our lapses for this quarter again, and for nine of the last 12 months. That was great to see. And on the Local Group business side, we actually grew our fully insured and self-funded business in the quarter. So that really played out well. What you alluded to is what our headwind has been throughout the year? And that\u2019s really the in-group change dynamics that occurred in the larger size accounts. And that\u2019s really going to be the story for 2021, as it relates to our execution and how we\u2019re starting off the year in 2021. We still feel very good. We feel very good about our portfolio. but again, depending on the economy and how in-group change plays out of specialty upmarket, as you alluded to, will be a big factor as we head into 2021. If that changes and the economy improves quicker than we think, then that would be a positive obviously. But overall, we\u2019re taking a more conservative view of that in light of where the economy is today. And I\u2019d say that that would overall lend itself to about flattish overall membership growth in the commercial business.\nFelicia Norwood: And in terms of our Medicare business, Medicare Advantage, particularly, the results of the past AEP are in line with our expectations. And it\u2019s been referenced earlier in the call. We certainly expect another year of double-digit growth outperforming the industry average growth rate. As a reminder, our growth in Medicare Advantage has historically been more balanced throughout the year, rather than just limited to one-one. We\u2019re also pleased to be expanding our footprint into 109 new counties. And for the first time, we will be offering Medicare Advantage plans in Iowa, and state-wide across Kentucky and Tennessee as well. Our virtual sales comprise more than 60% of our total sales volume this past AEP and the results from our Care Guide is very promising. Care Guide provides our members with a new simplified orientation journey that begins at the point of sale and reduces number of touch points to ensure that they have consistency throughout the overall on-boarding process. And finally, with respect to group retiree, while there was a bit of a delay in the GRS pipeline, we still think that opportunity is intact and we expect to see more of these opportunities as we move into 2022 and beyond.\nGail Boudreaux: I\u2019d like to just really give a shout out to our teams in both the commercial and Medicare business, because this was really unusual year. We had a pivot and the investments that we made in our tools in our digital engagement with brokers, et cetera, really pay dividends across all of our businesses this year. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 that really speaks to the kind of investments that we\u2019re making to \u2013 that we can engage even when we\u2019re not able to be in-person with our clients from a sales and account management perspective. So again, overall 2020, I felt our teams really responded well, and we\u2019re looking forward to 2021. We\u2019ve learned a lot. And I think the investments we\u2019ve made, have really helped us support our clients in this environment. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.\nSteve Willoughby: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Most of mine have been asked, but two things for you. One just to follow up on the last question, I was wondering if maybe, Felicia could comment at all as it related to Medicare Advantage between individual and group. And then Gail, I was wondering if you have any thoughts or have seen any impact on the National Accounts market as a result of the Blue Cross Blue Shield lawsuit and subsequent resolution and any rule changes with Blue Cross Blue Shield Association?\nFelicia Norwood: Thank you, Steve. As I referenced earlier, our individual sales for AEP were in line with our expectations, and the team certainly had to pivot in light of what we were seeing in the pandemic that led to more virtual sales. this AEP and results there were strong as well. So certainly, when we take a look at where we are. We are very pleased with what we saw and expect to deliver the double-digit growth that we referenced. From a group perspective, group membership came in well. I would say that, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, there were some delayed decisions from employers with respect to group retiree business for 2021. We expect that pipeline though remains intact. As we\u2019ve said before, when we take a look at our group business, we really have an inherent captive pipeline between the commercial business that we have, and our ability to be able to penetrate that business and grow as we go forward. So, while there was a real deferral, I think in some respects with respect to growth in group this year, we expect those opportunities to remain intact, and just were delayed and pushed out to 2022 and beyond.\nGail Boudreaux: And in terms of the last question about the MDL and the subscriber settlement. I commented on that on the third quarter call and really, it remains the same. I don\u2019t really see that changing our strategies. We talked a lot about the partnerships we have. in terms of National Accounts, we\u2019re going to continue to be an active participant in that market as our peer. So other \u2013 in terms of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of litigation and MDL, I really don\u2019t see anything different than what I shared on the third quarter call.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thank you very much. That will be our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. As you\u2019ve heard here today, Anthem delivered strong results in 2020, and we\u2019re well positioned moving into 2021 despite the ongoing uncertainties. We\u2019re a very different company than we were even one year ago. And I\u2019m optimistic about the opportunities for more than 70,000 associates to further improve the overall health of our members and communities during these challenging times. I look forward to speaking with you at our Investor Day event in March. Thank you again, for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 AM today through November 27, 2021.

            "content": "Yes. thanks a lot for the question, Ricky. in terms of the individual business and sort of, as we see Q1 play out, we feel good about our strategy. We continue our thoughtful targeted approach and targeted growth approach in the individual business. We've expanded into about 115 counties in 2021. Our approach continues to be based upon a focus on best-in-class economics, through value-based relationships, differentiated medical management, but really try to partner with key providers to enable excellence in quality and risk adjustment. And so that's been our grounding and we continue with that strategy. Overall this year, while we'll experience growth, environmental, and I think you're alluding to this. There is more competition. Also, there does appear to be less overall new sales across the federal facilitated marketplace and the state-based exchanges. It seems to be down a bit year-over-year. We believe that this is due to a variety of different factors. We all know that in several states, there were special election periods throughout 2020, which certainly, could have been a factor, also less overall government engagement and that could change with the Biden administration just in terms of overall marketing and then less prospect engagement, we saw that just in light of the political environment and the economic climate. but all that said as we look forward, we do remain optimistic regarding this business, the new administration, certainly, it looks like they're going to promote and pop up, excuse me, the ACA business. We just heard this week that we'll likely see an extension to open enrollment or special enrollment periods throughout the year, and then a possibility of more marketing and facilitated enrollment expenditures. So overall, I think we'll continue with our thoughtful approach, but with the new administration, I think there's an opportunity for further growth there. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question. I appreciate it. Just to reiterate what Gail said. We're really pleased at how we landed in 2020 and how the team performed. Overall, with all the headwinds we talked about in 2020, we actually saw the commercial book grow sequentially year-over-year. So that was great. And while we did see furloughs in our book of business and in less risky segments being a factor, as Gail just alluded to the execution was outstanding from the team. Our sales exceeded our lapses for this quarter again, and for nine of the last 12 months. That was great to see. And on the Local Group business side, we actually grew our fully insured and self-funded business in the quarter. So that really played out well. What you alluded to is what our headwind has been throughout the year? And that's really the in-group change dynamics that occurred in the larger size accounts. And that's really going to be the story for 2021, as it relates to our execution and how we're starting off the year in 2021. We still feel very good. We feel very good about our portfolio. but again, depending on the economy and how in-group change plays out of specialty upmarket, as you alluded to, will be a big factor as we head into 2021. If that changes and the economy improves quicker than we think, then that would be a positive obviously. But overall, we're taking a more conservative view of that in light of where the economy is today. And I'd say that that would overall lend itself to about flattish overall membership growth in the commercial business."

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. Despite a year challenged by COVID-19 and significant economic uncertainty, we delivered strong growth across all of our businesses. This morning, Anthem reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $2.19 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.54. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $17.98 and adjusted earnings per share of $22.48. Our full-year results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19 treatment costs and more normal utilization patterns in the second half of the year. Consistent with our expectations, fourth quarter utilization was above baseline, reflecting higher costs attributable to the recent surge of COVID-19 cases, coupled with the return of non-COVID-19 care utilization. I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished in 2020, and the strength and resiliency shown by our enterprise amidst the global pandemic. We met our financial commitments, delivered strong growth, and we stepped up as a business and through the commitment and compassion of our associates to support our members, partners, and communities when they needed us most to address the new increase in an urgent need. Our growth in 2020 was powered by strategic investments we've made in recent years to streamline and simplify our business and enhance the member and customer experience. Membership trends in the year exceeded expectations on all fronts. Medical enrollment finished the year strong at 42.9 members representing growth of 1.9 million members over the prior year. We're pleased that our commercial business has continued to grow even in this challenging economic environment. In addition to the AmeriBen acquisition, growth has been fueled by strong customer retention and a steady pipeline of new accounts sales. In fact, sales in our large group risk business that outpaced lapses in 14 of the last 16 months, reflecting the market leading performance of our new virtual strategies and tools, as well as the benefit of our innovative products, such as Total Health, Total You and further integration of our pharmacy offerings from IngenioRx. Total commercial membership was flat sequentially in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in our risk-based group business offset by in-group change in our fee-based business as a result of the economic environment. Our risk-based business has been incredibly resilient as we've deepened talent, enhanced our products and improved sales execution across our markets. In addition, sales of our large group's specialty dental and vision products outperformed 2019 results, demonstrating that employers value the affordability and simplicity of Anthem's integrated medical and specialty offerings, it's clear the actions we've taken to focus on the consumer and their unique needs are garnering a strong market response. Medicaid membership grew by roughly 1.6 million consumers during the year and nearly, 300,000 lives in the fourth quarter, marked by strong organic growth aided by the pause on new verifications, and two strategic acquisitions in Nebraska and Missouri. Medicare Advantage membership ended the year of nearly 18% compared to 2019, continuing our meaningful growth in senior business. Our essential extra suite of benefit options are resonating with seniors as we saw greater than 300% increase in the selection of benefits, such as personal home helper services, transportation benefits, and access to personal home safety devices. We're pleased with our continued growth in this important segment for Anthem and the demonstrated resilience of our diversified portfolio. Our AEP performance is in line with expectations and we expect another year of double-digit growth, once again, outperforming the industry average growth rate. Over the past year, Anthem stepped up as we trusted health partner to support our stakeholders as they navigated the pandemic. We adapted and accelerated our digital innovations, enhanced our focus on community health, transformed many of our products and solutions, and simplified our processes in the context of COVID-19. We recognize our critical role in ensuring safe access to care and COVID-19 vaccinations, and have launched a nationwide partnership with Lyft to support universal access to vaccines. We are leveraging Anthem's local market strength, provider relationships and data assets in combination with this on demand transportation network to serve at-risk communities, disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Our goal is to provide 60 million free rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income uninsured and at-risk communities. Further, we recently launched a new online C-19 vaccine tracker to provide personalized vaccination insights for Anthem members. This web-based dashboard aggregates vaccine-related data from public and private sources to give consumers a real-time view of vaccine distribution progress and help to inform our members when they might be eligible to receive the vaccine. We recognize the increased social and health needs of our members and communities during this pandemic. With each of our Medicaid States, we're performing detailed community needs, assessments to create localized solutions with our partners to support issues with housing, job training, and free internet for underserved children. And our Medicare members are provided access to firm-based social workers to help coordinate local resources and services to support their needs around food and security, transportation and more. For members with complex conditions such as cancer receiving care has become even more difficult during this pandemic. in response, we've launched Anthem's Concierge Cancer Care Program from diagnosis to recovery, members received personalized 24/7 guidance and support to live health online and remote monitoring technology with access to top-tier cancer facilities across the country. This unique program has more than tripled since its launch in 2020. It is now available to nearly 900,000 members. Throughout the course of this past year, our deeply committed associates have stepped up and shown great compassion and care to those who serve and to one another. With more than a 100,000 volunteers always will have in our local communities through in-person and virtual giving. Our associates have embodied our values and culture, reflecting the fabric of who we are. As we move into 2021, we will continue to modernize our business to drive growth efforts to transform our business are not new. And in fact, our focus was sharpened and investments accelerated, and why did the pandemic? Today, we are continuing to consolidate our systems automated and streamlined processes, and embedding digital and AI across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience and deepened engagement with all those we served. We've recognized the power of digital technologies to reach more of our stakeholders, particularly as part of our community health efforts; Kidney Health is personalizing care for consumers, helping to bridge gaps in care and improve outcomes for underserved populations. In fact, Kidney Health recently received several awards, including corporate insights, gold medal for virtual care, recognizing our ability to give members more options and how they engage with care providers, whether it be via chat, email, phone, or video, who are excited to be introduced in the first of its kind digital nutrition assistant. Through the use of AI, our food and nutrition app will be able to automatically recognize food and log meals and meal time, providing users with personalized information and progress on nutrition goals. This integrated tool is currently available to Anthem associates that will be available more broadly later this year to provide our members with a fully connected health and wellness experience. We know consumers are experiencing healthcare more digitally. So, we focused on creating greater access to care via telehealth, particularly in the behavioral health space with usage has gone up from single-digit pre-pandemic percentage levels to as much as 60% of all visits and that level has stayed consistent over the past four months. Our AI-based care finder is now live for all segments of our business and differentiates Anthem with a fully-integrated approach using predictive tool and AI to help guide members to the right care at the right time and place for them, which could mean via text, phone, video, in-personal chat. Additionally, through our AI-based predictive service and chat functionality, we were able to redirect five million member calls last year to on-demand digital channels, to provide members with information they needed quickly and efficiently. Today, we're delivering on consumer demands for simplicity and affordability, and we're helping to restore hope while making positive and sustainable change for our local communities grounded by our mission and driven by our purpose to improve the health of humanity. We move into 2021 with a bold agenda as we continue to grow and transform our business, and fundamentally improve the healthcare experience for those we serve. Our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance of greater than $24.50 reflects challenges unforeseen when we reported third quarter results, specifically adjusted net income guidance reflects the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, which includes the one-year increase in Medicare physician rates as well as other COVID-19 related impacts on the Medicare business. All in, we estimate these items equate to a $0.50 to $0.70 net negative headwind. Importantly, these factors are transient and should diminish as we move into 2022. Looking ahead, we are poised to deliver membership growth of nearly 1.5 million members at the midpoint, driven predominantly by our risk-based businesses. our outlook reflects our ability to deliver solid enrollment growth despite the uncertainties in 2021. we remain confident in our ability to achieve long-term 12% to 15% earnings growth and look forward to our March 3rd virtual Investor Day. we will provide a more detailed look into our strategy, including the transformative digital and community health initiatives that are driving real growth across our business. And now, I'll turn it over to John Gallina for a detailed look at our performance numbers. John? Thank you for the question, Justin. next question. Yes. And A.J., this is Gail Boudreaux. I think, in addition to John's question, as we shared, it is an incredibly dynamic environment relative to what's happening with COVID and the vaccine. As I shared in my opening comments, we are working very closely though, to try to ensure access for our members. We've added a number of new tools in terms of the, our trackers and our online tool kit, ensure that people know where vaccines are available. We're going to work with our States closely. We entered a partnership with Lyft to provide 60 million free rides. Our sense is that the senior population, obviously, in the rollout is going to have first access to that. And then if each of the States make their determinations and supply becomes available, we'll be side-by-side, who their partners to ensure that, that we can be as efficient in helping as possible. So again, everything John said, I think, we are trying to model in this incredibly dynamic environment, but remain optimistic and supportive of what's happening and want to be a good partner to our States and our customers. So, thank you for the question, our next question, please. Thank you. Next question, please. Thanks for the question, Ricky. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads our commercial business to respond. Pete? Yes. And I would just add to Pete's comments that we've had a very consistent strategy around the individual marketplace that really hasn't changed year-over-year. We've done some expansion in States, where we obviously have a very deep footprint and we would continue to be opportunistic and very optimistic about what we think the opportunities are there. So, it's again, very consistent with what we shared with you in the last couple of years. Next question, please. Next question, please. Yes. thanks, John. And I just want to reiterate what John said in terms of just, we feel very good about these issues in our long-term EPS trajectory. And as you think about your question on IngenioRx; first of all, we're really pleased with the performance of IngenioRx has come in on our expectations. And I think that, we're past the transition and now, we're into know full integration of that business with our other opportunities. They think about it. IngenioRx, one of the areas this year, we had some nice sales and some real good throughput in integration with our commercial business, but it was impacted somewhat by the jumbo accounts, really not going out to market this past year. So, we would expect as we sell through 2021 that there's continuing an ongoing opportunity to integrate IngenioRx with our commercial footprint. And that's one of our biggest opportunities still. We still see a lot of runway for us to increase the penetration particularly, in our middle-sized and large accounts with integrated pharmacy benefit offerings. We did see some nice wins in 2021 on standalone business, which we're really, really happy with and we think that that's a big opportunities for to continue the impact on large accounts this year for just what's happening in the economy, I think is sort of depressed sales activity and movement, but we have very strong retention across both our commercial and our Ingenio books. So overall, we feel Ingenio is tracking very much aligned to our expectations and really, pleased with the performance of the business to-date. Next question, please. Yes. Thanks for the question. In terms of the sort of understanding inside of our guidance on the two issues reverification and testing. first, on reverification, we originally, I can share with you, our thoughts on where this year would come out. Our assumption was that the public health emergency would end in the first quarter that's what we knew at the time. but we also felt that Medicaid reverifications would probably really begin in the summer. So that was embedding our thinking. The other thing I think it's important to know is right now, we're assuming, based on the letter to governors that recently came out that reverifications will be on hold for all of 2021. But in our \u2013 even in our original assumptions, we never assumed that there will be cliff events and I think that's also an important assumption as you think about the progression of enrollment over the course of the year that law States were trying to understand their data and managing this, that given just the challenging conditions within each of these States that that would happen over time in the back half of the year. So again, as we think about this year, we're expecting no reverification \u2013 really, reverification to be on pause for the full year given sort of the initial guidance that's been given to governors. in terms of your second question, the policy issue on testing, we agree that testing is probably one of the most critical parts of controlling the spread of COVID, and we've been strongly supportive of a wide availability of testing offerings and then it isn't unprecedented in terms of the situation, trying to understand the additional support for all types of testing and expanding that capacity and also finding it quite frankly, new, reliable, rapid, and inexpensive ways to do this. to think about our industry, health plan benefits have always traditionally covered medical tests as appropriate to diagnose and treat individuals that were ordered by a physician. This is consistent with long-held insurance practices or contracts, and quite frankly, federal guidance. And so as we think about workplace testing examples of that that have happened over, certainly drug testing or other traditional ways, employers have paid for that outside of the health benefit. And then similarly public health surveillance testing has traditionally been paid for by States and local health departments. So, those are \u2013 I mean, as we think about that we've followed that consistent approach to testing and also gave you a sense of what we've been under verification. So, thank you for that question. Next question, please. Next question, please. Thanks for the question, Whit. As we think about, as we've heard, actually on this call, it's an incredibly dynamic environment. in terms of cost shares, the part of the public health emergency we are waving right now, cost shares for testing and obviously, when the vaccine deployment comes in, those will all be included. as part of this environment, I think the biggest impact of cost shares is going to be in the first quarter, which we've shared with you. we're assessing access to care and how all of that is happening across each of our businesses. So, from that perspective and what I would say is first quarter is really how you should be thinking about the biggest impact of cost share waivers. And again, because of all the impacts that are happening, it's pretty, pretty dynamic. And so we're reacting and making sure that we assess that on a real-time basis. In terms of the sequester, maybe, I'll ask John to comment on the sequester. Next question, please. Next question, please. Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. We've shared this publicly a few times. We're a north of 60% in some type of \u2013 we'll call it, upside downside risk. So, what does that mean? It's a variety of relationships that we have, and we are moving to increase the much more capitated full risk arrangements, particularly in our government business. At this stage, a lot of them are gained shares. Although we do have a component of that 60% in full risk, our strategy is to continue to build upon that. And we believe that having one in eight patients in our markets that are Anthem patients across our book of business provides us a real foothold in those marketplaces and we've been working with our care providers to improve that we started with the program was really based on primary care capitation and working with them on your share to get them more involved. So, our strategy does revolve around primary care. And we're going to continue to build on that. We have 180 accountable care organizations. 23% of those are roughly operating under shared risk arrangements as well. And then if you think about other innovation programs, you've got about 69% of our medical spend tied to performance-based contracts as well. So, as you can see, this for us is evolving. It's something that we've been working on for a number of years we've had. the infrastructure in place to do it, and now, we're increasing and enhancing the amount of full risk that our care providers are taking with us. And we actually expect that to accelerate, because of the pandemic. We see an increased interest across our businesses and physicians working with us, and we find plenty of access in our markets. I mean, I think that's the question that's been asked before, is there enough capacity in our markets and we've seen many of our physicians very willing to move along the continuum with us. So, it's a journey probably a few years still until we get to where we want to do. but ultimately, we make progress every year and it's a core part of our strategy. The other area that I just want to touch on is telehealth, which is another part of our strategy, not tied necessarily to behavioral health or not tied necessarily to risk-based payments, but we also see telehealth, tele-behavioral health, and in particular, a growing part of our strategy, I shared more than 50% of our visits and behavioral are done via telehealth. We think that's a great access. We also think bringing in quite frankly, not just physical health on the medical side, but behavioral health into these arrangements, and our pharmacy actually completes the circle for us. And then some of the capabilities within our Diversified Business Group around palliative care and the work that they're doing to make sure that we are being better positioned with data to help manage these relationships is another area that we've been investing very heavily in. So, thanks for the question. It's a core part of our strategy. We're on a journey. We still have some work to do. but I think we've made really good progress and continued to move down the risk corridors. So, thank you. Next question. Thank you very much. I'll begin, and then I'm going to ask Felicia to share some comments around our Medicaid partnerships. You hit really on the three key areas that we're partnering with our Blue, other Blue plans on, and even there's a couple of others. First, in terms of Ingenio, as you know, Blue Cross of Idaho is one of our first commercial partners in that space, and we just added their Medicare Advantage business on January 1st. We continue to work across Ingenio in addition to several other relationships that we've had with other Blues; it's a longer-term sales process, because as you know, most of those contracts are three to five-year contracts. So, it takes some time. And we really, until this year, we're not in a position, I think with the transition and other things we're doing to take on most of those kinds of arrangements. So, we've actually been very balanced in pacing the relationships that we've had there, but we actually do think there's a really good opportunity for us to continue to build and expand. An area that you didn't talk about specifically was the relationship we have in the group Medicare business. We've got some partnerships there also with other Blues that we think, will help us to expand our combined footprint. And we've been working with Blue \u2013 our Blue partners on that, because we think we offer obviously, some capabilities in that space and we can work with them on their commercial business to convert that to group Medicare and we've had some wins this year in that area as well. The last areas of the Diversified Business Group and Beacon's a great example. I mean, that asset that we purchased and brought onto the Anthem family in the last year, we see as a very big opportunity. They obviously have a large footprint even before integrating with Anthem. They work with a number of Blue partners. We consider that an opportunity to integrate our whole health strategy. And we see our Blue peer is also very interested in expanding there in addition, on the Diversified Business Group, we've seen meaningful opportunities to expand CareMore and Aspire. Those are two other companies that have worked with Blue partners. And then we're in a joint venture on our integrated health consumer capabilities, which we've talked about in terms of Total Health, Total You, and some of the other work that we're doing, because those awful \u2013 also offer opportunities. So, as you can see a lot of different things are happening. These are generally several year sales. So, I won't say that it's going to happen overnight, but we've seen a real increase in the external business that we've had in working with our group partners. Medicaid is the space that we started our partnerships with, and expanded that into Medicare and the duals. And I'm going to ask Felicia maybe, to comment on that because that's probably been our longest standing relationships with our Blue partners. Yes. I think the summary of all that is we're making some good progress, we're in early days. And we do think that there's significant opportunity. but again, these pipelines take some time and we expect over the next several years to continue to advance this, but it's an important part of our overall growth strategy. So, thank you for the question. Next question, please. Next question. Yes. And I'd add to John, as I said, in my prior comments, the Diversified Business Group is, it's in the early stages. We're really pleased with the growth that we've seen from it. We're very happy with Aspire and Beacon, especially because of the opportunities to integrate as part of our Whole Health strategy. We see big opportunities. We shared this at our last Investor Day about the impact that Diversified Business Group can have on Anthem's business to help accelerate our own growth and we're starting to see some of that already inside of the Anthem numbers, where both CareMore and Beacon, particularly this year really supported Anthem's growth. But as John said, similar to other health services business, COVID did have an impact on our ability to do in-house assessments and some of the utilization certainly was up in the Beacon behavioral health business. but overall, we're still very positive about the long-term growth projections of our Diversified Business Group. And we're going to share a lot more about where we see that going in our Investor Day in March. Thank you for the question. Next question, please. Sure. I'm going to ask for Pete to answer the commercial question and then Felicia about Medicare Advantage, but just a couple of overarching comments on that. Overall, we're really pleased with what \u2013 how our commercial business performed in 2020, just given the economic headwinds and as you saw, incredibly resilient business with most of our impacts, having a result of just the downsizing inside of accounts. but our sales have been robust and our retention good. but without stealing all of Pete, so let me turn it over to him to give a bit of a perspective and how we're seeing 2021 and then Felicia. I'd like to just really give a shout out to our teams in both the commercial and Medicare business, because this was really unusual year. We had a pivot and the investments that we made in our tools in our digital engagement with brokers, et cetera, really pay dividends across all of our businesses this year. And I think that's \u2013 that really speaks to the kind of investments that we're making to \u2013 that we can engage even when we're not able to be in-person with our clients from a sales and account management perspective. So again, overall 2020, I felt our teams really responded well, and we're looking forward to 2021. We've learned a lot. And I think the investments we've made, have really helped us support our clients in this environment. Next question, please. And in terms of the last question about the MDL and the subscriber settlement. I commented on that on the third quarter call and really, it remains the same. I don't really see that changing our strategies. We talked a lot about the partnerships we have. in terms of National Accounts, we're going to continue to be an active participant in that market as our peer. So other \u2013 in terms of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of litigation and MDL, I really don't see anything different than what I shared on the third quarter call. Well, thank you very much. That will be our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining our call this morning. As you've heard here today, Anthem delivered strong results in 2020, and we're well positioned moving into 2021 despite the ongoing uncertainties. We're a very different company than we were even one year ago. And I'm optimistic about the opportunities for more than 70,000 associates to further improve the overall health of our members and communities during these challenging times. I look forward to speaking with you at our Investor Day event in March. Thank you again, for joining us."

            "content": "Good morning, Lance and thank you for the question. Now, we're very pleased with our Blue partnerships. We started the year with five partnerships on the Blue side. We've now added Nebraska and Missouri. Both branded as Healthy Blue. The opportunity that we have is that we're really a natural partner to our Blue plan, and see this is an opportunity for us to continue to leverage the breadth and scope of Anthem's deep knowledge around Medicaid execution, and being able to continue to grow that membership as we go forward. When you take a look at where we are today, the great opportunity since not from Medicaid, but also to Medicare, we were able to leverage our partnerships for example, that we had in Louisiana to move forward with the D-SNP offering and we're doing the same thing with our partnership in North Carolina as well. So, the future of our alliances and partnerships, it's strong, I think this is an opportunity for us to demonstrate the value that we bring across the board to our Blue partners and we'll continue to enhance that as we go forward. Gail also mentioned GRS and our opportunities there, and we were able to actually partner with independence Blue Cross for 1/1/2021 in terms of our partnership with them going forward. So, between Medicaid and Medicaid, the opportunity continues to be robust and we will continue to grow this business as we move forward. And in terms of our Medicare business, Medicare Advantage, particularly, the results of the past AEP are in line with our expectations. And it's been referenced earlier in the call. We certainly expect another year of double-digit growth outperforming the industry average growth rate. As a reminder, our growth in Medicare Advantage has historically been more balanced throughout the year, rather than just limited to one-one. We're also pleased to be expanding our footprint into 109 new counties. And for the first time, we will be offering Medicare Advantage plans in Iowa, and state-wide across Kentucky and Tennessee as well. Our virtual sales comprise more than 60% of our total sales volume this past AEP and the results from our Care Guide is very promising. Care Guide provides our members with a new simplified orientation journey that begins at the point of sale and reduces number of touch points to ensure that they have consistency throughout the overall on-boarding process. And finally, with respect to group retiree, while there was a bit of a delay in the GRS pipeline, we still think that opportunity is intact and we expect to see more of these opportunities as we move into 2022 and beyond. Thank you, Steve. As I referenced earlier, our individual sales for AEP were in line with our expectations, and the team certainly had to pivot in light of what we were seeing in the pandemic that led to more virtual sales. this AEP and results there were strong as well. So certainly, when we take a look at where we are. We are very pleased with what we saw and expect to deliver the double-digit growth that we referenced. From a group perspective, group membership came in well. I would say that, as we've mentioned before, there were some delayed decisions from employers with respect to group retiree business for 2021. We expect that pipeline though remains intact. As we've said before, when we take a look at our group business, we really have an inherent captive pipeline between the commercial business that we have, and our ability to be able to penetrate that business and grow as we go forward. So, while there was a real deferral, I think in some respects with respect to growth in group this year, we expect those opportunities to remain intact, and just were delayed and pushed out to 2022 and beyond."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail stated, we are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.54, down 35% year-over-year driven primarily by cost related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken to support our members. for the full year adjusted earnings per share was $22.48 representing growth of 16% over 2019. total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $31.5 billion, an increase of more than 16% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting solid growth in Medicaid and Medicare. for the full year, we ended 2020 serving 42.9 million members including growth of 300,000 lives during the fourth quarter. Medicaid membership was up more than 11 times the decline in our commercial risk-based business. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of membership growth, further demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business. for the full year, operating revenue grew over 17%. The fourth quarter medical loss ratio was 88.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the prior-year quarter. COVID-related costs accelerated during the quarter above expectations. However, this was offset by non-COVID utilization coming in lower than expectations. taken together, overall utilization was above baseline, albeit slightly better than expected. The SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 13.7%, an increase of 80 basis points over the prior-year quarter due primarily to increased spending to support growth, including the efforts taken to modernize our business and become a more agile organization as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. on a HIF-adjusted basis, our SG&A ratio decreased 30 basis points, compared to the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by double-digit growth in operating revenue. Full year 2020 operating cash flow was $10.7 billion or 2.3 times net income. fourth quarter operating cash flow was $3.8 billion, compared to $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. the increase is primarily attributable to changes in our net working capital and enrollment growth in our government businesses. Our operating cash flow in the fourth quarter benefited by a number of payments that were originally expected to be received in 2021. These early receipts along with other items that benefited 2020 cash flow, including payment deferrals allowed under the CARES Act. We will reverse in 2021 and negatively impact our 2021 operating cash flow metrics. We ended 2020 with a strong balance sheet as the debt-to-cap ratio was 38.7%, consistent with our target range. Days in claims payable was 43.4 days, an increase of 2.3 days sequentially and 5.4 days versus the prior year, along with the growth in medical claims payable of 28% compared to an increase in premium revenue of approximately 11%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 4.4 million shares and a weighted average price of $305.66. In total, we repurchased $2.7 billion of stock in 2020, or 9.4 million shares. As a reminder, our original guidance contemplated share repurchase of $1.5 billion. after reinstating share repurchases in the second quarter, we accelerated the pace of share buyback in the second half of the year in response to market conditions. Turning to our 2021 outlook, our current guidance reflects our latest assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our guidance includes new items that were unknown at the time of our third quarter call, including the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late December and the corresponding one year increase in Medicare physician payment rates and other COVID-related impacts on our Medicare business. In addition, the significant decline in non-COVID utilization in our Medicare business during the fourth quarter, we'll have an impact on our rich revenue by more than we had anticipated. all in, these items resulted in a net negative headwind of $0.50 to $0.70 per share, relative to the outlook we shared on our third quarter call. like 2020, 2021 presents its own set of the new challenges that we believe to be transient. our core business and underlying fundamentals remain strong, absent those new and unique circumstances. We remain confident that our long-term earnings growth target of 12% to 15% is both credible and sustainable. Turning to our 2021 guidance metrics. Total medical membership is expected to reach 44.4 million members at the midpoint, which reflects growth across our key business segments. In the commercial business, we project our risk-based enrollment in the year between 4.5 million to 4.6 million members. In our fee-based business during the year between 25.5 million and 25.7 million members. in our Medicaid business, we expect to end the year with approximately 10 million to 10.2 million lives, reflecting organic growth in our existing markets and the expectation that the re-verification process that remain on hold through the end of the year. In addition, our guidance also includes growth for North Carolina, which is expected to go wide later this year. In Medicare Advantage, we're projecting double-digit growth at the midpoint as we expect continued measured growth over the balance of 2021. Medicare supplement is expected to end the year between 950,000 and one million members, and our FEP business is expected to be flat to slightly down at 1.6 million members. with IngenioRx, now firmly embedded in our baseline, we expect 2021 operating revenue to be approximately $135.1 billion representing growth of 13.5% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 88% plus or minus 50 basis points, an increase of 120 basis points at the midpoint from 2019, which is the most recent year, in which the health insurer fee does not apply. The increase is largely driven by a mix of business, more heavily skewed to Medicaid and Medicare, and the impact of COVID including the recently announced increase in Medicare physician rates. The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 10.8% plus or minus 50 basis points, primarily due to growth and operating revenue. In addition to the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee and the benefit of modernization efforts, including systems consolidation and broader process automation. Looking below the line, we expect investment income to be $940 million, an interest expense of $785 million. The tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 22% with the decrease primarily driven by the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Full-year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $5.7 billion. As a reminder, operating cash flow in 2020 was heavily impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, as well as certain other receipts that were accelerated into 2020. absent the pull-through of those cash receipts, our 2021 operating cash flow will be roughly 1.1 times to 1.2 times net income. our long-term capital deployment targets are unchanged as we progress down this path of becoming the most innovative, valuable and inclusive partner in the healthcare ecosystem with the continued focus of delivering sustainable long-term shareholder returns. in terms of capital deployment, I am pleased to announce that we are increasing our quarterly dividend by nearly 19% to $1.13 per share, bringing our dividend yield to roughly 1.4% and continuing our trend of annual dividend increases. We expect full-year share repurchase of at least $1.6 billion in our weighted average share count in the year in the range of 246 million to 248 million shares outstanding. As Gail mentioned, this past year presented its own unique set of challenges. And while much has changed, it is clear that we are still in the depths of a global pandemic. We remain committed to our mission of improving the lives and communities, which we serve, and we will continue to do our part in 2021 to meet the needs of our associates, members, customers, and healthcare providers as we persevere through this pandemic together. operator, we will now open it up for questions. Yes. Thank you, justin and good morning. I appreciate the question and the opportunity to clarify the $0.50 to $0.70 change in our expectations. as you mentioned, with the appropriations bill and the extension of the federal health emergency, we now have a disconnect between some of the costs and the embellishments. We completely agree with their approach to the Medicare at 3.75% fee schedule rate increases as well as a sequestration. The Medicare rate increased for 12 months. The sequestration is only for three months is an offset, but there's a third component as well. And that's a 20% bump in the inpatient DRG is going to be extended for the full year, as well as part of the federal health emergency. So, when we take the three of those combined that actually accounts for about two thirds of the $0.50 to $0.70 differential that you're asking about. the other one third really relates to the fact that the non-COVID utilization in the fourth quarter was lower than we had anticipated. And with the non-COVID utilization being lower than anticipated, we are unable to accurately capture all of the HCC codes to reflect our appropriate risk scores in our Medicare business. And so once you factor that in, that's about the other third. So, you take those out and we'll come down to the $25.10 that you have been modeling to the $24.50 at the midpoint. And then in terms of your question associated with the 2022 jump-off point, while it is premature to give 2022 guidance, it would be believed that many of these issues are transient and we're very comfortable affirming the 12% to 15% long-term sustainable growth rate on a $25.10 starting point. We always have the issue with COVID and rich revenues, and things could linger. And we will clearly be on top of that throughout the year. but as an outset, we're very comfortable with the $25.10 jump-off point. And thank you for the question. Yes. Thank you, Jeff \u2013 A.J., I'm sorry. A great question and as you've indicated, there is a lot of variability and assumptions. the most vulnerable populations, which include Medicare advantage members, et cetera and our expectation is by the end of the first quarter that they will achieve the vaccination level appropriate. We're really looking at having somewhere in the neighborhood of about 60% of Americans vaccinated for the year. Medicare, we would expect to be a bit higher, the commercial population and the Medicaid population. We wouldn't expect the vaccines to be rolled out and complete it until the end of the summer. Maybe, even a little bit longer with the commercial population being close to the average for America for the year and then Medicaid being a little bit less. So, to the extent of the rollout and the efficacy of the vaccine, very clearly, could have an impact on the financial results for the year. As COVID costs go down when we do expect non-COVID utilization to increase. So, it's certainly not a one-for-one, but there's clearly a lot of dynamics associated with that modeling. And if the vaccine is either faster or slower, it'll have an impact in one direction or another. And hopefully, that helps. Yes. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. The amount that we've disclosed in terms of the impact on our guidance, it's really the net amount regardless of the risk methodology; we have with the provider network. So certainly, in the capital [ph] arrangement, there is an impact as I had stated in the A.J's question, we also have the 20% bump in inpatient DRG. It's impacting all this as well, and then the sequestration offset. So, we got to take them all into consideration, look at how they play through the reimbursement methodologies and what we've provided is the net impact of all those. Yes. Thank you, Ralph for that question. and when we look at our MLR guidance, we certainly believe it's appropriate given the uncertainty around the timing and the efficacy of the vaccine rollout and the full-year impact of COVID, as well as those unexpected changes in Medicare physician rates and sequestration, timing mismatch that I talked about earlier, have obviously, all been incorporated in the 88%. But we're only looking at 2019 is the point of comparison since that was the last period that there was not a HIF. It's really; it's a fairly simple roll forward from that perspective. You look at the mix of the business that we have today with far more Medicaid members. We actually have had exceedingly strong growth in our Medicare advantage the last few years, being in the upper teens on a couple of year basis and exceeding the rest of the industry. All of that obviously changes our business mix. And just on a apples-to-apples basis, mix is driving about 60 basis points of the increase in the 2021 MLR versus the 2019 MLR. And then when we look at the impacts of COVID and there's a lot of things that go into COVID, there's certainly the cost of COVID, which is in the billions of dollars. There is non-COVID utilization impacts and in terms of, we believe that non-COVID utilization will be less than what a normal year would be in vacuum. And then of course, we had the pricing actions that we've taken into account for that, as well as our reimbursements from regulatory entities that we believe are appropriate in the COVID environment. When we take the net of all those, the impact of COVID is another 30 basis points to 50 basis points on our MLR for 2021. And there's a multitude of other small items going in both directions that may be comprised of last 10 basis points. but it's really, those two items, with mix in COVID. thank you for the question. Sure. I'll start with your question, George. and then and then turn it over to Gail. in terms of the COVID cost, I think really, probably, your question is what type of COVID costs are included in your guidance. And as I said, there's many factors and variables and so we've spent considerable time analyzing and modeling potential impacts. A few of the peers, A.J. in particular, is asking, what happens with COVID vaccine with a lot of different concerns? Well, I'll tell you of all the modeling assumptions we have, the timing and efficacy of the vaccine is one of the assumptions that has the greatest amount of variability associated with it. But anyway all in, we're estimating that we have about a $600 million COVID headwind inherent in our 2021 guidance. And as I said, COVID costs when we include testing, treatment, vaccine administration, all the other things such as the Medicare fee schedules the sequestration, the various waves, it's several billions of dollars. but offsetting that is non-COVID utilization, less than a normal year, the pricing actions that we've taken in regulatory reimbursement and we've been modeling all that and it's coming out to about $600 million. And you only think about that, think about our $24.50, and then you add $600 million to that, that puts us really at the high end or slightly above the high end of our 12% to 15% growth rate range that we've talked about on a sustainable basis. So again, we do believe that a lot of these issues are transient. and there would probably be some lingering effects in the 2022. We feel very good about the underlying core business fundamentals that we have in the company. So, wit that, I'll turn it over to Gail. Thank you for the question, Gary. and as you can imagine when I discussed earlier, the extensive modern that we've done, there's a lot of different thought processes around that. but conceptually, yes, we do believe that there is pent-up demand in the system, and we do believe that there's a chance as it could be higher acuity associated with when folks get care. And that's probably most pronounced in the Medicare line of business. So really, the question is not if those will happen, because we believe those will happen. The question is to what extent and how significant, and then you also have things like emergency room, Biden and we believe will remain low, and that the way that people access care will continue to change a bit in the future as it had in the past. To the extent that COVID stays high, and then we expect non-COVID utilization, whether it's the normal utilization pent-up demand or anything else to actually be below normal. to the extent that COVID subsides and the vaccine is extremely successful. We do expect that to go off, there's really clearly a natural hedge in there. I have talked in response to other questions about what the net impact is and we really don't want to talk about specifically, how much we have for each of those buckets, because you're so fungible and interchangeable, and they do hedge an offset each other. But yes, the promise of your question, we completely agree with that, we believe is that based on our various modeling sensitivities and understanding of our membership that we believe that the guidance we've provided is very solid and very appropriate and prudent. and that we'll be able to manage through changes in either direction. Thank you for the question. Well, the \u2013 thank you. So, there's clearly a disconnect right now. So, say that sequestration versus the DRG bump in the Medicare rate increase of 3.75%. The issue really, is that what the extension of the federal health emergency, the DRG bump is going to be for the full year. We know that based on the Appropriations Act that the Medicare rate schedule is going to be for the full year and sequestrations only for the first 90 days. And unfortunately, that will require a legislative action in order to extend the sequestrations. So, we have not included an extension of that and our guidance at this point in time. That really helps. thanks for the question, Whit. Thanks, Dave. appreciate the question. And get together, all of which knows a little bit of a frame of reference in terms of when I answer it. In terms of some of the Medicaid call-backs, et cetera, we had experienced about a $100 million in the first six months of the year, had about $300 million worth in the third quarter. And during the third quarter call was asked, what do you think the full year is going to be? And I said, probably, we expected to be a little bit more than a $0.5 billion, meaning that just over a $100 million in fourth quarter. While it turned out that it was more than that in the fourth quarter, there is almost $250 million in the fourth quarter and to make almost $650 million for the year. I think it's very important to note that even with that $650 million call-backs with all the various corridor and collar and other rate protections that existed within that block of business, that Medicaid still into 2020 within target margin ranges. In terms of the impacts for the future, we have about half of our Medicaid States are re-priced on January 1. We are very comfortable with the actuarial credibility of those rates thus far and believe that we will continue to work with our state partners, in terms of the challenges that they're facing, and they're respectful of their budget issues, but the still received rates that are actuary sound and actuary solid for 2021. And then there are rate protections, as I said, between collars, corridors, rebates, whatever you want to call them, they all have the same aspect to try to better align cost and revenue within the same timeframe in same period. So, we're actually very bullish about our ability here in Medicaid. And then in terms of the flu season, yes, they \u201ctypical flu season or influenza season is much less than anticipated.\u201d We've factored that in; I've talked about non-COVID utilization being less than normal in total for the year that is part of the calculus. So, we're actually thrilled with a lot of things that we did even; we took staff to ensure that our members had access to the flu vaccine through our fall through campaign. You may not know this, but Anthem partnered with over a 100 community-based organizations across our markets. And we stood up 500 pop-up and drive to clinics and insurance neighborhoods to promote and support higher immunization rates. And we believe some of our efforts help contribute to the lower than normal flu incidence. And as I said, that's all factored into the non-credit utilization comments that I made earlier. I appreciate the question, Dave. Thank you. Yes, sure. Thank you for the question. Our SG&A levels are decreasing and yes, they're really again, to be more consistent with the plans that we discussed at our Investor Day a couple of years ago. We continue to have systems migration strategies, looking very hard to eliminate non-value added work flows and really, enhancing our digital capabilities. Also, at the end of the third quarter of last year, we had some business optimization charges and you're starting to see some of the benefits of that already come through the P&L. So all in, we feel very good about that. We've clearly seen significant revenue growth as well and our revenue growth is far exceeded our growth in SG&A expenses, which serves to lower the SG&A ratio. So, as you know, we're anticipating a lot of growth in Medicaid. Medicaid carries a lower SG&A ratio than the company does in general, in terms of mix and made an average. So, a lot of moving parts and a lot of factors, but we're very confident with our 10.8% and believe that it's very much delivering on the promises that we laid out a couple of years ago at Investor Day. So, thank you for the question. Yes. Sure, Scott. Thank you for the question. Diversified Business Group is extremely important part of our long-term strategy and our long-term growth aspirations. It is not yet large enough to be considered a separate reporting segment under SEC reporting guidelines. So, there's only so much information there that we can provide on a detailed basis. But now in 2021, we do expect to see some nice growth on a specific, on a percentage basis out of Diversified Business Group. The aim is proactively managing capacity as volume returns and we continue to monitor volumes as utilization demand normalizes. The Beacon has initially experienced a reduction in utilization and then rebounded significant throughout the year. Once Beacon and once the vaccine stabilizes the COVID issue, we expect Beacon to really be a meaningful growth driver in that area here for the future. And our program integrity area is also \u2013 the SIU is also within DBG. And that's been impacted a little bit here in 2020 with the lower claims volume and they expect that to kick back up in 2021. So, there are both opportunities for DBG to further penetrate Anthem membership and do things appropriate to help bend the cost curve within Anthem and then sell that externally. Gail just talked to a minute ago about some of the opportunities that they have in DBG, and penetrating more and more of the Blues. So, we're very bullish about DBG's long-term aspirations and helping drive the overall growth of Anthem for the future."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nChris Rigg: Good morning and welcome to Anthem's third quarter 2020 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division.  During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Today, we will discuss our third quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year against the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We will also provide a preliminary view of the headwinds and tailwinds we project heading into 2021.  This morning, Anthem reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, down 14% over the prior year quarter. Our results in the quarter reflects the impacts of ongoing COVID-19 treatment costs, the continued return of a more traditional utilization environment, as well as our ongoing commitment to address financial imbalances to our customers and members.  Since the onset of the health crisis, I\u2019ve been incredibly proud of the way Anthem has continued to respond as a trusted health partner. Beginning with the earlier days of the crisis, we pivoted quickly and look for opportunities to serve in new ways to address the evolving needs of our customers and members and to make a positive difference in the lives we serve.  Armed with our purpose of improving the health of humanity, Anthem has continued to leverage our insights, innovation and partnership to improve lives and deliver a simpler, more affordable and more effective healthcare experience. The heart of Anthem is our local legacy and longstanding focus on the communities where we live and work.  Today, those communities are struggling with issues around food and security and health disparity, social unrest and economic challenges. Our focus on community health fueled by our $50 million commitment seeks to eliminate health disparities and racial inequity. Our passion for this work is driven by our strong track record of addressing true, whole person care, is a social drivers of health.  Throughout the pandemic, we have been connecting with our high risk members, screening for key health factors around housing, food and transportation, as well as ensuring that they have access to basic necessities such as face masks, hand sanitizers and cleaning supplies.  Food and security is not a new issue in America, but the pandemic has only intensified the problems. We know food and security is directly linked to the whole health of individuals, families, communities and businesses. Together with our partner Feeding America, we are calling on leaders across the country to join together to fight hunger and improve the health of our nation.  Here in Indianapolis, we\u2019ve committed with our partners to provide 10 million meals to local residents in need through mobile food banks and program outreach. Anthem has also partnered with Aunt Bertha, a leading social care network help connect individuals and families for free and reduced cost social services in their communities.  These programs include COVID-19 specific assistance with food, transportation, job training and more in every zip code across the country. Supporting efforts to create a more just society is an ongoing priority at Anthem. In light of the health disparities and racial inequities laid there by the pandemic, our work in this area has only accelerated.  For our associates, we continue to reinforce our strong culture and drive an inclusive environment for everyone. And in the City of Indianapolis, we are lending our voice and commitment, the INDY Racial Equity Pledge. This pledge spotlights our joint commitment with the local business and civic community to take meaningful actions to address the issues of health and racial equity towards the goal of a more just community for everyone.  We were also pleased to recently be named to Forbes Annual List Of The Most Just Companies ranking number one in the healthcare sector the second year in a row.  We know this year\u2019s flu season is going to be particularly challenging for our communities in combination with the rising spread of COVID-19. In response, Anthem has launched our Fall Flu Campaign, partnering with over 100 community-based organizations across our markets to stand up more than 500 pop-up and drive-thru clinics providing free flu shots in underserved neighborhoods.  Anthem is continuing to lead and shape our industry for the digital future and our experiences with COVID-19 have only accelerated our innovative efforts in this space. Our Sydney Health Application has more than 2 million unique downloads is helping ensure our members get the care they need where and when they need it. Sydney is delivering personalized engagement, and real-time access to health information, telehealth services and AI symptom-based triage.  Psych Hub is providing a range of mental health resources designed to help consumers and their families cope with the pandemic-related stress brought on by social isolation, job loss, and other challenges. This resource hub is a collaboration among several national leaders in the mental health community. Telehealth usage has been strong and we see that trend continuing, particularly for behavioral health services.  Since the onset of the health crisis, telehealth now comprises 40% to 50% of all behavioral health services compared to low-single-digit utilization pre-COVID. At Investor Day last year, we shared our vision for modernizing our business by consolidating our systems platforms, automating and reimagining processes and embedding digital and AIs across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience.  The charge this quarter enables us to enhance our speed to market as an enterprise to streamline our operations, accelerate our digital journey and ultimately deliver a better experience for those we serve.  Our experience in the last several months of the pandemic saw the pivot quickly to operate virtually and challenge our ways of working. With the insights from this experience, we are reimagining our workplace to the reduced real estate footprint, more selectable work practices and evolving our offices to serve as collaboration spaces when safely able to do so.  Membership trends in the quarter were strong despite the challenging economic environment. Medical membership totaled 42.6 million members, an increase of 172,000 lives sequentially, driven by continued robust organic growth and market share gains in Medicaid and Medicare. This was partially offset by attrition in our commercial business, as a result of the prevailing economic environment.  The risk of a more significant deterioration in our membership is real. But thus far, our overall membership trends are outperforming internal expectations. Our commercial membership declined 0.9% sequentially, which beat expectations in both our risk and fee-based businesses. New account sales supported by new virtual strategies and tools outpaced lapses for the second consecutive quarter despite the challenging environment.  In the Large Group segment, net new Large Group risk sales have exceeded lapses in the 11 of the last 13 months. Importantly, we remain discipline in our pricing and go to market strategy keeping an eye on long-term customer retention.  While we expect to see some headwinds from in group changes over the next several quarters, our focus on sales effectiveness, affordability, and offering a portfolio of product options to meet customers where they are continues to pay-off.  While the 2021 selling season looks different than most, our results year-to-date increase our confidence through sustained momentum in new sales growth, powered by our focus on whole person health. Our Medicaid membership grew by nearly 390,000 lives in the quarter and is up nearly 18% year-to-date due primarily to the pause on re-verification.  The financial performance of our Medicaid business in the quarter was significantly impacted by retroactive, prior period rate adjustments, that totaled nearly $300 million.  As we previously shared, our second quarter results were impacted by the broad based deferral of normal healthcare utilization, while the experience in the third quarter reflects a considerable increase in COVID-related costs, which we expect persists through the balance of the year more than offsetting the impacts of deferred utilization.  We continue to work with our state partners to achieve reimbursement levels that are actuarially found while earning a reasonable return on capital and margins in the 2% to 4% range.  Turning to the Medicare business, our growth of more than 16% year-to-date is outperforming the market average and we expect another year of mid-double-digit growth in 2021. The recently released star scores for payment year 2022 however are disappointing. Our pharmacy scores remain the single largest driver of our underperformance.  As a reminder, our Medicare Advantage members transitioned to IngenioRx on January 1, 2020, which limited our ability to improve our pharmacy scores in the latest measurement period. We are intensely focused on our star ratings with significant improvement expected over the next year. We are seeing a strong start to the annual enrollment period demonstrating that our multi-channel approach is delivering results.  Digital platforms have long been an area of focus even prior to the pandemic and this year, we expect to gain a significant percentage of our sales through digital channels. The development of our Medicare Care Guide is just one way we are enhancing our members\u2019 onboarding experience with proactive outreach to help them understand their benefits and enhance the onboarding process and overall new member experience.  Our 2021 offering reflects our industry-leading supplemental benefits, which include the popular over-the-counter offering, transportation, dental and vision benefits, as well as benefits to address social drivers of health such as food delivery and service animal care, positioning us for another year of above market growth Medicare Advantage.  Importantly, we expect to see nearly 90% of our members in $0 premium plans for 2021 as we continue to the fourth quarter, our compassionate commitment to making a positive difference for all of our stakeholders will continue.  With that, I will now turn the call over to John for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and our preliminary review of the headwinds and tailwinds we project heading into 2021. John? \nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, a decline of 14% year-over-year. While our GAAP quarterly results included a few significant charges, our adjusted earnings were otherwise relatively consistent with our overall expectations.  Our results reflect the departure from normal seasonality trends due to the continued impact of COVID-19 utilization, as well as the actions we voluntarily took to support our members, customers, communities, and care providers.  We continue to offer expanded benefit policy changes to adjust cost share waivers for COVID-19 treatment has access to 24/7 telehealth at no cost, provided grants and support for our communities to name a few.  Our adjusted third quarter results exclude our expected share of the impending Blue Cross, Blue Shield Litigation settlement, as well as the charges related to the business optimization efforts that Gail referenced earlier.  The impending Blue Cross and Blue Shield litigation settlement removes an uncertain while the business optimization charges are the latest milestone in our journey of delivering on our commitment to achieving an SG&A ratio of 11% to 12% by 2023.  These initiatives are aligned with our enterprise strategy and represent a reallocation of resources in high growth and high impact areas such as AI and digital. After transitioning the majority of our associates to work from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to reassess and further optimize our real estate footprint as we gained a better understanding of our organization\u2019s capacity to work from home.  Anthem\u2019s third quarter operating gain was $201 million, a decline of $1.3 billion from the prior year. Absent the aforementioned major adjustment items, operating gain in the quarter declined 8% or $126 million. Our underlying results reflect elevated COVID-19-related cost across our commercial and government lines of business and retroactive Medicaid rate adjustment, partially offset by deferred healthcare utilization and strong performance in IngenioRx.  Medical membership was 42.6 million members at the end of September, growth of more than 1.6 million lives year-to-date. This growth is further evidence that Anthem has the most balanced and resilient membership mix in the sector. Time and time again, we have shown the ability to grow at stronger comps which was illustrated by industry-leading organic membership growth in 2019, as well as during periods of economic uncertainty, as we have continue to grow membership throughout 2020. Since the end of the first quarter, enrollment in Medicaid has grown by more than double, a decline in our employer group businesses, excluding Blue Card.  As a matter of fact, our Medicaid membership growth is approximately ten times the decline in our commercial risk-based members. And of course, this is going on while we continue to exhibit double-digit growth year-over-year in our Medicare Advantage.  Operating revenue in the third quarter of 2020 was $30.6 billion, an increase of approximately 16% versus the prior year quarter, and nearly 15% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher premium revenue from solid growth in our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Pharmacy revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx and the return of the health insurer fee. The increase was partially offset by risk-based enrollment declines in our commercial and specialty business driven by higher unemployment rates. The medical loss ratio in the third quarter was 86.8%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year.  On a HIF-adjusted basis, MOR in the quarter increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by increased cost related to COVID-19 including actions to support our members, customers and providers in addition to the retroactive Medicaid rate adjustments.  Non-COVID utilization in the third quarter largely returned to normal levels or roughly 95% of historical baseline. And when coupled with the cost of COVID-19 care, overall utilization was above baseline. As discussed on our second quarter call, we continue to expect the second half mix adjusted MOR to come in a couple hundred basis points higher than normal seasonality trends would suggest, driven by COVID-19 cost and the continued recovery in non-COVID utilization throughout the remainder of the year.  Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 17.3%, an increase of 440 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. However, excluding major adjustment items, SG&A in the quarter was 13.4%, reflecting an increase of 50 basis points. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with return of the health insurer fee, and increased spend to support growth, partially offset by growth of operating companies.  We experienced an operating cash outflow of $1.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by the payment of the health insurers fee for the full year, as well as the timing of two additional federal tax payments that were previously deferred as permitted by the IRS.  For the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow was $6.9 billion, or 1.7 times to net income. Excluding the impacts, net income from the major adjustment items in the quarter are multiple of cash flow to net income year-to-date would have been 1.4 times.  Turning to the balance sheet, our debt-to-cap ratio was 39.2% at the end of the third quarter, which is consistent with our target range. Days and claims payable was 41.1 days, down from 46 days at the end of the second quarter, but up 1.3 days year-over-year with the medical claims liability increasing 14% versus growth in premium revenue of 11% over the same period, evidence of our solid reserve.  In the quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $265.73 for a total cost of $759 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased 5 million shares at an average price of $269.15 or $1.3 billion in total cost. 2020 has been unprecedented in many ways with much still unclear on the future course of the pandemic and the macro economy.  However, we are proud of our organization\u2019s ability to adapt, providing care for those we serve and delivering relief and support to our stakeholders. At this time, we remain committed to our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of greater than $22.30. As you have heard this morning, we have consistently demonstrated strong performance despite operating in an environment characterized by uncertainty.  While COVID-19 is certainly introduced many challenges, our long-term growth plan remains firmly intact as we seek to gain share in the Medicare Advantage market, leveraging growth at diversified business groups, increased the profitability of our fee-based business and modestly grow share in the commercial risk-based business.  Importantly, we invite you to attend our Virtual 2021 Investor Day Meeting on March 3rd, where we will discuss our long-term strategy in greater detail. As it relates to 2021 guidance, we will provide a more detailed outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.  Further, as you contemplate the headwinds and tailwinds, we see for next year, please keep in mind there is much more uncertainty than the normal given the unknowns related to COVID such as the timing, and efficacy of a vaccine, or if we could see another round of deferred utilization.  With that as background, our initial view of 2021 contemplates the following tale; the permanent repeat of the health insurer fees, which we use to partially offset investment in our Medicare business to improve our star scores, accretion from the 2020 M&A activity and share repurchases, IngenioRx growth and the continued progress on our commercial 5 to 1, to 3 to 1 strategy and Medicare Advantage membership growth. These will be partially offset by Medicaid reverifications and raid actions in the context of return to a normal operating environment. Commercial enrollment pressure, primarily in-group change as a result of broader economic challenges and higher investment spending to support long-term growth.  At this early stage, our view of 2021 would affirm our long-term EPS growth rate of 12% to 15% albeit skewed to the lower half given the unusual risk and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic.  And with that, operator we will now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Stephen Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open. \nStephen Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, just on those comments on the tailwinds and headwinds, that was certainly helpful. The one I was curious to hear more about was the higher investment spending. Can you give us give a little more color maybe on that piece, in particular as you are thinking about trends for that for next year versus what you are spending voluntarily this year? Thanks. \nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, Steve. Appreciate the question. And, the higher investment spending really is, putting more and more money into our AI and digital capabilities, investing more in stars in order to ensure that we improve our number of members covered by four star plan in the next rating period and beyond.  And, really the way that that care is going to be accessed here in the future is slightly different than how it\u2019s been accessed in the past from really investing in the various networks and capabilities to meet the customers where they need to be met. So, we\u2019ll provide a lot more specificity on that at Investor Day in terms of automating and reimagining processes and embedding digital and AI across the enterprise.  It\u2019s all about simplifying and improving the customer experience. So, hopefully that can provide you a little bit of context here in the mean time. \nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll just also reiterate what John just said, which is, we have been investing what we found is that there is an opportunity to accelerate those investments as a result of the increased adaption that we\u2019ve seen over the course of the pandemic, particularly in our digital assets, where we made significant commitments around our Sydney and our Psych Hub and other things where we are seeing our consumers more actively engage with those assets.  And then, stars is obviously a key priority for us and we continue to build a team there as well as invest in ensuring that we can pull through what we are doing in our pharmacy now that we have an under IngenioRx.  Thank you very much. Next question please. \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice : Thanks. Hi everybody. Just one point of clarification and then a question. The 2021 outlook growth rate, is that using 2020 to 2030 jumping off point as the base? Or is there any adjustments we should make in thinking about what the base is for this year?  And then, my broader question is, you mentioned the puts and takes you have to deal with in thinking about the outlook for next year in developing medical cost trends, can you just maybe flush out a little bit more what are you thinking next year for medical cost trend and what are some of the major unknown variables or variables you have in the reservoir as you think about that cost trend expectation for next year, particularly like in the commercial risk business? \nGail Boudreaux: Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, AJ. Let me start now, have John provide a little bit more color. As you said, at this early stage, our view of 2021 would affirm our long-term EPS growth rate of 12% to 15% off the guidance of 2020 to 2030 as you mentioned.  Although as John commented in his prepared remarks it\u2019s skewed towards a little over a half of the range, just given the unusual risk and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic. So with that, let me have John give you a little bit more color on some of the other specifics that you asked in your question. John? \nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, Gail. And, good morning, AJ. Our 2021 trend expectations and really I think you maybe pointing to commercial pricing actions are very important, obviously many variables they have considered as part of our trend and our pricing assumptions. And I\u2019ll just be clear for everyone on the call here for competitive reasons, we are not going to provide a specific point estimate of where we see trend coming or what our pricing assumptions are at this point in time.  But I do think it would be instructive to highlight some of the things are considered. First of all, there is a permanent repeal the health insurer fee and that repeal actually is going to save Anthem customers or actually $2 billion in 2021 and certainly we removing its burden helps mitigate the impact of cost. And also, really looking closely at how will care be accessed in 2021.  For instance, telehealth, ER visits, standalone surgery centers, other site of service changes, how are they going to evolve before and after a vaccine is available, And overall utilization be impacted or just it\u2019s the way that CARES Act. Certainly, we are trying to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 testing and treatment, assessing how much pent-up demand still exists versus the permanent cancellation of procedures. And then how is deferred utilization impacted underlying acuity.  And like, the list goes up, those are all just variables that are incremental and on top of the normal variables that exists each and every year when we assess trends. So, the one thing I\u2019ll say with all of that though, is that we are being very disciplined in our approach and we are being very disciplined in our pricing.  Our pricing covers forward trend. We have committed that. We were priced to cover forward trend and we\u2019ll continue to do so. So we\u2019ll provide more insights into this in early 2021 questions on our fourth quarter call next January. And of course, as I stated on March 3rd during our Virtual Investor Day provide a lot more insights.  But these are many of the variables that we are really working our way through right now as we finalize our 2020 year.  Thank you, AJ \nGail Boudreaux: Thanks very much. Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. One quick numbers question that I wanted to ask about Medicaid. So, on numbers, can you share with us the next if tailwinds, John, that you talked about that you are thinking about for 2021. I know you said that was offset by some reimbursement in stars. Want to get that net number from you.  And then, can you talk to your views on Medicaid rate actions for 2021 being as given. I remember you expect it to end this year at 3% margins in Medicaid. Can you talk about that within the expectation for next year in terms of \u2013 do you expect to be at that 3% target for 2021? Or do you saw moderation in your \u2013 in services resumes within that 2021 guidance? Thanks. \nJohn Gallina: Hey, Justin, I apologize. Can you repeat the first half of your two-part question? I am not sure I understood everything you said. \nJustin Lake: Sure. Just first look at the net if tailwind for 2021? \nJohn Gallina: Oh the net if tailwind, okay.\nJustin Lake: Medicaid margins for next year. Thanks. \nJohn Gallina: Yes. The HIF, as I said, that was part of the overall headwinds and tailwinds that we had and in response to AJ\u2019s question, we\u2019ve certainly tried to factor everything into our headwinds and tailwinds as part of reaffirming our long-term growth rate and really don\u2019t want to get into cherry picking certain items as to why something as part of a starting point and my something else is not right. On HIF and of itself, we are looking at $0.60 to $0.80 of a tailwind in 2021 associated with the permanent repeal of that law.  Related to \u2013 as we said, part of it\u2019s going to be is to help fund some of the investments in Medicare to improve star ratings and other things. So, there is certainly a lot of fungibility associated with any number of headwinds or tailwinds, but $0.60 to $0.80, I think is the dollarized impact of the question.  Related to the 2021 and the Medicaid rate environment, obviously we are working very closely with the states to ensure that we get actuarially appropriate rates working through whether it be the collars of the corridors and how those things are impacting the methodology, I think we\u2019ll advice very wide open in terms of that. And as I said, conversations with our state partners regarding the need to have sound rates as we quickly return to a normal operating environment.  So, our expectation is, is that, we\u2019ll be able to achieve a appropriate return on capital and operate well within the target margin range in Medicaid in 2021 and are actually focused on being relatively close to the midpoint of that range. \nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nRicky Goldwasser : Yes. Hi. Good morning. My question is on the utilization trends that you are seeing, also you stated we are returning back to normal. So maybe you can give a little bit more color about the difference between the different books? And what type of procedures you are seeing coming back?  And especially as we think about this is looking ahead to 2021, John, you talked about the difference in the titles procedures is coming back. So if you think about ER visits if you are seeing less utilization there, does this mean that if that\u2019s likely to expect that these types of utilization will be back in 2021 and how is that shaping your thoughts to next year?\nJohn Gallina: Sure. Thank you, Ricky for that question. And maybe I\u2019ll provide some context that might answer questions that are in the queue as well in terms of your question. So, if you look at the underlying claims that we are seeing, as I stated in my prepared comments that, they are, excluding COVID would be below baseline levels.  But then, when you add COVID cost back in, we are exiting the third quarter at greater than baseline. So, we started the third quarter with a combination of both underlying procedures and COVID cost being below baseline and we ended the quarter with the combination to being above baseline. We fully expect that the fourth quarter would be above baseline for the entire quarter given the recent surge in COVID, as well as all the other trends that we are seeing.  Associated with where we are seeing some of the rebound, outpatient surgery has recovered the fast as pre-COVID and it\u2019s actually even trending above baseline in some instances. Some of the more costly procedures such as joint replacement surgeries have come back faster.  And a lot of that was anticipated and the actions we took to intentionally redirect care to the outpatient setting to ensure continuity of care are coming through. And to that end, we are focused on ensuring our members are getting the care they need in a timely manner, whether it be through telehealth or by redirecting certain procedures to outpatient setting.  The ER utilization is still below baseline at this point in time and we expect that to continue for a while as well. So, we are clearly taking all these things to consideration as we look at 2021 trends and as I stated for competitive reasons, we are not committing to a point estimate at this \u2013 on this call. But there is a natural system capacity constraint that will cause some utilization to carry into 2021 and we are certainly factoring that work off. Thank you for the question, Ricky. \nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Stephen Tanal from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. \nStephen Tanal : Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. And just on also Medicaid, maybe two-part question on this. So, Medicaid enrollment, obviously been really strong, it looks like pre-determination will be suspended at least through year end based on the last 8-K just \u2013 primarily health emergency. So, wondering if you guys had to do on enrollment in peak and then sort of related, small follow-up.  So, I believe that pretty decent outlook to the margin, but I guess, we are pointing on the rate path and other corridor and collar type actions you guys are taking, can you give us a sense for what that all in how to enrollment will take in 2020. I think that it was almost $300 million a quarter and how do you think 2021 looks versus 2020? And that would be helpful. \nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Thanks for the question. I am going to ask Felicia Norwood to address some of your specific questions about reverification and timing of rates. But in terms of your very specific question about the all-in, what we expect that to be, as I said in my prepared remarks, $300 million was what we had in the quarter and we are expecting, obviously given where utilization goes and things that could move a little bit around $500 million would be that number. But with that, let me ask Felicia speak to the other questions you had. Felicia? \nFelicia Norwood : Yes. Good morning, Stephen and thanks for the question. As you mentioned, Medicaid growth had certainly been accelerated during this period, we\u2019re up 4.8% quarter-over-quarter and almost $389,000 over second quarter. And at this point, I don\u2019t know if we would back to the \u2013 just say when that peak is going to happen.  When you take a look at where we are today, states have spend at their reverification at least through the end of the public health emergency. That public health emergency right now will go through January 21st of next year. But in addition to the public health emergency, states are also receiving enhanced FMAP. So we would expect that states will continue to suspend reverification through the period of enhanced FMAP.  So that could be certainly through the end of January of next year as we head into February. We\u2019ve been in constant conversations with our state partners with respect to continuity of care for our members, particularly during this time of a pandemic. And continuity of care is very important. So we work with our state partners trying to make sure that we are working closely around aborting any type of clip event.  So I am not sure at this point, when things are going to peak certainly as long as this has a continuation of the public health emergency and the enhanced FMAP that states are currently receiving. Thank you. \nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. \nRalph Giacobbe : Thanks. Good morning. Just want to first just clarify quickly, on the Medicaid side, I think you mentioned target margins to get this 3% by 2021. I was hoping if you could give us a sense of where you think it will shake out for 2020?  And then, just wanted to ask about, membership was obviously holding better than our expectations and it sounds like your expectations as well. But the overall performance seems generally in line and guidance maintained. So, if you could help on what that delta is? Is it just cost coming back fast certainly you thought? Is it higher COVID or something else? Thanks. \nJohn Gallina: Yes. Ralph, thank you for the questions. In terms of target margins associated with Medicaid, we have \u2013 as you know, we have well over a half of our states are January 1 renewals and we are working very closely with them on rate actions. And that the trend information that\u2019s utilized for January 1 renewals is typically the two prior years.  So, 2018 and 2019 are the \u2013 really the actuarially sound rate information we have associated with that. So, we feel very good about how those conversations are going and where those rates are coming out. In terms of 2020, it\u2019s an interesting dynamic with all the deferred utilizations, the increase in COVID costs, some of the call backs of premiums, all in, we are \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve had a $22.30 EPS guidance that we reaffirmed.  The overall margins within Medicaid are coming out within the target margin range, but there is a lot of variables and lot of hard work to get there. But clearly, we are trending in the right direction during this period of uncertainty. Associated with the membership, as you know, we feel very good about our membership.  We think we have the most resilient membership mix in the business. We grow in periods of strong economic times. We grow in periods of economic uncertainty. And we made a cognizant decision here in 2020 that, we would help address the imbalances and inequities in the system created by the pandemic. So, as our membership continues to get stronger and stronger, we are helping give it back to maintain our guidance.  And then, lastly, in terms of the fourth quarter, we do expect the fourth quarter to have an elevated medical loss ratio and that\u2019s because the underlying cost of services, plus the pent-up demand that is partially coming through, plus the COVID cost that we are covering on top of all of that, we expect to be above baseline. And so, we are usually looking at a 300 to 350 basis point MOR in the fourth quarter higher than what normal seasonality would suggest. But thank you for those questions. \nGail Boudreaux: Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Sara James from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nSara James : Thank you. Can you speak to what is in federal versus the individual state control of when redeterminations for Medicaid turns back on. I am wondering if we could end up with different states turning on at different times and then when it does turn on, how long does it take to the states to catch up on evaluations and fully base out the benefit? Thanks. \nGail Boudreaux: Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood : Good morning, Sara and thanks for the question. As I said, I would expect that states would suspend reverifications at least through the public health emergency and the enhanced FMAP. Once that happens, states have the ability to control when they return to reverifications with respect to membership. What the Federal government requires is that, Medicaid members to have their eligibility redetermined at least what, every twelve months.  States can decide whether or not they want to then execute upon that beginning in the next quarter or thereafter, but you generally get through your entire Medicaid book of business over a twelve month period. So, as we take a look at our portfolio, which as you know is 23 states, all of those states will make determinations around when they commit reverifications at varying different intervals.  We are working very closely with our state partners and they\u2019ve been very collaborative with us around helping us to educate members around the reverification process and what\u2019s necessary, once that reverification process commences. But the return to reverification, the timing, the cadence around when that happens with respect to membership is certainly left with the state partners in terms of when that happens. \nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Felicia. Next question please? \nOperator: Next question we\u2019ll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Wondering, I guess, just quantify the 2022 impact of the settlement on the Blue Cross Blue Shield. Just wanted to see this obviously other aspects to that settlement beyond the financial payment.  I was wondering if you could provide some color on if that settlement in any way would impact your view on 12% to 15% long-term growth, and/or change the way everything as you get to that 12% to 15% growth number? \nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Kevin. In terms of the settlement that we announced today in the financials, we will be including in our 10-Q a much more fulsome discussion. So, just to give you a perspective of that, which will be filed this morning. BCBSA and the Blue plans have approved the settlement agreement and relief to the subscriber settlement as part of the case.  If approved, which the court still has to review it requires us to make the monetary settlement which we took our portion of its part of the third quarter charge. But also, there are a couple of non-monetary terms. One, eliminating the national best efforts rule in our license agreement.  And the second is allowing for some larger national employers with self-funded benefits to be able to request to bid for insurance coverage from a second Blue plan in addition to the local Blue plan.  As you know, we fully accrued our estimated liability in the third quarter of 2020. In terms of the impact of that, we view our strategy has been very consistent and don\u2019t really see any changes in our overall strategy. Thanks for the question. Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. \nJoshua Raskin : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, just back on the commercial memberships holding up a little bit better, I am curious if you are seeing any recent signs of furloughs becoming more permanent.  If you guys have a better view on sort of what percentage your membership is currently in furlough, meaning not getting salary, but still getting their benefits? And then, maybe any geographic areas or segments that are seeing different trends from the overall book. \nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question. Josh. I am going to have Pete Haytaian response to that on the commercial business. \nPete Haytaian: Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. And yes, definitely commercial membership and enrollment activity continue to perform better than we expected. You noted furloughs. We don\u2019t have specific information on the volume of furloughs. We are obviously paying close contact with our employer and broker partners regarding this and we\u2019ve done a lot to make sure that we protect the membership and provide them with a lot of options in that regard.  I\u2019d say, that furloughs, as well as the fact that we have a disproportionate share of our membership in less risky segments which has certainly helped us and then as I think you alluded to the unemployment rate, it\u2019s certainly lower than we had originally expected. I\u2019d say, but most importantly, from an execution perspective, in terms of what we can control, I am really pleased with the teams\u2019 performance.  Our sales exceeded our last as again as we have for the last several quarters. One important point then to note, our fully insured membership in commercial actually only declined 27,000 members in the quarter. So, the overall net negativity that you are seeing in our membership is really caused by in-group change. And then as we look forward, your point about the future, we are modeling continued declines in the commercial market.  We aren\u2019t necessarily seeing great variation by market. It\u2019s really hard to predict that with precision. But we are expecting continued declines. I would say that our early read, October is a continuation of what we saw in Q3. So, nothing that\u2019s fundamentally changes that.  And then finally, I\u2019d just say, I think we are really well positioned. I am very pleased with the teams. The last couple of years we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on investing in a product portfolio and having product options to meet customers where they are and as the economy improves, I am confident that we\u2019ll have a solution for them. \nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open. \nLance Wilkes : Yes. Wanted to ask a little further on 2021 with respect to the employer business, and in particular interested in your outlook for, kind of wins, losses, so not the in-group aspect of it. And then, cross-sales and Ingenio penetration, how is that looking as you are kind of getting through the selling season here?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll have Pete add additional more color. But I as I shared in our opening remarks, we feel really good about our ability to increase our sales relative to our lapses.  And so, while this has been a very unusual year, we are still seeing particularly in the mid and lower \u2013 our small group business we are seeing really strong results because of our sales effectiveness. But I\u2019ll have Pete give you a bit more, because I think the work that his team has done over the last two years is really showing results this year. \nPete Haytaian: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Lance. In the areas that we\u2019ve closed out selling \u2013 so for example, balancing group retiree we are very pleased, as Gail said with our execution and how we\u2019ve done. The activity in 2020 for 2021, at least in national for example in group retiree was \u2013 that was actives. As you would expect, some of the larger jumbo accounts, they did defer and you would expect that in light of what\u2019s going on, associated with the COVID.  But as Gail said, down market, smaller accounts, we are seeing a lot of really good activity. Our value proposition is really resonating in the marketplace. Our focus on advocacy with solutions like Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Sydney technology, our consumer engagement platform, innovative programs like Total Health, Total You, et cetera are really playing well in the market.  We launched, as you probably have heard, high performing networks with our Blue Assisted plans across the country covering 55 MSAs. All these things are playing into our growth into 2021 and we feel good about that. Obviously, in-group change and the economy remains a big variable as it relates to the ultimate impacts.  As it relates to the second part of your question, Ingenio and upselling, our approach 5 to 1, to 3 to 1, as it relates to what we can control, I feel really good about our progress and future prospects getting to the 301. Prior to COVID, this year, we were solidly on track to get to quarter one. COVID definitely did set us back a little bit, as you\u2019d expect.  But even with COVID, we are seeing really good activity across all the component parts that generate growth in our strategy 5 to 1 to 3 to 1. Our penetration rates and upselling rates around specialty products continues to improve. Obviously with affordability being a big focal point us selling the total value proposition across medical specialty and pharmacy, really seems to be playing well.  Our Anthem Whole Health Connections is really resonating similarly with all our clinical programs. We\u2019ve actually pushed really good programs like Total Health, Total You down into the local markets. And then as it relates to IngenioRx, we do feel really good about the future opportunities. Again, very similar, as it relates to big jumbo opportunities, there was a little slowing in that regard and people potentially deferring into the future.  But as we head into 2021, we have some sales ready. We feel really good about the upsell opportunity, pharmacy into our medical and selling that total value proposition. I look forward to working with my new colleague Jeff Walter and the Ingenio team on that. \nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Frank Morgan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nFrank Morgan : Good morning. Appreciate your updated color around the mid-double-digit growth in the MA side of the business and I think in the past, you talked about the growth in telephonic sales. But I think did I say, expectations around our growth into digital channel. So, just any incremental color around that versus the telephonic channel and given COVID, do you have any thoughts or expectations around the level of planned switching with any of the plans as AEP? Thank you. \nGail Boudreaux: Well, thank you very much for the question. Just real quickly, when we start with the planned switching, we do expect less switching this year as people are shopping less. We\u2019ve had a strong and growing amount of sales from our digital channels and we do think that that is going to be particularly strong.  Early returns are showing that already. Obviously, face-to-face during a time of COVID is a little more difficult. So, again, we are expecting a very strong \u2013 strong results as I shared in our opening comments around Medicare Advantage and digital will be a very big part of that. Thank you next question. \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nRobert Jones : Great. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to the investment comments and just get a better sense about the investments not only for this year, but you highlighted a headwind from investments next year. So, I guess, maybe this year, just a $600 million in the business optimization charges that you had in the quarter. I know you cited areas like speed to market, streamlining operations, and then some of the digital initiatives it sounded like.  So, maybe just a little bit more on those investments? And then in 2021, how, I guess, are those investments potentially different? What areas would they be focused in and anything around the size of those investments as you sit here today and think about next year would be really helpful. Thanks. \nGail Boudreaux: Yes. So I think there is two areas of the charge that I just want to make sure. One is around the reduction in the footprint, because we are reimagining our office space. And again, we are going to still be an office-based company and we will still have a presence in all of the states where we do business. But what we\u2019ve learned as part of the pandemic is that, we are really going to change the nature of those bases and consolidate the number of them we have in each of it, places that we work.  In terms of the investments we made, those are all very consistent with what we discussed back in Investor Day last year. And again, what we\u2019ve learned as part of the pandemic is an acceleration of both our ability to implement. So acceleration of digital that we\u2019ve been building, that needs a great examples, Psych Hubs and other ones, telehealth.  All of those things we\u2019ve seen consumers much more readily adapt and use than we had even predicted and so part of that is accelerating that and how our workflows and business processes as part of what we\u2019ve been doing, we embarked on an initiative to really simplify our operating environment to improve experiences for consumers to take out redundant steps, improve how we reach out to consumers, use AI-enabled claim adjudication.  So, things along that nature. Very consistent, but it\u2019s \u2013 again an acceleration that we see in usage pick up dramatically. So we\u2019ve been able to accelerate the work that we are doing. Thanks for the question and next question please. \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nGeorge Hill : Hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. I guess, John, not a numbers question, but just interested in how you guys think about how if utilization mix continues to change, I guess, can you talk about how you guys think that reflects in pricing for 2021? And have you guys looked at current utilization kind of modeled that into the pricing for 2021?  And then, just kind of a nitpicking question, when you talked about the lower end of the range for 2021, was it your intention to basically tighten the range that\u2019s off the 13% growth. So we\u2019ll see a tighter EPS guidance range for next year as opposed to a wider range which could be 12% to 15%? \nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the questions, George. I\u2019ll start with your last question first. Our long-term stated growth rate is still 12% to 15%. There is no intention of tightening that and we do believe that the 12% to 15% range is a sustainable range that we can deliver on for quite some time. The comment about being too lower end was just really due to an overabundance of caution, given the uncertainties related to the entire pandemic and COVID situation.  Related to the utilization question at the beginning, we have done really a lot of sophisticated modeling. Our various scenarios that we modeled since the beginning of the crisis have been going on and we constantly updated and incorporate new learnings in the model as the pandemic is involved. The recovery in utilization maybe lumpy.  We do believe our assumptions are very sound. As I stated I think in an answer to an earlier question, there will be some natural system capacity constraint that we do believe will cause some utilization to naturally carryover into 2021. And just to be clear, yes, we have tried to think through all of those and incorporate all of those variables into our 2021 thought process.  And then, as I stated before, we are pricing the cover forward trend. And so, our expectation is, is that, that we will cover forward trends in terms of our pricing and our revenue associated with price differences. Thank you. \nGail Boudreaux: Next question please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Whit Mayo with UBS. Please go ahead. \nWhit Mayo : Thanks. Good morning. What are you guys thinking about or sharing some [Indiscernible] at levels across all your lines of business this year. So, maybe instead of asking suspenders, what are the signposts that you are looking towards perhaps shift that policy? \nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Whit. You know, as we think about policies, obviously, in our government business, that continues to be and I think part of the guideposts really are about and where we are in the pandemic and access to care. Right now, we are seeing offices open and we are seeing individuals to have access to care clearly as long as there is a serious issue on COVID and the pandemic.  And we are seeing rise in cases. It\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate. There is a lot of uncertainties right now and a lot of questions. Timing into vaccine, expanded testing which we continue to model pent-up demand and we are seeing as we mentioned that going above the baseline. So we are seeing people access care, which is important.  And remember, our goal is also, we are reaching out to make sure that people have the right access to care particularly those we know who have multiple kind of conditions across our book of business. So, in terms of that, we continue to model it. We continue to look at it and our goal is to ensure that we have appropriate access to care.  And that is, we are learning a lot more about each of the events that are happening with COVID. Thanks for the question and next one please? \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nDave Styblo: Hi there. Thanks for the question. So, a quick clarification. John, when you talked about the MOR being 300 to 350 days at this point, above normal is sort of a fourth quarter of 18 a reasonable pocket to think about as a point of clarification. And then, second \u2013 the other question really is on Medicare Advantage.  You guys are talking about double-digit growth again more strong momentum. I guess, in past years, just the geographic expansion of your footprint has certainly helped that, as we look at the MA landscape file this period, it looks like you are only expanding by 1% or 2% of the senior population. So, I am just wondering what gives you confidence that you can sustain that momentum in terms of taking share from peers? \nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Dave. I\u2019ll answer the first half of the question associated with the MOR. Yes, the fourth quarter of 2018, of course doesn\u2019t need to be mix adjusted a bit for the fact that our membership mix has changed. But the fourth quarter of 2018 is as good of a starting point as any from a comparative basis to look at that 300, 350 basis point increase that I referenced. \nGail Boudreaux: In terms of the second question, why do we feel confident about our growth projections? There are few things. One, I shared in my opening comments, which is really very strong product offering. We expect 90 plus percent of our members to be in or have access to zero premium plans. Our supplemental benefits continue to be some of the strongest offerings in this space.  And then third, we believe that there is still significant opportunity in our states to expand. I mean, right now, we don\u2019t have number one market share in many of those states and there is growth. We do have number one market share in the commercial space and our Blue brand is incredibly strong in those states. And then states where we are selling outside our Blue brand, we also are seeing some really nice momentum.  We have partnerships and joint ventures with our Blue rather. And so, again, we are seeing a lot of momentum. Our brand resonates well. Our digital channels are also resonating very well in terms of the sales to marketplace. So, overall, while we don\u2019t have a significant \u2013 we have some expansion.  We expect to gain market share in our states and we do think that our 85 new counties that we\u2019ve entered will also help us. But again, we feel our offerings are very strong and are resonating quite well. Thank you. Next question please. \nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. \nSteve Willoughby : Hi. Good morning. Just a quick question. I was wondering how you guys are thinking about cost of vaccines and therapies for COVID in 2021 in terms of essentially who is going to be paying for them and how much?\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question. I think, while you are focused on vaccines, no one really has the ultimate answer at this stage, where we are watching the situation very closely and learning about the potential. We\u2019ve modeled a lot of scenarios into our pricing. There is a number of variables, obviously around vaccines including when they\u2019ll be available from as early as January, or is it summer of 2021.  Clearly, dosing requirements, vaccination rates, storage, transportation, whole lot of things. I mean, that obviously goes to say that there is a ton of variables. But remember, vaccines are only one cost of COVID in total. We are looking at the total cost of COVID and I wouldn\u2019t look at this into cancellation. Our goal obviously is to advocate to protect our highest risk members first.  So, again that gets to the timing. But we also understand that CMS is going to be providing guidance at some point and we\u2019ll obviously look to follow their lead accordingly. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. I apologize. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nGary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. A two-part question. Given the business optimization benefits are fairly material number, would you anticipate also excluding those from adjusted earnings guidance in 2021? The second part of the question, just wondering we looked the last four years share repurchases around between about $1.7 billion and $2 billion annualized \u2013 on an annualized basis. Would it be in that range again this year? Anything extraordinary contemplated there for either 4Q or 2021 in that 2021 outlook? Thanks. \nJohn Gallina: Yes. Hey. Good morning, Gary. And thank you for the questions. Yes, first of all in the business optimization, we did certainly exclude the charge here in the third quarter. And the benefits associated with that will certainly come through over a period of years and become part of our runrate cost savings associated with the administrative structure of this company.  And again, as we had talked about, we have got our plan to get to a 11% to 12% SG&A ratio by 2023 that we have referenced at our Investor Day and this is certainly one step to get there. The other part of the question or the answer I would say is that, we\u2019ve also talked about incrementally investing really putting more money into the digital and AI, putting more money into the stars type of investments and we are obviously not going to exclude any of those cost from our numbers.  So, 2021, we think should be fairly clean from that perspective that we\u2019ll have some savings and we\u2019ll have some reinvestment opportunities to really help position the company much, much better for the future. \nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And I just like to reiterate too, it\u2019s a one-time charge. So just so we are clear about that. \nJohn Gallina: Yes. This year, yes, thank you. And then, on the share repurchase, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately $1.3 billion through the end of September. We have a increased share repurchase pace a bit here in the third quarter, especially when our stock price was really down, we thought far greater than what it could or should have been based on a PE multiple perspective.  We are obviously going to be opportunistic and watchful of market conditions. Our stated goal is to reinvest about 50% of our free cash flow into either M&A or back into the business, 30% in the share buyback and 20% in the dividends. As I\u2019ve stated, I do believe that those buckets are going to be appropriate over a five year period of time.  They will never be exactly correct in any one quarter. And probably not even exactly correct in any one full year. But I would expect that we would continue our share buyback here in the fourth quarter and maybe end the year little bit higher than what we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years, just given the weakness in the stock price that we saw.  And then head into 2021 from there. But at the end of the day, we need to be opportunistic with our capital and ensure that it\u2019s being allocated appropriately. Thank you, Gary. \nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, John. I think we have time for one last question. \nOperator: And our final question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel : Okay. Thanks. Thanks for sending me in here under the wire. A question, I just wanted to circle back just on the Blues settlement. And I know it\u2019s early here in terms of how this ultimately may affect the broader Blues landscape. But just, answer - so Gail, I guess, two parts.  One, do you think that ultimately this could lead to a renewal over time of the Blues consolidation theme, which obviously has been dormant for the last 15 years or so? And then also just from a strategy perspective, for Anthem, whether, the elimination of the Blues rules would lead you to think about doing larger non-Blues acquisitions over time? \nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Scott. And, as I said before, our strategy, which we laid out at Investor Day has remained incredibly consistent. And so, we don\u2019t see this changing our strategy. We have significant opportunities to partner with Blues, as part of our diversified business group. We\u2019ve been very successful in selling in services and IngenioRx offers other opportunities.  And as you know, from our Medicaid and Medicare business, we\u2019ve done a number of partnerships with them well and recently Ingest announced actually a partnership in our group Medicare. So, I think, from our perspective, as I said before, I see \u2013 I really don\u2019t see this changing our stated strategy and I think that we are very excited about the growth prospects we have across Anthem. So, thanks very much for that question.  With that, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. As we shared today, Anthem is not a blow path for growth across our enterprise driven by our commitment to deliver a simpler, more affordable, and more effective healthcare experience for those that we are privileged to serve.  As always, I want to express my gratitude to our associates for their unwavering commitment to our customers, members and communities during this most challenging time for our country.  As you can see, we remain committed to delivering a simpler, more affordable and personalized experience for those we serve. And I look forward to building on our momentum throughout 2020. Thank you for your time and your continued interest in Anthem. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 A.M. today through November 27th 2020.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Anthem's third quarter 2020 earnings call. Today, we will discuss our third quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year against the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We will also provide a preliminary view of the headwinds and tailwinds we project heading into 2021.  This morning, Anthem reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, down 14% over the prior year quarter. Our results in the quarter reflects the impacts of ongoing COVID-19 treatment costs, the continued return of a more traditional utilization environment, as well as our ongoing commitment to address financial imbalances to our customers and members.  Since the onset of the health crisis, I've been incredibly proud of the way Anthem has continued to respond as a trusted health partner. Beginning with the earlier days of the crisis, we pivoted quickly and look for opportunities to serve in new ways to address the evolving needs of our customers and members and to make a positive difference in the lives we serve.  Armed with our purpose of improving the health of humanity, Anthem has continued to leverage our insights, innovation and partnership to improve lives and deliver a simpler, more affordable and more effective healthcare experience. The heart of Anthem is our local legacy and longstanding focus on the communities where we live and work.  Today, those communities are struggling with issues around food and security and health disparity, social unrest and economic challenges. Our focus on community health fueled by our $50 million commitment seeks to eliminate health disparities and racial inequity. Our passion for this work is driven by our strong track record of addressing true, whole person care, is a social drivers of health.  Throughout the pandemic, we have been connecting with our high risk members, screening for key health factors around housing, food and transportation, as well as ensuring that they have access to basic necessities such as face masks, hand sanitizers and cleaning supplies.  Food and security is not a new issue in America, but the pandemic has only intensified the problems. We know food and security is directly linked to the whole health of individuals, families, communities and businesses. Together with our partner Feeding America, we are calling on leaders across the country to join together to fight hunger and improve the health of our nation.  Here in Indianapolis, we've committed with our partners to provide 10 million meals to local residents in need through mobile food banks and program outreach. Anthem has also partnered with Aunt Bertha, a leading social care network help connect individuals and families for free and reduced cost social services in their communities.  These programs include COVID-19 specific assistance with food, transportation, job training and more in every zip code across the country. Supporting efforts to create a more just society is an ongoing priority at Anthem. In light of the health disparities and racial inequities laid there by the pandemic, our work in this area has only accelerated.  For our associates, we continue to reinforce our strong culture and drive an inclusive environment for everyone. And in the City of Indianapolis, we are lending our voice and commitment, the INDY Racial Equity Pledge. This pledge spotlights our joint commitment with the local business and civic community to take meaningful actions to address the issues of health and racial equity towards the goal of a more just community for everyone.  We were also pleased to recently be named to Forbes Annual List Of The Most Just Companies ranking number one in the healthcare sector the second year in a row.  We know this year's flu season is going to be particularly challenging for our communities in combination with the rising spread of COVID-19. In response, Anthem has launched our Fall Flu Campaign, partnering with over 100 community-based organizations across our markets to stand up more than 500 pop-up and drive-thru clinics providing free flu shots in underserved neighborhoods.  Anthem is continuing to lead and shape our industry for the digital future and our experiences with COVID-19 have only accelerated our innovative efforts in this space. Our Sydney Health Application has more than 2 million unique downloads is helping ensure our members get the care they need where and when they need it. Sydney is delivering personalized engagement, and real-time access to health information, telehealth services and AI symptom-based triage.  Psych Hub is providing a range of mental health resources designed to help consumers and their families cope with the pandemic-related stress brought on by social isolation, job loss, and other challenges. This resource hub is a collaboration among several national leaders in the mental health community. Telehealth usage has been strong and we see that trend continuing, particularly for behavioral health services.  Since the onset of the health crisis, telehealth now comprises 40% to 50% of all behavioral health services compared to low-single-digit utilization pre-COVID. At Investor Day last year, we shared our vision for modernizing our business by consolidating our systems platforms, automating and reimagining processes and embedding digital and AIs across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience.  The charge this quarter enables us to enhance our speed to market as an enterprise to streamline our operations, accelerate our digital journey and ultimately deliver a better experience for those we serve.  Our experience in the last several months of the pandemic saw the pivot quickly to operate virtually and challenge our ways of working. With the insights from this experience, we are reimagining our workplace to the reduced real estate footprint, more selectable work practices and evolving our offices to serve as collaboration spaces when safely able to do so.  Membership trends in the quarter were strong despite the challenging economic environment. Medical membership totaled 42.6 million members, an increase of 172,000 lives sequentially, driven by continued robust organic growth and market share gains in Medicaid and Medicare. This was partially offset by attrition in our commercial business, as a result of the prevailing economic environment.  The risk of a more significant deterioration in our membership is real. But thus far, our overall membership trends are outperforming internal expectations. Our commercial membership declined 0.9% sequentially, which beat expectations in both our risk and fee-based businesses. New account sales supported by new virtual strategies and tools outpaced lapses for the second consecutive quarter despite the challenging environment.  In the Large Group segment, net new Large Group risk sales have exceeded lapses in the 11 of the last 13 months. Importantly, we remain discipline in our pricing and go to market strategy keeping an eye on long-term customer retention.  While we expect to see some headwinds from in group changes over the next several quarters, our focus on sales effectiveness, affordability, and offering a portfolio of product options to meet customers where they are continues to pay-off.  While the 2021 selling season looks different than most, our results year-to-date increase our confidence through sustained momentum in new sales growth, powered by our focus on whole person health. Our Medicaid membership grew by nearly 390,000 lives in the quarter and is up nearly 18% year-to-date due primarily to the pause on re-verification.  The financial performance of our Medicaid business in the quarter was significantly impacted by retroactive, prior period rate adjustments, that totaled nearly $300 million.  As we previously shared, our second quarter results were impacted by the broad based deferral of normal healthcare utilization, while the experience in the third quarter reflects a considerable increase in COVID-related costs, which we expect persists through the balance of the year more than offsetting the impacts of deferred utilization.  We continue to work with our state partners to achieve reimbursement levels that are actuarially found while earning a reasonable return on capital and margins in the 2% to 4% range.  Turning to the Medicare business, our growth of more than 16% year-to-date is outperforming the market average and we expect another year of mid-double-digit growth in 2021. The recently released star scores for payment year 2022 however are disappointing. Our pharmacy scores remain the single largest driver of our underperformance.  As a reminder, our Medicare Advantage members transitioned to IngenioRx on January 1, 2020, which limited our ability to improve our pharmacy scores in the latest measurement period. We are intensely focused on our star ratings with significant improvement expected over the next year. We are seeing a strong start to the annual enrollment period demonstrating that our multi-channel approach is delivering results.  Digital platforms have long been an area of focus even prior to the pandemic and this year, we expect to gain a significant percentage of our sales through digital channels. The development of our Medicare Care Guide is just one way we are enhancing our members' onboarding experience with proactive outreach to help them understand their benefits and enhance the onboarding process and overall new member experience.  Our 2021 offering reflects our industry-leading supplemental benefits, which include the popular over-the-counter offering, transportation, dental and vision benefits, as well as benefits to address social drivers of health such as food delivery and service animal care, positioning us for another year of above market growth Medicare Advantage.  Importantly, we expect to see nearly 90% of our members in $0 premium plans for 2021 as we continue to the fourth quarter, our compassionate commitment to making a positive difference for all of our stakeholders will continue.  With that, I will now turn the call over to John for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and our preliminary review of the headwinds and tailwinds we project heading into 2021. John? Yes. Thanks, Steve. I'll just also reiterate what John just said, which is, we have been investing what we found is that there is an opportunity to accelerate those investments as a result of the increased adaption that we've seen over the course of the pandemic, particularly in our digital assets, where we made significant commitments around our Sydney and our Psych Hub and other things where we are seeing our consumers more actively engage with those assets.  And then, stars is obviously a key priority for us and we continue to build a team there as well as invest in ensuring that we can pull through what we are doing in our pharmacy now that we have an under IngenioRx.  Thank you very much. Next question please. Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, AJ. Let me start now, have John provide a little bit more color. As you said, at this early stage, our view of 2021 would affirm our long-term EPS growth rate of 12% to 15% off the guidance of 2020 to 2030 as you mentioned.  Although as John commented in his prepared remarks it's skewed towards a little over a half of the range, just given the unusual risk and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic. So with that, let me have John give you a little bit more color on some of the other specifics that you asked in your question. John? Thanks very much. Next question please? Thank you. Next question please? Thank you. Next question please? Sure. Thanks for the question. I am going to ask Felicia Norwood to address some of your specific questions about reverification and timing of rates. But in terms of your very specific question about the all-in, what we expect that to be, as I said in my prepared remarks, $300 million was what we had in the quarter and we are expecting, obviously given where utilization goes and things that could move a little bit around $500 million would be that number. But with that, let me ask Felicia speak to the other questions you had. Felicia? Thank you. Next question please? Next question please? Felicia? Thanks, Felicia. Next question please? Thanks for the question, Kevin. In terms of the settlement that we announced today in the financials, we will be including in our 10-Q a much more fulsome discussion. So, just to give you a perspective of that, which will be filed this morning. BCBSA and the Blue plans have approved the settlement agreement and relief to the subscriber settlement as part of the case.  If approved, which the court still has to review it requires us to make the monetary settlement which we took our portion of its part of the third quarter charge. But also, there are a couple of non-monetary terms. One, eliminating the national best efforts rule in our license agreement.  And the second is allowing for some larger national employers with self-funded benefits to be able to request to bid for insurance coverage from a second Blue plan in addition to the local Blue plan.  As you know, we fully accrued our estimated liability in the third quarter of 2020. In terms of the impact of that, we view our strategy has been very consistent and don't really see any changes in our overall strategy. Thanks for the question. Next question please? Yes. Thanks for the question. Josh. I am going to have Pete Haytaian response to that on the commercial business. Thank you. Next question please? Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll have Pete add additional more color. But I as I shared in our opening remarks, we feel really good about our ability to increase our sales relative to our lapses.  And so, while this has been a very unusual year, we are still seeing particularly in the mid and lower \u2013 our small group business we are seeing really strong results because of our sales effectiveness. But I'll have Pete give you a bit more, because I think the work that his team has done over the last two years is really showing results this year. Thank you. Next question please? Well, thank you very much for the question. Just real quickly, when we start with the planned switching, we do expect less switching this year as people are shopping less. We've had a strong and growing amount of sales from our digital channels and we do think that that is going to be particularly strong.  Early returns are showing that already. Obviously, face-to-face during a time of COVID is a little more difficult. So, again, we are expecting a very strong \u2013 strong results as I shared in our opening comments around Medicare Advantage and digital will be a very big part of that. Thank you next question. Yes. So I think there is two areas of the charge that I just want to make sure. One is around the reduction in the footprint, because we are reimagining our office space. And again, we are going to still be an office-based company and we will still have a presence in all of the states where we do business. But what we've learned as part of the pandemic is that, we are really going to change the nature of those bases and consolidate the number of them we have in each of it, places that we work.  In terms of the investments we made, those are all very consistent with what we discussed back in Investor Day last year. And again, what we've learned as part of the pandemic is an acceleration of both our ability to implement. So acceleration of digital that we've been building, that needs a great examples, Psych Hubs and other ones, telehealth.  All of those things we've seen consumers much more readily adapt and use than we had even predicted and so part of that is accelerating that and how our workflows and business processes as part of what we've been doing, we embarked on an initiative to really simplify our operating environment to improve experiences for consumers to take out redundant steps, improve how we reach out to consumers, use AI-enabled claim adjudication.  So, things along that nature. Very consistent, but it's \u2013 again an acceleration that we see in usage pick up dramatically. So we've been able to accelerate the work that we are doing. Thanks for the question and next question please. Next question please? Well, thanks for the question, Whit. You know, as we think about policies, obviously, in our government business, that continues to be and I think part of the guideposts really are about and where we are in the pandemic and access to care. Right now, we are seeing offices open and we are seeing individuals to have access to care clearly as long as there is a serious issue on COVID and the pandemic.  And we are seeing rise in cases. It's something that we continue to evaluate. There is a lot of uncertainties right now and a lot of questions. Timing into vaccine, expanded testing which we continue to model pent-up demand and we are seeing as we mentioned that going above the baseline. So we are seeing people access care, which is important.  And remember, our goal is also, we are reaching out to make sure that people have the right access to care particularly those we know who have multiple kind of conditions across our book of business. So, in terms of that, we continue to model it. We continue to look at it and our goal is to ensure that we have appropriate access to care.  And that is, we are learning a lot more about each of the events that are happening with COVID. Thanks for the question and next one please? In terms of the second question, why do we feel confident about our growth projections? There are few things. One, I shared in my opening comments, which is really very strong product offering. We expect 90 plus percent of our members to be in or have access to zero premium plans. Our supplemental benefits continue to be some of the strongest offerings in this space.  And then third, we believe that there is still significant opportunity in our states to expand. I mean, right now, we don't have number one market share in many of those states and there is growth. We do have number one market share in the commercial space and our Blue brand is incredibly strong in those states. And then states where we are selling outside our Blue brand, we also are seeing some really nice momentum.  We have partnerships and joint ventures with our Blue rather. And so, again, we are seeing a lot of momentum. Our brand resonates well. Our digital channels are also resonating very well in terms of the sales to marketplace. So, overall, while we don't have a significant \u2013 we have some expansion.  We expect to gain market share in our states and we do think that our 85 new counties that we've entered will also help us. But again, we feel our offerings are very strong and are resonating quite well. Thank you. Next question please. Well, thanks for the question. I think, while you are focused on vaccines, no one really has the ultimate answer at this stage, where we are watching the situation very closely and learning about the potential. We've modeled a lot of scenarios into our pricing. There is a number of variables, obviously around vaccines including when they'll be available from as early as January, or is it summer of 2021.  Clearly, dosing requirements, vaccination rates, storage, transportation, whole lot of things. I mean, that obviously goes to say that there is a ton of variables. But remember, vaccines are only one cost of COVID in total. We are looking at the total cost of COVID and I wouldn't look at this into cancellation. Our goal obviously is to advocate to protect our highest risk members first.  So, again that gets to the timing. But we also understand that CMS is going to be providing guidance at some point and we'll obviously look to follow their lead accordingly. Thank you. Next question please. Yes. And I just like to reiterate too, it's a one-time charge. So just so we are clear about that. Thank you, John. I think we have time for one last question. Well, thanks for the question, Scott. And, as I said before, our strategy, which we laid out at Investor Day has remained incredibly consistent. And so, we don't see this changing our strategy. We have significant opportunities to partner with Blues, as part of our diversified business group. We've been very successful in selling in services and IngenioRx offers other opportunities.  And as you know, from our Medicaid and Medicare business, we've done a number of partnerships with them well and recently Ingest announced actually a partnership in our group Medicare. So, I think, from our perspective, as I said before, I see \u2013 I really don't see this changing our stated strategy and I think that we are very excited about the growth prospects we have across Anthem. So, thanks very much for that question.  With that, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. As we shared today, Anthem is not a blow path for growth across our enterprise driven by our commitment to deliver a simpler, more affordable, and more effective healthcare experience for those that we are privileged to serve.  As always, I want to express my gratitude to our associates for their unwavering commitment to our customers, members and communities during this most challenging time for our country.  As you can see, we remain committed to delivering a simpler, more affordable and personalized experience for those we serve. And I look forward to building on our momentum throughout 2020. Thank you for your time and your continued interest in Anthem."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning, Stephen and thanks for the question. As you mentioned, Medicaid growth had certainly been accelerated during this period, we're up 4.8% quarter-over-quarter and almost $389,000 over second quarter. And at this point, I don't know if we would back to the \u2013 just say when that peak is going to happen.  When you take a look at where we are today, states have spend at their reverification at least through the end of the public health emergency. That public health emergency right now will go through January 21st of next year. But in addition to the public health emergency, states are also receiving enhanced FMAP. So we would expect that states will continue to suspend reverification through the period of enhanced FMAP.  So that could be certainly through the end of January of next year as we head into February. We've been in constant conversations with our state partners with respect to continuity of care for our members, particularly during this time of a pandemic. And continuity of care is very important. So we work with our state partners trying to make sure that we are working closely around aborting any type of clip event.  So I am not sure at this point, when things are going to peak certainly as long as this has a continuation of the public health emergency and the enhanced FMAP that states are currently receiving. Thank you. Good morning, Sara and thanks for the question. As I said, I would expect that states would suspend reverifications at least through the public health emergency and the enhanced FMAP. Once that happens, states have the ability to control when they return to reverifications with respect to membership. What the Federal government requires is that, Medicaid members to have their eligibility redetermined at least what, every twelve months.  States can decide whether or not they want to then execute upon that beginning in the next quarter or thereafter, but you generally get through your entire Medicaid book of business over a twelve month period. So, as we take a look at our portfolio, which as you know is 23 states, all of those states will make determinations around when they commit reverifications at varying different intervals.  We are working very closely with our state partners and they've been very collaborative with us around helping us to educate members around the reverification process and what's necessary, once that reverification process commences. But the return to reverification, the timing, the cadence around when that happens with respect to membership is certainly left with the state partners in terms of when that happens."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, a decline of 14% year-over-year. While our GAAP quarterly results included a few significant charges, our adjusted earnings were otherwise relatively consistent with our overall expectations.  Our results reflect the departure from normal seasonality trends due to the continued impact of COVID-19 utilization, as well as the actions we voluntarily took to support our members, customers, communities, and care providers.  We continue to offer expanded benefit policy changes to adjust cost share waivers for COVID-19 treatment has access to 24/7 telehealth at no cost, provided grants and support for our communities to name a few.  Our adjusted third quarter results exclude our expected share of the impending Blue Cross, Blue Shield Litigation settlement, as well as the charges related to the business optimization efforts that Gail referenced earlier.  The impending Blue Cross and Blue Shield litigation settlement removes an uncertain while the business optimization charges are the latest milestone in our journey of delivering on our commitment to achieving an SG&A ratio of 11% to 12% by 2023.  These initiatives are aligned with our enterprise strategy and represent a reallocation of resources in high growth and high impact areas such as AI and digital. After transitioning the majority of our associates to work from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to reassess and further optimize our real estate footprint as we gained a better understanding of our organization's capacity to work from home.  Anthem's third quarter operating gain was $201 million, a decline of $1.3 billion from the prior year. Absent the aforementioned major adjustment items, operating gain in the quarter declined 8% or $126 million. Our underlying results reflect elevated COVID-19-related cost across our commercial and government lines of business and retroactive Medicaid rate adjustment, partially offset by deferred healthcare utilization and strong performance in IngenioRx.  Medical membership was 42.6 million members at the end of September, growth of more than 1.6 million lives year-to-date. This growth is further evidence that Anthem has the most balanced and resilient membership mix in the sector. Time and time again, we have shown the ability to grow at stronger comps which was illustrated by industry-leading organic membership growth in 2019, as well as during periods of economic uncertainty, as we have continue to grow membership throughout 2020. Since the end of the first quarter, enrollment in Medicaid has grown by more than double, a decline in our employer group businesses, excluding Blue Card.  As a matter of fact, our Medicaid membership growth is approximately ten times the decline in our commercial risk-based members. And of course, this is going on while we continue to exhibit double-digit growth year-over-year in our Medicare Advantage.  Operating revenue in the third quarter of 2020 was $30.6 billion, an increase of approximately 16% versus the prior year quarter, and nearly 15% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher premium revenue from solid growth in our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Pharmacy revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx and the return of the health insurer fee. The increase was partially offset by risk-based enrollment declines in our commercial and specialty business driven by higher unemployment rates. The medical loss ratio in the third quarter was 86.8%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year.  On a HIF-adjusted basis, MOR in the quarter increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by increased cost related to COVID-19 including actions to support our members, customers and providers in addition to the retroactive Medicaid rate adjustments.  Non-COVID utilization in the third quarter largely returned to normal levels or roughly 95% of historical baseline. And when coupled with the cost of COVID-19 care, overall utilization was above baseline. As discussed on our second quarter call, we continue to expect the second half mix adjusted MOR to come in a couple hundred basis points higher than normal seasonality trends would suggest, driven by COVID-19 cost and the continued recovery in non-COVID utilization throughout the remainder of the year.  Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 17.3%, an increase of 440 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. However, excluding major adjustment items, SG&A in the quarter was 13.4%, reflecting an increase of 50 basis points. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with return of the health insurer fee, and increased spend to support growth, partially offset by growth of operating companies.  We experienced an operating cash outflow of $1.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by the payment of the health insurers fee for the full year, as well as the timing of two additional federal tax payments that were previously deferred as permitted by the IRS.  For the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow was $6.9 billion, or 1.7 times to net income. Excluding the impacts, net income from the major adjustment items in the quarter are multiple of cash flow to net income year-to-date would have been 1.4 times.  Turning to the balance sheet, our debt-to-cap ratio was 39.2% at the end of the third quarter, which is consistent with our target range. Days and claims payable was 41.1 days, down from 46 days at the end of the second quarter, but up 1.3 days year-over-year with the medical claims liability increasing 14% versus growth in premium revenue of 11% over the same period, evidence of our solid reserve.  In the quarter, we've repurchased 2.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $265.73 for a total cost of $759 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased 5 million shares at an average price of $269.15 or $1.3 billion in total cost. 2020 has been unprecedented in many ways with much still unclear on the future course of the pandemic and the macro economy.  However, we are proud of our organization's ability to adapt, providing care for those we serve and delivering relief and support to our stakeholders. At this time, we remain committed to our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of greater than $22.30. As you have heard this morning, we have consistently demonstrated strong performance despite operating in an environment characterized by uncertainty.  While COVID-19 is certainly introduced many challenges, our long-term growth plan remains firmly intact as we seek to gain share in the Medicare Advantage market, leveraging growth at diversified business groups, increased the profitability of our fee-based business and modestly grow share in the commercial risk-based business.  Importantly, we invite you to attend our Virtual 2021 Investor Day Meeting on March 3rd, where we will discuss our long-term strategy in greater detail. As it relates to 2021 guidance, we will provide a more detailed outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.  Further, as you contemplate the headwinds and tailwinds, we see for next year, please keep in mind there is much more uncertainty than the normal given the unknowns related to COVID such as the timing, and efficacy of a vaccine, or if we could see another round of deferred utilization.  With that as background, our initial view of 2021 contemplates the following tale; the permanent repeat of the health insurer fees, which we use to partially offset investment in our Medicare business to improve our star scores, accretion from the 2020 M&A activity and share repurchases, IngenioRx growth and the continued progress on our commercial 5 to 1, to 3 to 1 strategy and Medicare Advantage membership growth. These will be partially offset by Medicaid reverifications and raid actions in the context of return to a normal operating environment. Commercial enrollment pressure, primarily in-group change as a result of broader economic challenges and higher investment spending to support long-term growth.  At this early stage, our view of 2021 would affirm our long-term EPS growth rate of 12% to 15% albeit skewed to the lower half given the unusual risk and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic.  And with that, operator we will now open the call for questions. Yes. Thank you, Steve. Appreciate the question. And, the higher investment spending really is, putting more and more money into our AI and digital capabilities, investing more in stars in order to ensure that we improve our number of members covered by four star plan in the next rating period and beyond.  And, really the way that that care is going to be accessed here in the future is slightly different than how it's been accessed in the past from really investing in the various networks and capabilities to meet the customers where they need to be met. So, we'll provide a lot more specificity on that at Investor Day in terms of automating and reimagining processes and embedding digital and AI across the enterprise.  It's all about simplifying and improving the customer experience. So, hopefully that can provide you a little bit of context here in the mean time. Yes. Thank you, Gail. And, good morning, AJ. Our 2021 trend expectations and really I think you maybe pointing to commercial pricing actions are very important, obviously many variables they have considered as part of our trend and our pricing assumptions. And I'll just be clear for everyone on the call here for competitive reasons, we are not going to provide a specific point estimate of where we see trend coming or what our pricing assumptions are at this point in time.  But I do think it would be instructive to highlight some of the things are considered. First of all, there is a permanent repeal the health insurer fee and that repeal actually is going to save Anthem customers or actually $2 billion in 2021 and certainly we removing its burden helps mitigate the impact of cost. And also, really looking closely at how will care be accessed in 2021.  For instance, telehealth, ER visits, standalone surgery centers, other site of service changes, how are they going to evolve before and after a vaccine is available, And overall utilization be impacted or just it's the way that CARES Act. Certainly, we are trying to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 testing and treatment, assessing how much pent-up demand still exists versus the permanent cancellation of procedures. And then how is deferred utilization impacted underlying acuity.  And like, the list goes up, those are all just variables that are incremental and on top of the normal variables that exists each and every year when we assess trends. So, the one thing I'll say with all of that though, is that we are being very disciplined in our approach and we are being very disciplined in our pricing.  Our pricing covers forward trend. We have committed that. We were priced to cover forward trend and we'll continue to do so. So we'll provide more insights into this in early 2021 questions on our fourth quarter call next January. And of course, as I stated on March 3rd during our Virtual Investor Day provide a lot more insights.  But these are many of the variables that we are really working our way through right now as we finalize our 2020 year.  Thank you, AJ Hey, Justin, I apologize. Can you repeat the first half of your two-part question? I am not sure I understood everything you said. Oh the net if tailwind, okay. Yes. The HIF, as I said, that was part of the overall headwinds and tailwinds that we had and in response to AJ's question, we've certainly tried to factor everything into our headwinds and tailwinds as part of reaffirming our long-term growth rate and really don't want to get into cherry picking certain items as to why something as part of a starting point and my something else is not right. On HIF and of itself, we are looking at $0.60 to $0.80 of a tailwind in 2021 associated with the permanent repeal of that law.  Related to \u2013 as we said, part of it's going to be is to help fund some of the investments in Medicare to improve star ratings and other things. So, there is certainly a lot of fungibility associated with any number of headwinds or tailwinds, but $0.60 to $0.80, I think is the dollarized impact of the question.  Related to the 2021 and the Medicaid rate environment, obviously we are working very closely with the states to ensure that we get actuarially appropriate rates working through whether it be the collars of the corridors and how those things are impacting the methodology, I think we'll advice very wide open in terms of that. And as I said, conversations with our state partners regarding the need to have sound rates as we quickly return to a normal operating environment.  So, our expectation is, is that, we'll be able to achieve a appropriate return on capital and operate well within the target margin range in Medicaid in 2021 and are actually focused on being relatively close to the midpoint of that range. Sure. Thank you, Ricky for that question. And maybe I'll provide some context that might answer questions that are in the queue as well in terms of your question. So, if you look at the underlying claims that we are seeing, as I stated in my prepared comments that, they are, excluding COVID would be below baseline levels.  But then, when you add COVID cost back in, we are exiting the third quarter at greater than baseline. So, we started the third quarter with a combination of both underlying procedures and COVID cost being below baseline and we ended the quarter with the combination to being above baseline. We fully expect that the fourth quarter would be above baseline for the entire quarter given the recent surge in COVID, as well as all the other trends that we are seeing.  Associated with where we are seeing some of the rebound, outpatient surgery has recovered the fast as pre-COVID and it's actually even trending above baseline in some instances. Some of the more costly procedures such as joint replacement surgeries have come back faster.  And a lot of that was anticipated and the actions we took to intentionally redirect care to the outpatient setting to ensure continuity of care are coming through. And to that end, we are focused on ensuring our members are getting the care they need in a timely manner, whether it be through telehealth or by redirecting certain procedures to outpatient setting.  The ER utilization is still below baseline at this point in time and we expect that to continue for a while as well. So, we are clearly taking all these things to consideration as we look at 2021 trends and as I stated for competitive reasons, we are not committing to a point estimate at this \u2013 on this call. But there is a natural system capacity constraint that will cause some utilization to carry into 2021 and we are certainly factoring that work off. Thank you for the question, Ricky. Yes. Ralph, thank you for the questions. In terms of target margins associated with Medicaid, we have \u2013 as you know, we have well over a half of our states are January 1 renewals and we are working very closely with them on rate actions. And that the trend information that's utilized for January 1 renewals is typically the two prior years.  So, 2018 and 2019 are the \u2013 really the actuarially sound rate information we have associated with that. So, we feel very good about how those conversations are going and where those rates are coming out. In terms of 2020, it's an interesting dynamic with all the deferred utilizations, the increase in COVID costs, some of the call backs of premiums, all in, we are \u2013 as you know, we've had a $22.30 EPS guidance that we reaffirmed.  The overall margins within Medicaid are coming out within the target margin range, but there is a lot of variables and lot of hard work to get there. But clearly, we are trending in the right direction during this period of uncertainty. Associated with the membership, as you know, we feel very good about our membership.  We think we have the most resilient membership mix in the business. We grow in periods of strong economic times. We grow in periods of economic uncertainty. And we made a cognizant decision here in 2020 that, we would help address the imbalances and inequities in the system created by the pandemic. So, as our membership continues to get stronger and stronger, we are helping give it back to maintain our guidance.  And then, lastly, in terms of the fourth quarter, we do expect the fourth quarter to have an elevated medical loss ratio and that's because the underlying cost of services, plus the pent-up demand that is partially coming through, plus the COVID cost that we are covering on top of all of that, we expect to be above baseline. And so, we are usually looking at a 300 to 350 basis point MOR in the fourth quarter higher than what normal seasonality would suggest. But thank you for those questions. Thank you for the questions, George. I'll start with your last question first. Our long-term stated growth rate is still 12% to 15%. There is no intention of tightening that and we do believe that the 12% to 15% range is a sustainable range that we can deliver on for quite some time. The comment about being too lower end was just really due to an overabundance of caution, given the uncertainties related to the entire pandemic and COVID situation.  Related to the utilization question at the beginning, we have done really a lot of sophisticated modeling. Our various scenarios that we modeled since the beginning of the crisis have been going on and we constantly updated and incorporate new learnings in the model as the pandemic is involved. The recovery in utilization maybe lumpy.  We do believe our assumptions are very sound. As I stated I think in an answer to an earlier question, there will be some natural system capacity constraint that we do believe will cause some utilization to naturally carryover into 2021. And just to be clear, yes, we have tried to think through all of those and incorporate all of those variables into our 2021 thought process.  And then, as I stated before, we are pricing the cover forward trend. And so, our expectation is, is that, that we will cover forward trends in terms of our pricing and our revenue associated with price differences. Thank you. Thank you, Dave. I'll answer the first half of the question associated with the MOR. Yes, the fourth quarter of 2018, of course doesn't need to be mix adjusted a bit for the fact that our membership mix has changed. But the fourth quarter of 2018 is as good of a starting point as any from a comparative basis to look at that 300, 350 basis point increase that I referenced. Yes. Hey. Good morning, Gary. And thank you for the questions. Yes, first of all in the business optimization, we did certainly exclude the charge here in the third quarter. And the benefits associated with that will certainly come through over a period of years and become part of our runrate cost savings associated with the administrative structure of this company.  And again, as we had talked about, we have got our plan to get to a 11% to 12% SG&A ratio by 2023 that we have referenced at our Investor Day and this is certainly one step to get there. The other part of the question or the answer I would say is that, we've also talked about incrementally investing really putting more money into the digital and AI, putting more money into the stars type of investments and we are obviously not going to exclude any of those cost from our numbers.  So, 2021, we think should be fairly clean from that perspective that we'll have some savings and we'll have some reinvestment opportunities to really help position the company much, much better for the future. Yes. This year, yes, thank you. And then, on the share repurchase, we've repurchased approximately $1.3 billion through the end of September. We have a increased share repurchase pace a bit here in the third quarter, especially when our stock price was really down, we thought far greater than what it could or should have been based on a PE multiple perspective.  We are obviously going to be opportunistic and watchful of market conditions. Our stated goal is to reinvest about 50% of our free cash flow into either M&A or back into the business, 30% in the share buyback and 20% in the dividends. As I've stated, I do believe that those buckets are going to be appropriate over a five year period of time.  They will never be exactly correct in any one quarter. And probably not even exactly correct in any one full year. But I would expect that we would continue our share buyback here in the fourth quarter and maybe end the year little bit higher than what we've been in the last couple of years, just given the weakness in the stock price that we saw.  And then head into 2021 from there. But at the end of the day, we need to be opportunistic with our capital and ensure that it's being allocated appropriately. Thank you, Gary."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please, go ahead.\nChris Rigg: Good morning and welcome to Anthem's second quarter 2020 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Good morning and thank you for joining us for Anthem\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Since our last earnings review, our business has continued to evolve and respond to the ongoing health crisis and social justice issues facing society. The impacts of these events are profound for associates, local communities, and all those we serve. Over the past several months, Anthem has continued to take bold steps to directly support those who need our help.  Last quarter, we took action to commit $2.5 billion in financial assistance, to ease the burden of COVID-19 among our members, employer, customers, air providers and non-profit partners. The needs are ongoing, and I'm proud of the way Anthem has responded quickly to provide needed support. We remain committed to creating a more affordable healthcare experience for our valued members and customers. To that end, we remove barriers to care by waiving cost sharing for treatment of COVID-19, including coverage for testing, treatment, and in-patient hospital stays. We also waive prior authorizations for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and related covered services. To date, we've paid approximately $500 million associated with COVID-19 related diagnoses. In addition, we provided our associates, individual and employer group customers with a one-month premium credit ranging from 10% to 15% while individuals on our standalone and group dental plans received a 50% credit. We continue to deliver value to our customers by providing them with flexible payment terms, as well as affordable buy down options as they navigate the crisis. Our unwavering commitment to our local communities is an integral part of our strategy and legacy at Anthem. For more than 75 years, we've understood the privilege and responsibility. We have to make positive change in the communities where we live and work. This commitment reflects our mission and all that we stand for. And it was at the heart of our recent $50 million pledge over the next five years to focus directly on health disparities, racial inequities, and the key drivers of health such as food and security, mental health, housing, and economic recovery. We know that food security is one of the most profound needs in the wake of the pandemic. A recent study showed that nearly 40% of households today report moderate to high levels of food insecurity, with children being impacted the most. To combat this trend, we are increasing our support as a leading national partner with Feeding America. Here in our home state of Indiana, we were pleased to recently announce a partnership with Gleaners Food Bank to provide more than 10 million meals as part of our $1 million matching grant to expand access to nutritious food. Our associates are doing their part to give back as well and it's inspiring. They're deeply committed to fulfilling our purpose, and have donated more than 27,000 hours of virtual volunteering with online mentoring, teaching, community outreach, along with donating much needed resources to local organizations, and today, our social responsibility efforts take a bold new step, as I am pleased to announce we are signing on to the UN Global Compact.  Now, more than ever, we recognize the important societal role we play to help shape a stronger, more inclusive, and more sustainable world. As we reflect on our performance, the quarter clearly demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and trust in the Anthem brand. Despite declines in our commercial business, losses were less than expected, particularly in our local group, risk-based business where in-group attrition was partially offset by new sales exceeding lapses. Medical enrollment increased by 1.6 million lives or nearly 4%, compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Putting that growth in perspective, Medicaid enrollment grew sequentially by nearly 10 times the decline in our risk-based employer group enrollment. The pandemic has impacted our Medicaid and Medicare populations particularly hard, and we have moved quickly to deliver true whole person care. Our customer care associates have been doing one-on-one outreach to our vulnerable members, ensuring access to food, safe housing, as well as guiding new members through on-boarding and helping them enroll in support programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. To date, we've reached out to 80% of our high-risk Medicaid and Medicare members, and this work continues. I remain grateful to our care provider partners for their ongoing work on the frontlines of care delivery. As part of our support to those partners, we've simplified policies and procedures, including temporarily suspending prior authorization requirements for patient transfers, oxygen supplies, respiratory devices, and multifunction ventilators, enabling them to focus on delivering exceptional care. In addition, we're extending financial support to targeted primary care physicians who are facing undue pressures during this period, as utilization slowly returns to normal levels. Our compassionate and committed care providers in CareMore, Aspire and HealthSun are beginning to return to direct care for our most vulnerable members. These touch points include the use of remote patient monitoring for a variety of chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure and COPD, along with in-home and online care and support. If we think about innovation, Anthem is helping shape our industry for the digital future. We are pioneering technologies to deliver personalized care designed to improve total health to help consumers manage their health and wellness at every stage of life. Digital first is the cornerstone of the future of healthcare. And our experiences with COVID-19 have only accelerated our efforts in this space. For employer customers and government partners, we recently launched the C19 Navigator and C19 Explorer tools to aggregate real time COVID-19 data to help inform and guide return to workplace decisions and resource planning. And for consumers, our Sydney Care solution is using data and AI to help individuals triage their own symptoms and seek care directly from their phone. To date, we've facilitated more than 475,000 telehealth visits in 82,000 COVID-19 assessments. As one of the first managed care companies to partner with Amazon Alexa, Anthem members can now use our new Anthem Skill, personal voice assistant to check their health plan details, schedule calls with customer representatives and renew prescriptions directly through their Alexa enabled devices. At its recent peak, virtual health visits by our members were up 300% relative to pre-COVID levels. Live health online, our on demand telehealth solution surpassed 1 million visits in early April and demand continues. Demand for telemedicine in the behavioral health space is also increasing with the usage at 56 times pre-COVID levels. Our Beacon behavioral health team has responded to this growing need and pivoted quickly to help transition care providers to a digital interface, enhance online supports and services for consumers and conduct outreach for our most at risk members to address special care needs. Collaborative partnerships continue to be a strategic focus in Anthem. We were pleased to join \u201cThe Fight Is In Us\u201d campaign, a results driven public private partnership focused on the promising use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to help improve outcomes and treatments for those with active infection. We're also pleased to serve as a founding partner of the XPRIZE pandemic alliance, working to help develop scalable tests that are rapid, accurate, and low cost. The alliance is a global coalition leveraging the power of collaboration, competition, and shared innovation to accelerate solutions that can be applied to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Looking ahead, we recognize there is much unknown regarding the magnitude and duration of this pandemic given the recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country. Despite this uncertainty, Anthem is well-positioned to achieve our 2020 EPS guidance and deliver on our longer-term financial goal. And with that, I will now turn the call over to John Gallina to discuss our financial results. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning. Since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked diligently to serve as a trusted partner for our members and care providers. We proactively committed $2.5 billion in financial support, including extended cost share waivers, premium credits, provided grants, and community support. And this is all while rolling out new and innovative solutions to maximize the health and well-being of our members. While much remains uncertain, we're guided by our values and are firmly committed to rectifying further imbalances for the benefit of our consumers. COVID-19 significantly impacted the normal seasonality inherent in our business as a result of the broad based deferral of healthcare utilization in the second quarter. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $9.20 in the second quarter, bringing year to date adjusted earnings per share to $15.68. The seasonality of our earnings will differ from our historic patterns. And as we have previously announced, we expect to earn approximately 70% of our annual total in the first six months of the year. Relative to our baseline financial expectations, aggregate utilization was 40% below expectations in April and 20% in May, as people nationwide adhered to shelter in place orders. Our June experience, while still early, suggests a utilization recovery to roughly 90% of baseline. Looking ahead, our guidance assumes the recent recovery in utilization persists and second half utilization comes in slightly ahead of our pre-COVID-19 baseline expectations. All in, we expect this dynamic to increase our second half medical loss ratio by a couple hundred basis points relative to what normal seasonality would have suggested. Medical membership totaled 42.5 million members at the end of the second quarter, reflecting an increase of 1.6 million members, representing nearly 4% growth over the prior year quarter. Even more impressive is that we grew during the second quarter, organically adding 309,000 net new members during these uncertain times. Government business enrollment grew by nearly 600,000 lives in the quarter, more than double the decline in commercial enrollment. Attrition in our commercial business has been less than expected today. However, we believe attrition is likely to accelerate when federal assistance expires. Nonetheless, we expect to mitigate declines in commercial enrollment through growth in our Medicaid and individual ACA businesses. We believe we have the most balanced and resilient membership mix in the sector. In periods of strong economic success, such as the company enjoyed in 2019, we grew our membership. In 2020, during more economically challenging times, we again have been able to grow our membership. Our strategy and business mix allows us to perform well in both positive and negative economic conditions. Overall, we're pleased with how our membership is trending. Results through the second quarter reflect our deliberate efforts to build a more diversified Anthem over the last decade, maintaining our strong commercial franchise, while establishing an industry leading Medicaid platform in a rapidly growing Medicare business. Operating revenue was $29.2 billion in the quarter, growth of nearly 16% over the prior year, and 14% on a HIF-adjusted basis. Growth and operating revenue was driven by the launch of IngenioRx and the related increase in product revenue, membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare, as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. Days and claims payable was 46 days, an increase of 4.1 days from the first quarter, and a 6.9 day increase from the second quarter of 2019. Given the uncertainty, we have taken a conservative posture related to our claims reserves. We expect [DCP] to decline to levels more in-line with historical norms as utilization rebounds in the second half of the year. Operating cash flow was very strong at 2.4 times net income. Cash flow in the quarter benefited from several timing related items, including the delay of certain federal and payroll tax payments in accordance with the CARES Act. In the third quarter, we'll be making three federal tax payments and the $1.6 billion health insurer fee payment.  As a reminder, we took a number of immediate actions in the first quarter to enhance our financial flexibility. We ended the second quarter with approximately $4.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.5%, a decrease of 220 basis points, compared to the 41.7% in the first quarter reflecting our enhanced liquidity position. With liquidity concerns not as prevalent as they were earlier in the year, we have resumed our share repurchase program and continue to expect to repurchase greater than $1.5 billion of shares for the year. To conclude, our performance in the quarter clearly demonstrates that the value of our diversified model is real. As we look ahead, we expect additional commercial enrollment attrition and strong growth in our Medicaid business. Thus far, COVID-19 is not significantly impacting our individual Medicare Advantage growth, which continues to enjoy a mid-double digit growth trajectory.  Although much remains uncertain about the impact and ramifications of the pandemic, our rigorous scenario analyses continue to support our original full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than $22.30. While we have reconfirmed our earnings per share guidance, we continue to withhold guidance on all other metrics. And with that, we will now open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So, you've maintained guidance as you assume some return to normalization in the back half of the year, can you give us some more color on what you're seeing in specific regions where COVID cases are coming back? Obviously, there have been some reports that some of the places are deferring [indiscernible] again, how should we think about the [net deferred] [ph] coming back from being deferred in second Q versus second half?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Ricky. Appreciate the question. You know, and it's certainly an understatement to say that there's a lot of uncertainty associated with the situation, but you know, we still have a lot of pent-up demand from the second quarter, and you know, we have extended payment of covering co-pays and deductibles for COVID-19 treatment. And in addition, we're providing reimbursement for PPE for dental providers, as well as other benefits we're providing to the provider community. And while an increase in the COVID and the recent spike we have certainly may cause more deferred procedures, right now, we're not expecting a full shutdown of the system similar to what we experienced in April. And so given all the variables, we still do believe that a reasonable estimate will be that our second half medical loss ratio will be about 200 basis points higher in the last part of the year versus what would be expected under normal circumstances. And I guess the only other comment is to note that we did provide the $2.5 billion of value to the system as a result of what's going on. And if non-emergent utilization drops significantly again, you know, we'll certainly take appropriate actions to help address whatever imbalance exist associated with that. So, appreciate the question, but we really do think that the $22.30 EPS guidance is really the best guess right now.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Ricky. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake with Wolf Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions on Medicaid. Can you talk about your \u2013 what you saw in membership in the second quarter in terms of lack of churn versus new membership? How you think about that\u2019s going to progress into the back half of the year? And then any comments on rate pressure and what we've built in for the assumption there into the 2020 guide would be helpful as well? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Justin. I'tm going to have Felicia comment, but I think, as you noted, we feel very strongly about the membership gains we saw, and specific to your question, the vast majority were due to the stopping of re-verification versus unemployment and other things that would have occurred during that time. But as we look at our overall membership growth, again, we feel we also gained share during this time as strong brand resonated. But I'll have Felicia maybe give you a little bit more color in terms of the discussions with the states. Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Thank you, Gail. And thank you for the question. Our Medicaid enrollment in the second quarter ended at approximately 8.2 million members. This was up 566,000 compared to the first quarter. And as Gail mentioned, that was primarily due to the temporary suspension of re-verifications. Our early indications for July as well indicates continued growth in the Medicaid program. We feel very good about our brand and we continue to grow share in the Medicaid space. You know, looking ahead, we believe we're well-positioned to be able to navigate whatever happens in this emerging environment. And the expectation is that we will continue to see Medicaid growth during this time. Roughly 13% to 15% of our members reside in states where Medicaid has [been standard] [ph]. So, while it's too early to quantify the potential impact, certainly if the unemployment rate increases, we would expect growth in our government business to certainly continue to offset any membership declines that might happen on the commercial side. In terms of your question with respect to rate, you know, we certainly won't disclose the amount of any of the experience rated refunds or rate actions, but as John mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects a reasonable view of both our known and expected rate actions and the experience rated refunds. You know, rates are required to be actuarially sound and we work with our state partners on a daily basis on developing rates that are going to be appropriate.  You know, the performance across our 24 markets varies even under normal circumstances, but as you know, some states are reopening and other states are seeing a resurgence in COVID cases. Roughly 15 of our states today have risk [quarters] [ph] or [callers] [ph] in place that effectively already limit managed care profitability within certain defined ranges and we are in discussions with other states that are also considering these kind of mechanisms, which really provides some predictability for both the states in our own business and really tries to ensure that risk is really properly balanced. We have a long history with our state partners, and we're going to continue to work through this with them, and make sure we are able to provide access to care to our members. And that really remains our foremost concern during this time. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Justin. And just sort of reiterating, I think what Felicia said, we feel that it's been very constructive dialogue with the states and you know, it's part of our model, that it's a continuous conversation that we're in with them, but overall from a growth perspective, and where we are from a share we feel quite good about our Medicaid performance. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Tanal with SVB Leerink. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tanal: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask on the segments, it looked like the government business, profit dollars, margin rate, you know, kind of maybe benefited more from COVID in the quarter anyway then the commercial side. I don't know if I'm reading too much into that, but just wanted to understand how the pandemic affected the two lines of business? And really separately, just following up on Felicia\u2019s comment just now, I think she said that you guys expect government enrollment to offset any changes on the commercial side going forward? So, wanted to clarify that, maybe get a little bit of context on just the mix shift between commercial and Medicaid and how you guys think about the profit dollars and the revenue associated with those two businesses and what is one commercial life worth on the Medicaid side, for example, that would be helpful? Thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Yeah, thank you for the question, Steve. First of all, in the segment reporting and in the benefit of the deferred utilization, it would be \u2013 the deferred utilization actually was a little bit more significant in the commercial market than it was in Medicaid, and then it was the least amount in Medicare in terms of the impact of the non-emergent procedures and the decreased cost structure. However, in the commercial segment, we provided the premium credits to the membership to all of our customers, you know, 10% to 15% on the local business and up to 50% on the specialty business, and the entirety of that was recorded in the second quarter for that entire premium credit. And so that's what is probably the reconciling item in your analysis when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter is that the premium credits are in the commercial market. And then the commercial market also has the premium cost share waivers for COVID testing and treatment that are part of the commercial results. Associated with the ongoing business and the profitability, we certainly have target margins on all of our businesses. And in the commercial marketplace, you know, the target margins on a fully insured business could easily be 5%, even high single digits, and that could easily work out based on average premium, the $25 to $30 PMPM operating game. However, on the ASO side, the fee revenue is obviously much, much less and a target profit on the fee side could be just $5 PMPM. And then you look over at the Medicaid, well Medicaid you have TANF and you have the higher acuity. There's a lot of variations there, but you know, even at a 2% to 4% op margin, which is our stated op margin for Medicaid, if you utilize the midpoint being 3%, based on the various premium volumes, you have maybe a $12 to an $18 target margin on a PMPM basis. So, as you can see when we lose a commercial member, depending on that if it's fully insured or ASO and it goes over to government, it could actually balance out quite nicely. That's one of the reasons that we continue to talk about how diversified our business mix is and how resilient our membership is, is because the profit margins on the various lines of business really help offset each other when there's a shift between the various areas. Thank you for that question.\nStephen Tanal: Helpful, thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Stephen, just a little clarification on the membership comment you said about the offset, I just want to clarify a couple things. One, as we look at our overall commercial enrollment, as we shared in our prepared remarks, we were down 290,000 lives, but as you think about unemployed appointment that was fairly muted and particularly so as our risk based lives. So, that was, we do expect, we think that furloughs have dampened that impact over the course of your day, but we feel are very resilient, quite frankly in our commercial business, and we're really pleased that our sales offset our lapses, actually, in the quarter as we look at our risk group business, so another sign that I think our teams have really put out some affordable products and have been doing a nice job of managing through this. But on overall basis, you know, we've often talked about having this large catcher's mitt of opportunity. I think clarifying what Felicia was saying a little more specifically, as you look at the quarter, and I shared in my remarks, are Medicaid outpaced our risk lives by 10 times, so clearly offset much of that. And also it's quite compelling when you're trading risk lives for fee based lives. So, a lot of our losses came in our self-funded ASO customers and we were able to generate much more in our risk life. So overall, we do expect as unemployment continues to lose more commercial lives. So, I don't want to leave you with the impression that we won't, but overall, we feel we had a very resilient catcher's mitt across our book of business. So thanks for the question. And next question please.\nStephen Tanal: Thank you.\nOperator: For our next question we\u2019ll go to A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Yeah, I guess the first thing is a tough one there, but anyway, good to hear from everyone. Maybe I'll just ask about Ingenio, obviously the ramp up and profitability was a big part of the story this year, how are you doing relative to your expectations there? How's the COVID situation impacting trends that you would have otherwise expected to see in a normal year and any comment on the selling season for the PBM as we get toward the end of that for 2021?\nJohn Gallina: Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the question. You know, IngenioRx is actually doing quite well and has really done a nice job of meeting our expectations. As you know, we really are in the Ingenio swing of things a full-year earlier than we had expected to, you know based on the original timeline of the ESI contract and being able to get out of that a year ahead. And so 2020 is actually a run rate year, as opposed to an implementation year. And, you know, in terms of the profitability itself, we made about 350 million in first quarter, 304 million here this quarter. And, you know, there's really a few key things going into that. You know the $4 billion in savings that we got from the better contract with CVS, and we've always talked about returning 20% of that to the shareholders, and \u2013 which would be $800 million. Well as we've gone through the first half of the year, and really tried to optimize and maximize the situation, and we believe that we're going to actually return closer to 900 million of that value throughout the course of 2020, and be part of our run rate on a go forward basis. Also Ingenio includes the shift of 75 million to 100 million of operating gain related to existing self-funded pharmacy customers that was previously recorded in the commercial segment, and is now being recorded in the Ingenio segment. And so that's all part of the situation. And then, you know, certainly any revenues or profits from third party business are included in Ingenio as well as that\u2019s helping with the overall profitability of the segment. And you know, the first quarter was benefited by the refill too soon relaxation of that edit. And we had an impact there that helped the first quarter to be, maybe higher than a run rate type basis, but you know, we really do believe that the second quarter is a good indication of what the run rate could be, maybe even a little bit better because as scripts, while maintenance scripts work consistent in the second quarter versus historical patterns, new scripts were down 10% to 15% in April. And so, actually the second quarter is probably the low end of a sustainable level for engineer for the future. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: In terms of the selling season, A.J., you know, it's been an interesting operating environment given all the change and I think we shared this in the last quarter, things are, I would say at least slightly delayed as customers try to work through their own stability across their business. While I think it's still early, I would say that our pipeline is still quite good. We are seeing some delays and overall decisions to move from 2021 to 2022, but overall, the sales cycle has been pretty active. We've seen, you know an increase year-over-year in that pipeline. We feel that one of our best opportunities is to embed IngenioRx in our own fee-based business and that's been going well. We're also pleased that we'll be adding Blue Cross of Idaho as part of our Medicare base in [1/1/2021]. So that's a nice add as well, as you know, we brought on the commercial business this year as part of the transition. So overall, I think we're probably going to expect some delays in the overall decision making for our largest customers, but we still feel very compelling sales proposition, particularly as we added to our self-funded business this year.  Thanks for the question. Next one please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Sara James with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSara James: Thank you. Could you talk a little bit more about the change in assumptions impacting DCP? Did the completion factor assumption move? Are you are you getting those a little bit slower and was there any impact on [indiscernible] that assumption change?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Sara. Great question on days and claims payable, and as we said that, days and claims payable is up 4.1 days, sequentially as well as 6.9 days year-over-year. And, you know, the days and claims payable is a function of many things and at time some of those changes can impact DCP without impacting the income statement, and we certainly have part of that going on with the way the math works. But we have seen an elongation of the amount of time it is has taken providers from the point of service to actually submitting the claims to us. So, you know, the cycle time of date of service to claim submission has gone up a couple days across our entire book of business during this pandemic, and you know, a lot of reasons for that, but really that would impact the days in claims calculation, all else being equal. Then also, given the fact that that occurred, I mentioned the conservatism in the prepared comments. We have then further made the completion factors a bit slower, given the uncertainty associated with the billing patterns that we wanted to ensure that we were totally covered. And, and so that would have caused our medical loss ratio to be a bit higher and our DCP to be a bit higher, and if it turns out that we need that we are fully covered. And if it turns out that there's a bit of conservatism, then that would be great. And we'll have some releases later in the year in the next year when we have more transparency into the situation. So, all those things taken, you know, then we also were able to have very, very solid cash flow as a percent of earnings as a result. So, I think they all point to very high quality of earnings. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Question around the commercial membership, I don't know if it's easy to answer, but do you have a sense of how many of your members at June quarter-end were unemployed or furloughed, but still receiving benefits? And I'm curious if there's any difference in your view, the ISO book versus the risk book? And then my real question is more around in that commercial book and the current environment, is it impacting your ability to \u2013 that strategic initiative to sell more services to existing members?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks. Josh. I\u2019m going to ask Pete Haytaian to answer. Please, Pete.\nPete Haytaian : Yeah. Thanks Josh, for the question. And as Gail said, the membership in the quarter ended up a lot better than we had originally expected with the broad unemployment. And as you refer to a big, you know cause of that was furloughs in terms of, you know, having deep insights to with respect to the exact amount of folks that are furloughed, I don't have that, you know, information at a precise level. So, I don't want to sort of make an assumption associated with that, but it definitely has been a big factor. The other thing that I had mentioned that's noteworthy is the makeup of our commercial book, which is really disproportionately in less risky segments. So, we have as you know a lot of state and government business accounts, as well as providing services for a lot of folks and essential services. So, we feel really good, you know about that. In terms of up-selling and selling more value into our ASO accounts, we have seen a bit of a slowdown when we talk about on the ASO side, improving our margins and going from 5 to 1 to 3 to 1, and you hear us talk a lot about us up-selling those services. And prior to COVID occurring, we were on a very strong path. I could say with great confidence that we would have likely, you know, been at around the 4 to 1 level. So, slightly ahead of, you know where we wanted to be, but as Gail noted, you know, when you think about things like pharmacy and you think about other, you know, value-added services that we provide, and that we're up-selling there has been a bit of a slow down because of COVID and a hesitation and folks deferring some of those decisions into 2021 and 2022. So, we have seen a little bit of a bump in the road, but as it relates to moving forward, we are very confident as we \u2013 on our path to the 3 to 1 and the value proposition is really selling. And as we are in COVID, we continue to innovate and deploy new programs. For example, you know, when we acquire a new asset like beacon, it creates a lot of additional opportunity for us to sell, for example, behavioral health services. So we feel very good about long-term. \nGail Boudreaux: And Josh the only other thing I'd add is, we've seen really strong retention of our accounts. So, the in-group attrition is obviously driving that, and that gets your question around furloughs versus you know, downsizing, and then the second thing and I'll just reiterate it, and I think the commercial team has really done an incredible job coming out of 2019, but also into this year, that our sales are outpacing labs. So, despite the environment, particularly in our risk-based business, we're continuing to see traction of the new product offerings and the segment focus that we put in under piece leadership. So, I think those are all contributing as well as I think just the makeup of our book is helpful there too. Next question please.\nOperator: For our next question we'll go to Stephen Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nStephen Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nStephen Valiquette: So, as we think ahead to the upcoming Medicare advantage annual enrollment period starting in October of this year for 2021, which is now really not that far away, just curious if you have any preliminary thoughts on whether you expect the overall MA market to see any disruption in enrollment growth due to COVID? Or do you think with greater technology and other factors, the industry can still overcome the risk of fewer face-to-face meetings with brokers, salespeople, etcetera, and still see MA growth in-line with historical averages? And can you talk about what Anthem is changing to combat this risk for your own Medicare growth outlook for next year? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Steve. Let me offer a few comments, and I'll ask Felicia, who leads that business to provide more detail. You know, we did, when the pandemic originally hit, we did see a slowdown in sales just because historically it has been face-to-face, but we've actually she recovered very nicely since over the last few months and I think, working with our brokers and others, we've been able to really put in much more direct selling and channels where there isn't as much face-to-face. So we've been working very diligently and as you look at our growth, you know, we've had very strong growth last year over 20%, and this year, quarter-over-quarter up 17% over prior year and 13% year-to-date and expect to continue to see the alternative methodologies we put in place. I\u2019ll ask Felicia to comment particularly about how we're ensuring the safety as well as how we're engaging with our Medicare Advantage members in particular. Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Yes, thank you, Gail. And Steve, thank you for the question. As Gail reference, we've seen strong performance in our business. We certainly had to pivot in-light of COVID and we saw a brief slowdown in our sales soon after COVID. But, you know, sales have actually picked up since that time and our early read on July membership indicates that performance is certainly improving as well. You know, the safety of our associates is certainly a paramount concern, and so, it's the safety of the seniors that we serve. So, we are fully prepared to adjust our sales processes accordingly in-light of this pandemic. You know, in fact, we are expecting that more than 50% of our sales activity will probably be virtual for this year's AEP. Similarly, I would think that more of our agent engagement and training activities are going to be held virtually as well. So, you know, much of AEP activity is going to depend on CMS guidance as the future of COVID remains uncertain for all of us and that guidance is changing every day and we're closely monitoring that guidance as well. So, we are fully prepared and proactively investing so that we can make sure we are prepared to support agent engagement and our sales activity through any channel that the member wants to buy being very mindful of the changes that are ahead of us, but feel very prepared to be able to continue to deliver the strong sales performance in this new environment, including the virtual environment, which will be in our AEP as we head into 01/01 of 2021.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nRalph Giacobbe : Thanks, good morning. You know you talked about DCP up and reserves building, but, you know, the expectation that costs essentially come back in the second half and obviously lots of uncertainty out there. You know, unfortunately, you can't really take a wait and see approach to pricing for 2021, so I guess at this point, what can you tell us about your approach to pricing for the commercial book next year and maybe assumption of pent-up demand and perhaps acuity that timing wise may push into 2021? And then, along those lines, how have conversations gone with employers? And do you expect movement or switching next year? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Pete?\nPete Haytaian: Yes, thanks, Ralph. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think, you know a majority of \u2013 we talked about this last quarter, but a majority of our book renews in January, so we certainly do have the luxury of some additional time before we finalize rates. That said, we are obviously closely monitoring the situation. We're considering all factors, many of which you mentioned, from our expectation on deferred utilization to electives to the cost of treatment and the cost of testing, and we're really, you know, using the best information we have before us at this time. I think another important factor; we all know that the HIF will be going away in 2021, so that is certainly a factor that serves as a buffer. Overall, we're going to remain really balanced, and most importantly, we are not going to be short sighted. We're going to remain disciplined with respect to pricing and we're going to price to our view of normalized forward trend. As it relates to our conversations with commercial clients and growth, it's going really well. Our value proposition is selling through. You know, obviously, as Gail alluded to when she was talking about Ingenio, and other parts of our business, as it relates to growth in the back half of 2020, and as it relates to some decisions for 2021, as you'd expect, there were some deferrals.  So for national accounts, for example, we had some expectations of some pretty big accounts that we thought would come through in 2021 that were deferred to the 2022 cycle, but importantly, you know, as it relates to just our sales cycle currently, and that which we feel good about into 2021, we do feel good about growing groups. I think the most significant factor and unknown right now is the impacts of in-group change, that has been the biggest driver of our membership attrition, and so obviously, there's a lot of factors associated with this and we can't be precise about it. But we do feel good about growing groups going into 2021. And then importantly, believe it or not, even though we're in the last 30 or so days of our selling cycle for national, already having conversations about 2022, and the pipeline for 2022, you know looks very good as well.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Just one last question about the exchanges, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there as far as membership trends now and if there's any data on the, you know, acuity of those [debt members]? And then, how you're thinking about next year? It does seem like more competitors are getting onto the exchanges, any view on preliminary rates and whether pricing looks rational for next year? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, thanks for the question, Kevin. You know, I think as we look at the individual market today and the overall individual exchange, it's been pretty consistent. And as we shared, most of our membership growth has come from the re-verification and we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we've seen some small pickup in individual around the ACA-compliant plans, but overall, we have not seen dramatic increases across the book of business and we think a lot of that is because there's sort of a delay between when people either they're on furloughs or then they go off [employer] coverage and there's a delay in the timing. In terms of our strategy, we've stayed really consistent. We expanded in certain geographies where we felt it made sense. We've stayed in our footprint overall. I think it's too early to plan on acuity because again, the book hasn't really significantly changed very much. We haven't seen significant growth because of unemployment. So, I think those factors are important. As we think about the future, we've been really disciplined in our individual exchange strategy and we feel good about that. We're going to continue it and we'll look to expand in areas where it makes sense where our footprint is strong and where we think that we obviously have a strong Blue advantage given our brand and the network configuration that we have. So overall, you know, I think we'll look for modest expansion. Our strategy has played very well over the last few years and we'll continue with it. We've got teams focused on that business and deep analytics. So, thanks for the question. Next one please?\nOperator: Next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Your line is open, go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Just want to ask a little bit more about, Gail, your thoughts on commercial market? You know, I heard and appreciate all the comments about, you know, how well the catcher's mitt is performing so far. It definitely is and the fact that your book of business is a bit differentiated, better positioned, but, you know, we still sit here in an environment where national unemployment is up 750 basis points. There are expectations that that moves higher and I don't think any of us would have guessed that, you know, you'd only have, you know, local group enrollment down, you know, 1.5%, you know, sequentially and another large payer, you know, down 1% and change sequentially. So, I know you're contemplating that that, you know, logically will deteriorate further, but I guess, big picture, you know, is this all just federal stimulus dollars supporting these temporary furloughs? Do you see a quarter where there's an inflection point where the stimulus dollar\u2019s fall off and this really accelerate? And could you just give us a little more color on how the last few months have developed? Has the commercial risk enrollment just slowly deteriorated and July was down even a little more than June? Or has there been relative stability in those declines of June and July? \nGail Boudreaux : Yes, well, thanks for the question, Gary. There's a lot in there and I think \u2013 you know let me start with as it relates to the remainder of the year, we do \u2013 and I want to be clear, we do expect further declines, you know, assuming the economy continues to operate at less than full capacity. In terms of the dynamics of very unusual set of circumstances, and it's hard to really predict, so as we think about 2008 and the deep recession that we faced then and, you know, we've obviously done a lot of modeling, and, you know, trying to understand where our unemployment rate is. And at this stage, you know, part of the reason we don't have full year guidance on enrollment is because of that very factor. There are so many things that are puts and takes in it. But as I think more broadly about our business and what's different and \u2013 you know, I'll go back to a couple of key things. One is, the mix of our business is different, that we are much more resilient in terms of the type of groups that we have. Two, I do think that, you know, our focus on affordable product offerings and what we\u2019ve done to really work with our local sales teams to reach out to our brokers to provide solutions, whether it's the premium credits or some of the opportunities to help them make sure that they can find the right products that meet their price point. Our retention is really strong. You asked about sort of, are we seeing, you know, acceleration or changes into July again early, but early signals are really strong. There's \u2013 we're not seeing any real changes at this stage. So, I think that resilience is showing up, but again, you know, people are still under furloughs. We can't predict exactly what's going to happen when they come off. It will depend on the strengthening of the economy and what happens there and what employers decide to do. So again, while we are predicting further declines in the commercial business, I do think, overall that our team has \u2013 I give our team a lot of credit. They've done a really nice job of finding solutions to keep employers with their employees insured under our programs and give them options, and I think, we didn't have that years ago and that's really one of the big differences, a real broad portfolio of offerings. So hopefully that answers your question, but it gives you a little sense that we feel that we have \u2013 you know we've provided solutions to employers and that's been one of the reasons that \u2013 and we also expect retention has stayed very strong and that's been a help. But again, in group attrition it\u2019s the one thing that's very hard to predict through the rest of this year. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo of UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. I'm just curious if you're seeing any changes in the stop loss market for 2021, not sure how employers are approaching, you know, any coverage changes? What the reinsurance market looks like? Whether or not employers are looking for, you know, more or less protection? Just not sure I have a really good grasp on what this means through the renewal cycle.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, thanks for the question. In terms of trends and things that we're seeing, we really haven't seen a whole lot of difference in that marketplace. It's been pretty consistent. You know, we have a dedicated team that works on stop loss and focus on that both across our business and also offering to our, you know, self-funded clients. So at this stage, no, no real significant changes or trends. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yes. Good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the questions. And John, I guess first, I have kind of a clarification, did you say that you guys took the entire $2.5 billion in premium credits and other subsidies during the quarter? And I guess should we effectively \u2013 should we think of seeing, you know, this kind of a contra revenue account from how the revenue was reported? And then, kind of my follow-up question to that is that when you think about the utilization growth expectations you outlined for the back half, I was thinking that you guys were going to spread the $2.5 billion out over the year. If that's not the case, I guess you guys should have been expecting a couple hundred basis points of what I would call net utilization growth as opposed to kind of gross utilization gross trying to net it up \u2013 trying to understand the interplay between the numerator and the denominator, if you can see where I'm going here?\nJohn Gallina: George, thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify anything that maybe could have been stated a little bit more clearly earlier. So, you know, the $2.5 billion is comprised of many different aspects. There's certainly things that we're providing to our customers, certainly things we're providing to members, things we\u2019re providing to providers and support we're writing to the community. And they all are different timing and associated with when they're being incurred, not all of which will hit the income statement as some of them are various grants and loans to providers in terms of providing liquidity and value to the system. My comment earlier was related specifically to the premium credits in the commercial marketplace that entirety of the premium credits were recorded in the second quarter. However, part of the $2.5 billion also encompasses paying for all of the waivers and deductibles and various other out-of-pocket costs that would have been incurred associated with COVID testing and COVID treatment, and obviously, that will be incurred throughout the rest of 2020. Obviously, anyone that has COVID diagnoses for the last six months of the year, there's an incremental cost to us associated with that that is in the $2.5 billion. And then, also we're providing, for example, a $10 PPE credit to every dental provider for every dental visit that occurs for the next few months. So obviously, that will be recorded in the third quarter as well when that's incurred. So, you know, the \u2013 you know a lot of the things that we've done for the community, including the $50 million foundation funding associated with the social issues, that was all recorded in the second quarter. So a lot of moving parts there, but there is a significant amount that's going to be incurred in the latter half of the year. It's just that the premium credits on commercial were all recorded in the second quarter. And hopefully that clarifies your question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Great, great. Thanks for the question. Just two quick clarifications at this point. One back on Ingenio, you know, I know the scripts that you guys noted into your quarter were down, you know, pretty meaningfully. I think people will understand the dynamic there, but, you know, revenue in Ingenio was actually up sequentially. So just want to make sure I understand the dynamic at play there and how we should think about that for the balance of the year. And then, I guess just in a similar vein, you know, net investment income took a decent step down the quarter, just was curious if there was anything one-time in nature there? Thanks so much.\nJohn Gallina: Yes, thank you for the question. And yes, there are some one-time issues going on. Related to IngenioRx and I had made comments earlier about the profitability and just how well it's performing, I just want to make sure that everyone has some context to this question and the answer that within the PBM industry, that PBMs are able to recognize as product revenue, as well as cost of goods sold, the cost of drugs that are incurred by non-risk business, so that would be all of our ASO customers and the script volume that those customers are incurring we are grossing up our income statement in accordance with appropriate PBM accounting for the cost of goods sold and the product revenue. And, you know, one of our overall strategies on our 5-to-1 to 3-to-1 is to increase the penetration rate of ASO for how many of them utilize PBM services. And yes, we certainly expect to see continued growth in product revenue as a result of increasing penetration and \u2013 or even in these uncertain times. So, you know, that's really a key factor, a key element of that line item. Not much \u2013 no income statement effect in terms of bottom line as those items offset each other, but we should continue to see growth in revenue. Associated with investment income, you know, very clearly there's some one-time issues that have occurred in the marketplace, but first of all, I just want to make sure everybody's clear that about 90% of our portfolio is invested in high-quality fixed maturities. And, you know, back in March and April, you know, we made the decision as part of trying to enhance our liquidity position to not reinvest our positive cash flow and to build that up so that we could have access to the liquidity immediately. And so that actually put a drag on the investment income we would have earned otherwise. And then, the Fed, you know, dropped rates a couple times early in the year, 150 basis points in total. And so, obviously, that impacted the new money rate associated with investments. But the most significant difference is really the third one and that's the fact that we're also invested in alternative investments. You know, it's a nice diversified strategy that includes investments in private equity, core real estate, our diversified credit and in energy. And any changes in market value in that on mark-to-market [indiscernible] through the income statement immediately, and the alternatives did fairly well versus the broader markets, but, you know, energy was the worst performer. And what you're seeing on the income statement in terms of net investment income is the mark-to-market impact of the alternative investments changing our second quarter trajectory. I think you should expect that for the rest of the year that our investment income will exceed a couple hundred million dollars per quarter more in line with historical results, but thanks for the opportunity to clarify that.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Lance Wilkes of Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Medicaid pricing outlook as you're looking out into 2021 or kind of the rates involvement there. And if you could tell us a little bit about discussions you've had to date with states and maybe just help us to, kind of scale understand the magnitude of rate cut proposals at a state level and maybe the process there? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Sure. So, when you think about our Medicare pricing outlook for 2021\u2026\nLance Wilkes: Medicaid please.\nFelicia Norwood: Oh, Medicaid. Oh, you know, Lance, we are certainly in the middle of our rate discussions with our state. About 50% of our states have rate discussions for January. So, half of our state is for January state. In-light of everything that's going on right now, you can imagine there's quite a lot of fluidity in the conversations we're having with our state partners. Now, when you take a look at where we are, the bottom line and foundationally rates are always require to be actually sound. And as you think about our portfolio, which is 24 states across the country, we are engaged in ongoing discussions with many of our state partners. Many of those partners, Lance have asked us to provide regular updates with respect to what's going on a month-to-month basis, and some of those states have essentially said they want to continue to see what's going on with respect to our populations as we head between now and the end of the year. So, we will continue to engage in dialogue, which really is almost on a weekly basis with our state partners around what's going on with respect to performance. And we certainly would expect that utilization will pick up in the back half of the year. When it's all said and done, this is a long game. And certainly performance in any one quarter won't reflect what we expect to see in our population over the course of the year. And our state partners right now [as we are], are very focused on what's going on with respect to access to care with our members, and trying to make sure that members are taken care of during this time with respect to all kinds of needs, but particularly behavior health. So, as we continue these discussions between now and the back half of the year, we are engaged in our ongoing processes with our state partners. We are regularly exchanging information from our perspective with respect to performance, what we are seeing with respect to those new 566,000 members that I reference, what the performance and acuity of that membership looks like, and what expectations should be between now and the back half of the year. So, this is going to be an iterative process with our state partners and as we continue to learn more about the virus and the impact on our business, we will make updates with our state partners and they will do likewise with us. So, thank you very much.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matthew Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk about what as you, you know, had said that I think the healthcare spending you're seeing was at about 90% of normal during the month of June. Can you give us a sense, I imagine Medicare is lower as a lower percentage offset by commercial and Medicaid, but you know, within that, is it more commercial, more Medicaid, just any additional detail that would be really interesting?\nJohn Gallina: Yeah, thanks, Matt, for the question. And just to reiterate a comment that I made a little earlier is that the most significant impact of deferral of procedures occurred in the commercial marketplace, and then Medicaid was in the middle and then Medicare had much, much less impact on the deferral. And we, as we said that there is another spike in COVID here in July, we're actually monitoring it very closely, trying to understand what the impact of the deferrals are and how the pent-up demand is impacting as well. And so, you know, but like we've seen an increase in procedures such as, joint replacement surgeries, and other procedures, some things can only be delayed so long until the pain or the severity is so significant that the person is going to go in and actually get the procedure. So, a lot of moving parts there, but, you know commercial has the most significant impact and Medicare actually has minimal impact here as we head into the third quarter.\nMatthew Borsch: Okay, thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and squeezing me in. I was wondering if the COVID crisis has brought to light any cost structure changes that might be of a more permanent nature. So, for example, things like real estate in the SG&A line, or perhaps co-pay structures or payment of virtual visits at parody, things like that in the medical cost structure, just looking for things that endure beyond the crisis?\nJohn Gallina: You know, Dave, those are great questions. And certainly, it's probably premature to declare specifically what things are going to look like, but I do agree with you that we are looking very closely at our real estate footprint and the virtual environment that our associates are in, and just how proud we are of our associates that we've been able to maintain productive and efficient workforce during this timeframe and really take a closer look at that for the future. Telehealth clearly is here to stay. And it's really helping us find the right setting. And it's really all about getting the right care, at the right time, in the right place for our members, and how we're utilizing the various virtual engagements in the digital type capabilities that we've been \u2013 we've been creating as well. It's very clear that those are here to stay. And so it's going to be a lot about optimizing those things. You know, ER volume is down. I think we've seen about 50% of commercial ER utilization is actually non-emergent, and so that can actually be a positive to the healthcare trends in the future as we really get that right. And find the sweet spot of that. So, great questions and things that we're talking about on a daily basis here.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. And just to reiterate what John said, we're obviously looking at our entire enterprise, and we always take a look at our admin expenses and where we are, but importantly, digital health is here to stay, and we've seen a real acceleration in that scenario. We put quite a bit of investment and so we feel very well-positioned. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from, excuse me, Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Willoughby: Hi, yes. Two questions for you. Thanks for taking my call. You know, first, John I was just wondering if you could follow-up briefly on Ingenio, you made a comment about the additional $100 million of flow through to shareholders, just wanted to confirm that that approximately means roughly $500 million of earnings upside from Ingenio or cost savings from Ingenio relative to your initial expectations.\nJohn Gallina: I'm not \u2013 so, I didn't quite follow the 500. Just let me let me clarify the Ingenio numbers. You know, back 90 days ago when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we talked about the $4 billion savings on the contract and that at least 20% of that would [in order to shareholders]. So that would be your 800 million. We've raised that today to approximately 900 million. In addition, the Ingenio reporting segment includes business that has been Anthem business historically that has been recorded in the commercial business division. And that's where we had the PBM services for our ASO customers that actually we had contracted with historically to provide PBM services. And that $75 million to $100 million per quarter of op gain that had previously been in the commercial segment that starting in 2020, starting in January of 2020 is from reclassified, those members have been reclassified and are now reflected in the IngenioRx segment. And so those two things are the vast, vast majority of the earnings in the Ingenio segment. And the other things in the [IngenioRx] segment would include third party business, we're the PBM for another company or other business that we have with third parties, but that is a very small and the overall profitability of the segment. Hopefully that clarifies your question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Your line is open.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah, thanks. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up from earlier on talking about the membership and I think as I've mentioned that about the attrition and commercial being less than expected because of sort of the enhanced benefits, which I think you were referring to, but \u2013 that you expected to pick up in the back half of the year. You know, related to that, are you seeing this membership shifting around into areas like the exchanges or an uptick in COBRA? And what would you expect to see if enhanced benefits are extended? Because it seems like your guides assumes that they end here in July. So, and if those aren't extended, do you see them \u2013 then the membership, you know, shifting more into Medicaid? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah, thanks for the question. There's a lot in there. And you know, just given that we're not giving guidance, part of this is there's so many moving parts, but I'll give you a little bit of color. First on COBRA, we really haven't seen any increase in COBRA. It's very, very low, just given the cost structure of Cobra. So, that hasn't changed at all very different from 2018 or 2008 rather. In terms of your other questions, as I mentioned earlier on a response, the exchanges have not seen a significant impact because of unemployment. So it's been sort of the normal growth pattern that we expected and the exchanges and again, we do think there's just some delays. I really can't comment on, you know, furloughing and what employers are going to do relative to unemployment. Clearly, we've made some commentary that we do think that we'll see attrition increases in group increases over the course of the back half of the year. You know, our expectation is that the unemployment rate improves at the end of the year to roughly, you know, a little over 10%, but that makes it challenging to reasonably project the impact of enrollment at this time. But again, you know, I think really what we're seeing in our current results is the result of our existing business segments executing strategies to keep retention high and give employers options to keep people enrolled. So our group retention numbers are high and we're seeing the attrition is inside of groups and those are based on the employment decisions that are occurring. Thanks for the question.  Next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Frank Morgan of RBC Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nFrank Morgan: Yes, a real quick one. I was curious if you could give an update on the grace periods granted in your commercial segment? I think last quarter, you mentioned it was about between [one half to 1%] in the quarter and maybe ended at around 3%. Any updates on the second quarter or maybe how you're doing in June or July? Thanks,\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. I\u2019ll have Pete answer.\nPete Haytaian: Yeah, thanks for the question, Frank. We obviously, you know, recognize these are unprecedented times and ever since COVID started, we've been focused on partnering with our employer and broker partners to really see this through together. And as you alluded to, we instituted a variety of approaches, including grace periods, but also other payment options. All that said, we're very encouraged with where we are with collections. You mentioned that last call, I mentioned that about 1% of premium as representative of groups that typically utilize grace periods. And at that time, our expectation was, with COVID, we could see that, you know, creep to 3%, but our collection rates actually local a lot more like a normalized environment pre-COVID. And in fact, in the last couple of months, we've seen an improvement. When you look at, for example, the small group segment, which is indicative of a lot, it's really, really held up well with premium payments, really following normal patterns. And then with the overall book \u2013 overall makeup of our book being skewed to essential services, we're also seeing, you know good payment patterns there. So, overall, that's been a real positive development.\nGail Boudreaux: Great, thank you. I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Mike Newshel of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMike Newshel: Thanks. Since the Medicaid enrollment growth you're seeing is being driven primarily by the suspended re-verification, I was just wondering if you could confirm whether that would be a margin tailwind, as well since those enrollees would otherwise turn, you know, tend to be relatively healthier. So, essentially the reversal of the margin pressure, when re-verification push enrollment down and when re-verification does resume at some point, you know would you expect to see that margin pressure again or now that there's some data and a track record, is there potential to work with states to mitigate the effect and rates faster the next time? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yeah, no, thank you for the question. And, you know, one of the things that we've always said about the Medicaid business is that it is typically that the acuity and the risks that we have in a particular quarter, and the revenue that's recognized associated with that risk almost never match. Just having out of period adjustments and true-ups and retroactive rate increases and decreases etcetera is just a way of business within Medicaid, especially when you have such a large and vast portfolio of states which we have. But your point is very well made, that the overall acuity \u2013 you would perceive the overall acuity of those who members to be a little bit better because when we lost them a year ago, it did change the remaining acuity. So clearly, we will continue to work with the states and ensure that we have actual or early sound rates. We are in a risk corridor position with the majority of our rates, or majority of our states, I'm sorry, that will, you know, help provide downside risk protection, as well as, you know, limit the upside associated with that. It really does balance it very well for both sides of the equation, but you know, your point is well made that you know, that it should change the acuity a bit, but I really do think that the risk corridors that we've been advocating for quite some time, really help address the issue pretty significantly. So, appreciate the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. And I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for the call today. As we shared, Anthem has shown resiliency and agility in times of great change in our industry. Despite these societal headwinds, I remain confident in our dedicated associates, our strong Anthem brand, and our ability to serve as the trusted healthcare partner of choice for those who need us now more than ever. As we move forward in 2020, we\u2019ll continue to lend our voice and our leadership to shaping a safer, more affordable, and more effective healthcare experience for all we serve.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Pete Haytaian",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks Josh, for the question. And as Gail said, the membership in the quarter ended up a lot better than we had originally expected with the broad unemployment. And as you refer to a big, you know cause of that was furloughs in terms of, you know, having deep insights to with respect to the exact amount of folks that are furloughed, I don't have that, you know, information at a precise level. So, I don't want to sort of make an assumption associated with that, but it definitely has been a big factor. The other thing that I had mentioned that's noteworthy is the makeup of our commercial book, which is really disproportionately in less risky segments. So, we have as you know a lot of state and government business accounts, as well as providing services for a lot of folks and essential services. So, we feel really good, you know about that. In terms of up-selling and selling more value into our ASO accounts, we have seen a bit of a slowdown when we talk about on the ASO side, improving our margins and going from 5 to 1 to 3 to 1, and you hear us talk a lot about us up-selling those services. And prior to COVID occurring, we were on a very strong path. I could say with great confidence that we would have likely, you know, been at around the 4 to 1 level. So, slightly ahead of, you know where we wanted to be, but as Gail noted, you know, when you think about things like pharmacy and you think about other, you know, value-added services that we provide, and that we're up-selling there has been a bit of a slow down because of COVID and a hesitation and folks deferring some of those decisions into 2021 and 2022. So, we have seen a little bit of a bump in the road, but as it relates to moving forward, we are very confident as we \u2013 on our path to the 3 to 1 and the value proposition is really selling. And as we are in COVID, we continue to innovate and deploy new programs. For example, you know, when we acquire a new asset like beacon, it creates a lot of additional opportunity for us to sell, for example, behavioral health services. So we feel very good about long-term. Yes, thanks, Ralph. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I think, you know a majority of \u2013 we talked about this last quarter, but a majority of our book renews in January, so we certainly do have the luxury of some additional time before we finalize rates. That said, we are obviously closely monitoring the situation. We're considering all factors, many of which you mentioned, from our expectation on deferred utilization to electives to the cost of treatment and the cost of testing, and we're really, you know, using the best information we have before us at this time. I think another important factor; we all know that the HIF will be going away in 2021, so that is certainly a factor that serves as a buffer. Overall, we're going to remain really balanced, and most importantly, we are not going to be short sighted. We're going to remain disciplined with respect to pricing and we're going to price to our view of normalized forward trend. As it relates to our conversations with commercial clients and growth, it's going really well. Our value proposition is selling through. You know, obviously, as Gail alluded to when she was talking about Ingenio, and other parts of our business, as it relates to growth in the back half of 2020, and as it relates to some decisions for 2021, as you'd expect, there were some deferrals.  So for national accounts, for example, we had some expectations of some pretty big accounts that we thought would come through in 2021 that were deferred to the 2022 cycle, but importantly, you know, as it relates to just our sales cycle currently, and that which we feel good about into 2021, we do feel good about growing groups. I think the most significant factor and unknown right now is the impacts of in-group change, that has been the biggest driver of our membership attrition, and so obviously, there's a lot of factors associated with this and we can't be precise about it. But we do feel good about growing groups going into 2021. And then importantly, believe it or not, even though we're in the last 30 or so days of our selling cycle for national, already having conversations about 2022, and the pipeline for 2022, you know looks very good as well. Yeah, thanks for the question, Frank. We obviously, you know, recognize these are unprecedented times and ever since COVID started, we've been focused on partnering with our employer and broker partners to really see this through together. And as you alluded to, we instituted a variety of approaches, including grace periods, but also other payment options. All that said, we're very encouraged with where we are with collections. You mentioned that last call, I mentioned that about 1% of premium as representative of groups that typically utilize grace periods. And at that time, our expectation was, with COVID, we could see that, you know, creep to 3%, but our collection rates actually local a lot more like a normalized environment pre-COVID.

When you look at, for example, the small group segment, which is indicative of a lot, it's really, really held up well with premium payments, really following normal patterns. And then with the overall book \u2013 overall makeup of our book being skewed to essential services, we're also seeing, you know good payment patterns there. So, overall, that's been a real positive development."

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us for Anthem's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Since our last earnings review, our business has continued to evolve and respond to the ongoing health crisis and social justice issues facing society. The impacts of these events are profound for associates, local communities, and all those we serve. Over the past several months, Anthem has continued to take bold steps to directly support those who need our help.  Last quarter, we took action to commit $2.5 billion in financial assistance, to ease the burden of COVID-19 among our members, employer, customers, air providers and non-profit partners. The needs are ongoing, and I'm proud of the way Anthem has responded quickly to provide needed support. We remain committed to creating a more affordable healthcare experience for our valued members and customers. To that end, we remove barriers to care by waiving cost sharing for treatment of COVID-19, including coverage for testing, treatment, and in-patient hospital stays. We also waive prior authorizations for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and related covered services. To date, we've paid approximately $500 million associated with COVID-19 related diagnoses. In addition, we provided our associates, individual and employer group customers with a one-month premium credit ranging from 10% to 15% while individuals on our standalone and group dental plans received a 50% credit. We continue to deliver value to our customers by providing them with flexible payment terms, as well as affordable buy down options as they navigate the crisis. Our unwavering commitment to our local communities is an integral part of our strategy and legacy at Anthem. For more than 75 years, we've understood the privilege and responsibility. We have to make positive change in the communities where we live and work. This commitment reflects our mission and all that we stand for. And it was at the heart of our recent $50 million pledge over the next five years to focus directly on health disparities, racial inequities, and the key drivers of health such as food and security, mental health, housing, and economic recovery. We know that food security is one of the most profound needs in the wake of the pandemic. A recent study showed that nearly 40% of households today report moderate to high levels of food insecurity, with children being impacted the most. To combat this trend, we are increasing our support as a leading national partner with Feeding America. Here in our home state of Indiana, we were pleased to recently announce a partnership with Gleaners Food Bank to provide more than 10 million meals as part of our $1 million matching grant to expand access to nutritious food. Our associates are doing their part to give back as well and it's inspiring. They're deeply committed to fulfilling our purpose, and have donated more than 27,000 hours of virtual volunteering with online mentoring, teaching, community outreach, along with donating much needed resources to local organizations, and today, our social responsibility efforts take a bold new step, as I am pleased to announce we are signing on to the UN Global Compact.  Now, more than ever, we recognize the important societal role we play to help shape a stronger, more inclusive, and more sustainable world. As we reflect on our performance, the quarter clearly demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and trust in the Anthem brand. Despite declines in our commercial business, losses were less than expected, particularly in our local group, risk-based business where in-group attrition was partially offset by new sales exceeding lapses. Medical enrollment increased by 1.6 million lives or nearly 4%, compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Putting that growth in perspective, Medicaid enrollment grew sequentially by nearly 10 times the decline in our risk-based employer group enrollment. The pandemic has impacted our Medicaid and Medicare populations particularly hard, and we have moved quickly to deliver true whole person care. Our customer care associates have been doing one-on-one outreach to our vulnerable members, ensuring access to food, safe housing, as well as guiding new members through on-boarding and helping them enroll in support programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. To date, we've reached out to 80% of our high-risk Medicaid and Medicare members, and this work continues. I remain grateful to our care provider partners for their ongoing work on the frontlines of care delivery. As part of our support to those partners, we've simplified policies and procedures, including temporarily suspending prior authorization requirements for patient transfers, oxygen supplies, respiratory devices, and multifunction ventilators, enabling them to focus on delivering exceptional care. In addition, we're extending financial support to targeted primary care physicians who are facing undue pressures during this period, as utilization slowly returns to normal levels. Our compassionate and committed care providers in CareMore, Aspire and HealthSun are beginning to return to direct care for our most vulnerable members. These touch points include the use of remote patient monitoring for a variety of chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure and COPD, along with in-home and online care and support. If we think about innovation, Anthem is helping shape our industry for the digital future. We are pioneering technologies to deliver personalized care designed to improve total health to help consumers manage their health and wellness at every stage of life. Digital first is the cornerstone of the future of healthcare. And our experiences with COVID-19 have only accelerated our efforts in this space. For employer customers and government partners, we recently launched the C19 Navigator and C19 Explorer tools to aggregate real time COVID-19 data to help inform and guide return to workplace decisions and resource planning. And for consumers, our Sydney Care solution is using data and AI to help individuals triage their own symptoms and seek care directly from their phone. To date, we've facilitated more than 475,000 telehealth visits in 82,000 COVID-19 assessments. As one of the first managed care companies to partner with Amazon Alexa, Anthem members can now use our new Anthem Skill, personal voice assistant to check their health plan details, schedule calls with customer representatives and renew prescriptions directly through their Alexa enabled devices. At its recent peak, virtual health visits by our members were up 300% relative to pre-COVID levels. Live health online, our on demand telehealth solution surpassed 1 million visits in early April and demand continues. Demand for telemedicine in the behavioral health space is also increasing with the usage at 56 times pre-COVID levels. Our Beacon behavioral health team has responded to this growing need and pivoted quickly to help transition care providers to a digital interface, enhance online supports and services for consumers and conduct outreach for our most at risk members to address special care needs. Collaborative partnerships continue to be a strategic focus in Anthem. We were pleased to join \u201cThe Fight Is In Us\u201d campaign, a results driven public private partnership focused on the promising use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to help improve outcomes and treatments for those with active infection. We're also pleased to serve as a founding partner of the XPRIZE pandemic alliance, working to help develop scalable tests that are rapid, accurate, and low cost. The alliance is a global coalition leveraging the power of collaboration, competition, and shared innovation to accelerate solutions that can be applied to COVID-19 and future pandemics. Looking ahead, we recognize there is much unknown regarding the magnitude and duration of this pandemic given the recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country. Despite this uncertainty, Anthem is well-positioned to achieve our 2020 EPS guidance and deliver on our longer-term financial goal. And with that, I will now turn the call over to John Gallina to discuss our financial results. John? Thanks for the question, Ricky. Next question please. Thanks for the question, Justin. I'tm going to have Felicia comment, but I think, as you noted, we feel very strongly about the membership gains we saw, and specific to your question, the vast majority were due to the stopping of re-verification versus unemployment and other things that would have occurred during that time. But as we look at our overall membership growth, again, we feel we also gained share during this time as strong brand resonated. But I'll have Felicia maybe give you a little bit more color in terms of the discussions with the states. Felicia? Thanks for the question, Justin. And just sort of reiterating, I think what Felicia said, we feel that it's been very constructive dialogue with the states and you know, it's part of our model, that it's a continuous conversation that we're in with them, but overall from a growth perspective, and where we are from a share we feel quite good about our Medicaid performance. Next question please. Stephen, just a little clarification on the membership comment you said about the offset, I just want to clarify a couple things. One, as we look at our overall commercial enrollment, as we shared in our prepared remarks, we were down 290,000 lives, but as you think about unemployed appointment that was fairly muted and particularly so as our risk based lives. So, that was, we do expect, we think that furloughs have dampened that impact over the course of your day, but we feel are very resilient, quite frankly in our commercial business, and we're really pleased that our sales offset our lapses, actually, in the quarter as we look at our risk group business, so another sign that I think our teams have really put out some affordable products and have been doing a nice job of managing through this. But on overall basis, you know, we've often talked about having this large catcher's mitt of opportunity. I think clarifying what Felicia was saying a little more specifically, as you look at the quarter, and I shared in my remarks, are Medicaid outpaced our risk lives by 10 times, so clearly offset much of that. And also it's quite compelling when you're trading risk lives for fee based lives. So, a lot of our losses came in our self-funded ASO customers and we were able to generate much more in our risk life. So overall, we do expect as unemployment continues to lose more commercial lives. So, I don't want to leave you with the impression that we won't, but overall, we feel we had a very resilient catcher's mitt across our book of business. So thanks for the question. And next question please. In terms of the selling season, A.J., you know, it's been an interesting operating environment given all the change and I think we shared this in the last quarter, things are, I would say at least slightly delayed as customers try to work through their own stability across their business. While I think it's still early, I would say that our pipeline is still quite good. We are seeing some delays and overall decisions to move from 2021 to 2022, but overall, the sales cycle has been pretty active. We've seen, you know an increase year-over-year in that pipeline. We feel that one of our best opportunities is to embed IngenioRx in our own fee-based business and that's been going well. We're also pleased that we'll be adding Blue Cross of Idaho as part of our Medicare base in [1/1/2021]. So that's a nice add as well, as you know, we brought on the commercial business this year as part of the transition. So overall, I think we're probably going to expect some delays in the overall decision making for our largest customers, but we still feel very compelling sales proposition, particularly as we added to our self-funded business this year.  Thanks for the question. Next one please. Next question please. Thanks. Josh. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian to answer. Please, Pete. And Josh the only other thing I'd add is, we've seen really strong retention of our accounts. So, the in-group attrition is obviously driving that, and that gets your question around furloughs versus you know, downsizing, and then the second thing and I'll just reiterate it, and I think the commercial team has really done an incredible job coming out of 2019, but also into this year, that our sales are outpacing labs. So, despite the environment, particularly in our risk-based business, we're continuing to see traction of the new product offerings and the segment focus that we put in under piece leadership. So, I think those are all contributing as well as I think just the makeup of our book is helpful there too. Next question please. Yes. Thanks for the question, Steve. Let me offer a few comments, and I'll ask Felicia, who leads that business to provide more detail. You know, we did, when the pandemic originally hit, we did see a slowdown in sales just because historically it has been face-to-face, but we've actually she recovered very nicely since over the last few months and I think, working with our brokers and others, we've been able to really put in much more direct selling and channels where there isn't as much face-to-face. So we've been working very diligently and as you look at our growth, you know, we've had very strong growth last year over 20%, and this year, quarter-over-quarter up 17% over prior year and 13% year-to-date and expect to continue to see the alternative methodologies we put in place. I'll ask Felicia to comment particularly about how we're ensuring the safety as well as how we're engaging with our Medicare Advantage members in particular. Felicia? Next question please? Pete? Thank you. Next question please. Yes, thanks for the question, Kevin. You know, I think as we look at the individual market today and the overall individual exchange, it's been pretty consistent. And as we shared, most of our membership growth has come from the re-verification and we haven't seen \u2013 we've seen some small pickup in individual around the ACA-compliant plans, but overall, we have not seen dramatic increases across the book of business and we think a lot of that is because there's sort of a delay between when people either they're on furloughs or then they go off [employer] coverage and there's a delay in the timing. In terms of our strategy, we've stayed really consistent. We expanded in certain geographies where we felt it made sense. We've stayed in our footprint overall. I think it's too early to plan on acuity because again, the book hasn't really significantly changed very much. We haven't seen significant growth because of unemployment. So, I think those factors are important. As we think about the future, we've been really disciplined in our individual exchange strategy and we feel good about that. We're going to continue it and we'll look to expand in areas where it makes sense where our footprint is strong and where we think that we obviously have a strong Blue advantage given our brand and the network configuration that we have. So overall, you know, I think we'll look for modest expansion. Our strategy has played very well over the last few years and we'll continue with it. We've got teams focused on that business and deep analytics. So, thanks for the question. Next one please? Yes, well, thanks for the question, Gary. There's a lot in there and I think \u2013 you know let me start with as it relates to the remainder of the year, we do \u2013 and I want to be clear, we do expect further declines, you know, assuming the economy continues to operate at less than full capacity. In terms of the dynamics of very unusual set of circumstances, and it's hard to really predict, so as we think about 2008 and the deep recession that we faced then and, you know, we've obviously done a lot of modeling, and, you know, trying to understand where our unemployment rate is. And at this stage, you know, part of the reason we don't have full year guidance on enrollment is because of that very factor. There are so many things that are puts and takes in it. But as I think more broadly about our business and what's different and \u2013 you know, I'll go back to a couple of key things. One is, the mix of our business is different, that we are much more resilient in terms of the type of groups that we have. Two, I do think that, you know, our focus on affordable product offerings and what we've done to really work with our local sales teams to reach out to our brokers to provide solutions, whether it's the premium credits or some of the opportunities to help them make sure that they can find the right products that meet their price point. Our retention is really strong. You asked about sort of, are we seeing, you know, acceleration or changes into July again early, but early signals are really strong. There's \u2013 we're not seeing any real changes at this stage. So, I think that resilience is showing up, but again, you know, people are still under furloughs. We can't predict exactly what's going to happen when they come off. It will depend on the strengthening of the economy and what happens there and what employers decide to do. So again, while we are predicting further declines in the commercial business, I do think, overall that our team has \u2013 I give our team a lot of credit. They've done a really nice job of finding solutions to keep employers with their employees insured under our programs and give them options, and I think, we didn't have that years ago and that's really one of the big differences, a real broad portfolio of offerings. So hopefully that answers your question, but it gives you a little sense that we feel that we have \u2013 you know we've provided solutions to employers and that's been one of the reasons that \u2013 and we also expect retention has stayed very strong and that's been a help. But again, in group attrition it's the one thing that's very hard to predict through the rest of this year. Next question please. Yes, thanks for the question. In terms of trends and things that we're seeing, we really haven't seen a whole lot of difference in that marketplace. It's been pretty consistent. You know, we have a dedicated team that works on stop loss and focus on that both across our business and also offering to our, you know, self-funded clients. So at this stage, no, no real significant changes or trends. Next question please. Next question please. Next question please. Felicia? Next question please. Thank you. Next question. Yeah. Thanks, Dave. And just to reiterate what John said, we're obviously looking at our entire enterprise, and we always take a look at our admin expenses and where we are, but importantly, digital health is here to stay, and we've seen a real acceleration in that scenario. We put quite a bit of investment and so we feel very well-positioned. Next question please. Next question please. Yeah, thanks for the question. There's a lot in there. And you know, just given that we're not giving guidance, part of this is there's so many moving parts, but I'll give you a little bit of color. First on COBRA, we really haven't seen any increase in COBRA. It's very, very low, just given the cost structure of Cobra. So, that hasn't changed at all very different from 2018 or 2008 rather. In terms of your other questions, as I mentioned earlier on a response, the exchanges have not seen a significant impact because of unemployment. So it's been sort of the normal growth pattern that we expected and the exchanges and again, we do think there's just some delays. I really can't comment on, you know, furloughing and what employers are going to do relative to unemployment. Clearly, we've made some commentary that we do think that we'll see attrition increases in group increases over the course of the back half of the year. You know, our expectation is that the unemployment rate improves at the end of the year to roughly, you know, a little over 10%, but that makes it challenging to reasonably project the impact of enrollment at this time. But again, you know, I think really what we're seeing in our current results is the result of our existing business segments executing strategies to keep retention high and give employers options to keep people enrolled. So our group retention numbers are high and we're seeing the attrition is inside of groups and those are based on the employment decisions that are occurring. Thanks for the question.  Next question please. Sure. I'll have Pete answer. Great, thank you. I think we have time for one last question. Thank you. And I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for the call today. As we shared, Anthem has shown resiliency and agility in times of great change in our industry. Despite these societal headwinds, I remain confident in our dedicated associates, our strong Anthem brand, and our ability to serve as the trusted healthcare partner of choice for those who need us now more than ever. As we move forward in 2020, we'll continue to lend our voice and our leadership to shaping a safer, more affordable, and more effective healthcare experience for all we serve. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Gail. And thank you for the question. Our Medicaid enrollment in the second quarter ended at approximately 8.2 million members. This was up 566,000 compared to the first quarter. And as Gail mentioned, that was primarily due to the temporary suspension of re-verifications. Our early indications for July as well indicates continued growth in the Medicaid program. We feel very good about our brand and we continue to grow share in the Medicaid space. You know, looking ahead, we believe we're well-positioned to be able to navigate whatever happens in this emerging environment. And the expectation is that we will continue to see Medicaid growth during this time. Roughly 13% to 15% of our members reside in states where Medicaid has [been standard] [ph]. So, while it's too early to quantify the potential impact, certainly if the unemployment rate increases, we would expect growth in our government business to certainly continue to offset any membership declines that might happen on the commercial side. In terms of your question with respect to rate, you know, we certainly won't disclose the amount of any of the experience rated refunds or rate actions, but as John mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects a reasonable view of both our known and expected rate actions and the experience rated refunds. You know, rates are required to be actuarially sound and we work with our state partners on a daily basis on developing rates that are going to be appropriate.  You know, the performance across our 24 markets varies even under normal circumstances, but as you know, some states are reopening and other states are seeing a resurgence in COVID cases. Roughly 15 of our states today have risk [quarters] [ph] or [callers] [ph] in place that effectively already limit managed care profitability within certain defined ranges and we are in discussions with other states that are also considering these kind of mechanisms, which really provides some predictability for both the states in our own business and really tries to ensure that risk is really properly balanced. We have a long history with our state partners, and we're going to continue to work through this with them, and make sure we are able to provide access to care to our members. And that really remains our foremost concern during this time. Thank you. Yes, thank you, Gail. And Steve, thank you for the question. As Gail reference, we've seen strong performance in our business. We certainly had to pivot in-light of COVID and we saw a brief slowdown in our sales soon after COVID. But, you know, sales have actually picked up since that time and our early read on July membership indicates that performance is certainly improving as well. You know, the safety of our associates is certainly a paramount concern, and so, it's the safety of the seniors that we serve. So, we are fully prepared to adjust our sales processes accordingly in-light of this pandemic. You know, in fact, we are expecting that more than 50% of our sales activity will probably be virtual for this year's AEP. Similarly, I would think that more of our agent engagement and training activities are going to be held virtually as well. So, you know, much of AEP activity is going to depend on CMS guidance as the future of COVID remains uncertain for all of us and that guidance is changing every day and we're closely monitoring that guidance as well. So, we are fully prepared and proactively investing so that we can make sure we are prepared to support agent engagement and our sales activity through any channel that the member wants to buy being very mindful of the changes that are ahead of us, but feel very prepared to be able to continue to deliver the strong sales performance in this new environment, including the virtual environment, which will be in our AEP as we head into 01/01 of 2021. Sure. So, when you think about our Medicare pricing outlook for 2021... Oh, Medicaid. Oh, you know, Lance, we are certainly in the middle of our rate discussions with our state. About 50% of our states have rate discussions for January. So, half of our state is for January state. In-light of everything that's going on right now, you can imagine there's quite a lot of fluidity in the conversations we're having with our state partners. Now, when you take a look at where we are, the bottom line and foundationally rates are always require to be actually sound. And as you think about our portfolio, which is 24 states across the country, we are engaged in ongoing discussions with many of our state partners. Many of those partners, Lance have asked us to provide regular updates with respect to what's going on a month-to-month basis, and some of those states have essentially said they want to continue to see what's going on with respect to our populations as we head between now and the end of the year. So, we will continue to engage in dialogue, which really is almost on a weekly basis with our state partners around what's going on with respect to performance. And we certainly would expect that utilization will pick up in the back half of the year. When it's all said and done, this is a long game. And certainly performance in any one quarter won't reflect what we expect to see in our population over the course of the year. And our state partners right now [as we are], are very focused on what's going on with respect to access to care with our members, and trying to make sure that members are taken care of during this time with respect to all kinds of needs, but particularly behavior health. So, as we continue these discussions between now and the back half of the year, we are engaged in our ongoing processes with our state partners. We are regularly exchanging information from our perspective with respect to performance, what we are seeing with respect to those new 566,000 members that I reference, what the performance and acuity of that membership looks like, and what expectations should be between now and the back half of the year. So, this is going to be an iterative process with our state partners and as we continue to learn more about the virus and the impact on our business, we will make updates with our state partners and they will do likewise with us. So, thank you very much."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning. Since the inception of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have worked diligently to serve as a trusted partner for our members and care providers. We proactively committed $2.5 billion in financial support, including extended cost share waivers, premium credits, provided grants, and community support. And this is all while rolling out new and innovative solutions to maximize the health and well-being of our members. While much remains uncertain, we're guided by our values and are firmly committed to rectifying further imbalances for the benefit of our consumers. COVID-19 significantly impacted the normal seasonality inherent in our business as a result of the broad based deferral of healthcare utilization in the second quarter. We achieved adjusted earnings per share of $9.20 in the second quarter, bringing year to date adjusted earnings per share to $15.68. The seasonality of our earnings will differ from our historic patterns. And as we have previously announced, we expect to earn approximately 70% of our annual total in the first six months of the year. Relative to our baseline financial expectations, aggregate utilization was 40% below expectations in April and 20% in May, as people nationwide adhered to shelter in place orders. Our June experience, while still early, suggests a utilization recovery to roughly 90% of baseline. Looking ahead, our guidance assumes the recent recovery in utilization persists and second half utilization comes in slightly ahead of our pre-COVID-19 baseline expectations. All in, we expect this dynamic to increase our second half medical loss ratio by a couple hundred basis points relative to what normal seasonality would have suggested. Medical membership totaled 42.5 million members at the end of the second quarter, reflecting an increase of 1.6 million members, representing nearly 4% growth over the prior year quarter. Even more impressive is that we grew during the second quarter, organically adding 309,000 net new members during these uncertain times. Government business enrollment grew by nearly 600,000 lives in the quarter, more than double the decline in commercial enrollment. Attrition in our commercial business has been less than expected today. However, we believe attrition is likely to accelerate when federal assistance expires. Nonetheless, we expect to mitigate declines in commercial enrollment through growth in our Medicaid and individual ACA businesses. We believe we have the most balanced and resilient membership mix in the sector. In periods of strong economic success, such as the company enjoyed in 2019, we grew our membership. In 2020, during more economically challenging times, we again have been able to grow our membership. Our strategy and business mix allows us to perform well in both positive and negative economic conditions. Overall, we're pleased with how our membership is trending. Results through the second quarter reflect our deliberate efforts to build a more diversified Anthem over the last decade, maintaining our strong commercial franchise, while establishing an industry leading Medicaid platform in a rapidly growing Medicare business. Operating revenue was $29.2 billion in the quarter, growth of nearly 16% over the prior year, and 14% on a HIF-adjusted basis. Growth and operating revenue was driven by the launch of IngenioRx and the related increase in product revenue, membership gains in Medicaid and Medicare, as well as the return of the health insurer fee in 2020. Days and claims payable was 46 days, an increase of 4.1 days from the first quarter, and a 6.9 day increase from the second quarter of 2019. Given the uncertainty, we have taken a conservative posture related to our claims reserves. We expect [DCP] to decline to levels more in-line with historical norms as utilization rebounds in the second half of the year. Operating cash flow was very strong at 2.4 times net income. Cash flow in the quarter benefited from several timing related items, including the delay of certain federal and payroll tax payments in accordance with the CARES Act. In the third quarter, we'll be making three federal tax payments and the $1.6 billion health insurer fee payment.  As a reminder, we took a number of immediate actions in the first quarter to enhance our financial flexibility. We ended the second quarter with approximately $4.1 billion of cash and investments at the parent company. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 39.5%, a decrease of 220 basis points, compared to the 41.7% in the first quarter reflecting our enhanced liquidity position. With liquidity concerns not as prevalent as they were earlier in the year, we have resumed our share repurchase program and continue to expect to repurchase greater than $1.5 billion of shares for the year. To conclude, our performance in the quarter clearly demonstrates that the value of our diversified model is real. As we look ahead, we expect additional commercial enrollment attrition and strong growth in our Medicaid business. Thus far, COVID-19 is not significantly impacting our individual Medicare Advantage growth, which continues to enjoy a mid-double digit growth trajectory.  Although much remains uncertain about the impact and ramifications of the pandemic, our rigorous scenario analyses continue to support our original full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than $22.30. While we have reconfirmed our earnings per share guidance, we continue to withhold guidance on all other metrics. And with that, we will now open it up for questions. Operator? Thank you, Ricky. Appreciate the question. You know, and it's certainly an understatement to say that there's a lot of uncertainty associated with the situation, but you know, we still have a lot of pent-up demand from the second quarter, and you know, we have extended payment of covering co-pays and deductibles for COVID-19 treatment. And in addition, we're providing reimbursement for PPE for dental providers, as well as other benefits we're providing to the provider community. And while an increase in the COVID and the recent spike we have certainly may cause more deferred procedures, right now, we're not expecting a full shutdown of the system similar to what we experienced in April. And so given all the variables, we still do believe that a reasonable estimate will be that our second half medical loss ratio will be about 200 basis points higher in the last part of the year versus what would be expected under normal circumstances. And I guess the only other comment is to note that we did provide the $2.5 billion of value to the system as a result of what's going on. And if non-emergent utilization drops significantly again, you know, we'll certainly take appropriate actions to help address whatever imbalance exist associated with that. So, appreciate the question, but we really do think that the $22.30 EPS guidance is really the best guess right now. Yeah, thank you for the question, Steve. First of all, in the segment reporting and in the benefit of the deferred utilization, it would be \u2013 the deferred utilization actually was a little bit more significant in the commercial market than it was in Medicaid, and then it was the least amount in Medicare in terms of the impact of the non-emergent procedures and the decreased cost structure. However, in the commercial segment, we provided the premium credits to the membership to all of our customers, you know, 10% to 15% on the local business and up to 50% on the specialty business, and the entirety of that was recorded in the second quarter for that entire premium credit. And so that's what is probably the reconciling item in your analysis when you're looking at the quarter-over-quarter is that the premium credits are in the commercial market. And then the commercial market also has the premium cost share waivers for COVID testing and treatment that are part of the commercial results. Associated with the ongoing business and the profitability, we certainly have target margins on all of our businesses. And in the commercial marketplace, you know, the target margins on a fully insured business could easily be 5%, even high single digits, and that could easily work out based on average premium, the $25 to $30 PMPM operating game. However, on the ASO side, the fee revenue is obviously much, much less and a target profit on the fee side could be just $5 PMPM. And then you look over at the Medicaid, well Medicaid you have TANF and you have the higher acuity. There's a lot of variations there, but you know, even at a 2% to 4% op margin, which is our stated op margin for Medicaid, if you utilize the midpoint being 3%, based on the various premium volumes, you have maybe a $12 to an $18 target margin on a PMPM basis. So, as you can see when we lose a commercial member, depending on that if it's fully insured or ASO and it goes over to government, it could actually balance out quite nicely. That's one of the reasons that we continue to talk about how diversified our business mix is and how resilient our membership is, is because the profit margins on the various lines of business really help offset each other when there's a shift between the various areas. Thank you for that question. Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the question. You know, IngenioRx is actually doing quite well and has really done a nice job of meeting our expectations. As you know, we really are in the Ingenio swing of things a full-year earlier than we had expected to, you know based on the original timeline of the ESI contract and being able to get out of that a year ahead. And so 2020 is actually a run rate year, as opposed to an implementation year. And, you know, in terms of the profitability itself, we made about 350 million in first quarter, 304 million here this quarter. And, you know, there's really a few key things going into that. You know the $4 billion in savings that we got from the better contract with CVS, and we've always talked about returning 20% of that to the shareholders, and \u2013 which would be $800 million. Well as we've gone through the first half of the year, and really tried to optimize and maximize the situation, and we believe that we're going to actually return closer to 900 million of that value throughout the course of 2020, and be part of our run rate on a go forward basis. Also Ingenio includes the shift of 75 million to 100 million of operating gain related to existing self-funded pharmacy customers that was previously recorded in the commercial segment, and is now being recorded in the Ingenio segment. And so that's all part of the situation. And then, you know, certainly any revenues or profits from third party business are included in Ingenio as well as that's helping with the overall profitability of the segment. And you know, the first quarter was benefited by the refill too soon relaxation of that edit. And we had an impact there that helped the first quarter to be, maybe higher than a run rate type basis, but you know, we really do believe that the second quarter is a good indication of what the run rate could be, maybe even a little bit better because as scripts, while maintenance scripts work consistent in the second quarter versus historical patterns, new scripts were down 10% to 15% in April. And so, actually the second quarter is probably the low end of a sustainable level for engineer for the future. Thank you for the question. Thank you, Sara. Great question on days and claims payable, and as we said that, days and claims payable is up 4.1 days, sequentially as well as 6.9 days year-over-year. And, you know, the days and claims payable is a function of many things and at time some of those changes can impact DCP without impacting the income statement, and we certainly have part of that going on with the way the math works. But we have seen an elongation of the amount of time it is has taken providers from the point of service to actually submitting the claims to us. So, you know, the cycle time of date of service to claim submission has gone up a couple days across our entire book of business during this pandemic, and you know, a lot of reasons for that, but really that would impact the days in claims calculation, all else being equal. Then also, given the fact that that occurred, I mentioned the conservatism in the prepared comments. We have then further made the completion factors a bit slower, given the uncertainty associated with the billing patterns that we wanted to ensure that we were totally covered. And, and so that would have caused our medical loss ratio to be a bit higher and our DCP to be a bit higher, and if it turns out that we need that we are fully covered. And if it turns out that there's a bit of conservatism, then that would be great. And we'll have some releases later in the year in the next year when we have more transparency into the situation. So, all those things taken, you know, then we also were able to have very, very solid cash flow as a percent of earnings as a result. So, I think they all point to very high quality of earnings. Thank you for the question. George, thank you for the question. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify anything that maybe could have been stated a little bit more clearly earlier. So, you know, the $2.5 billion is comprised of many different aspects. There's certainly things that we're providing to our customers, certainly things we're providing to members, things we're providing to providers and support we're writing to the community. And they all are different timing and associated with when they're being incurred, not all of which will hit the income statement as some of them are various grants and loans to providers in terms of providing liquidity and value to the system. My comment earlier was related specifically to the premium credits in the commercial marketplace that entirety of the premium credits were recorded in the second quarter. However, part of the $2.5 billion also encompasses paying for all of the waivers and deductibles and various other out-of-pocket costs that would have been incurred associated with COVID testing and COVID treatment, and obviously, that will be incurred throughout the rest of 2020. Obviously, anyone that has COVID diagnoses for the last six months of the year, there's an incremental cost to us associated with that that is in the $2.5 billion. And then, also we're providing, for example, a $10 PPE credit to every dental provider for every dental visit that occurs for the next few months. So obviously, that will be recorded in the third quarter as well when that's incurred. So, you know, the \u2013 you know a lot of the things that we've done for the community, including the $50 million foundation funding associated with the social issues, that was all recorded in the second quarter. So a lot of moving parts there, but there is a significant amount that's going to be incurred in the latter half of the year. It's just that the premium credits on commercial were all recorded in the second quarter. And hopefully that clarifies your question. Yes, thank you for the question. And yes, there are some one-time issues going on. Related to IngenioRx and I had made comments earlier about the profitability and just how well it's performing, I just want to make sure that everyone has some context to this question and the answer that within the PBM industry, that PBMs are able to recognize as product revenue, as well as cost of goods sold, the cost of drugs that are incurred by non-risk business, so that would be all of our ASO customers and the script volume that those customers are incurring we are grossing up our income statement in accordance with appropriate PBM accounting for the cost of goods sold and the product revenue. And, you know, one of our overall strategies on our 5-to-1 to 3-to-1 is to increase the penetration rate of ASO for how many of them utilize PBM services. And yes, we certainly expect to see continued growth in product revenue as a result of increasing penetration and \u2013 or even in these uncertain times. So, you know, that's really a key factor, a key element of that line item. Not much \u2013 no income statement effect in terms of bottom line as those items offset each other, but we should continue to see growth in revenue. Associated with investment income, you know, very clearly there's some one-time issues that have occurred in the marketplace, but first of all, I just want to make sure everybody's clear that about 90% of our portfolio is invested in high-quality fixed maturities. And, you know, back in March and April, you know, we made the decision as part of trying to enhance our liquidity position to not reinvest our positive cash flow and to build that up so that we could have access to the liquidity immediately. And so that actually put a drag on the investment income we would have earned otherwise. And then, the Fed, you know, dropped rates a couple times early in the year, 150 basis points in total. And so, obviously, that impacted the new money rate associated with investments. But the most significant difference is really the third one and that's the fact that we're also invested in alternative investments. You know, it's a nice diversified strategy that includes investments in private equity, core real estate, our diversified credit and in energy. And any changes in market value in that on mark-to-market [indiscernible] through the income statement immediately, and the alternatives did fairly well versus the broader markets, but, you know, energy was the worst performer. And what you're seeing on the income statement in terms of net investment income is the mark-to-market impact of the alternative investments changing our second quarter trajectory. I think you should expect that for the rest of the year that our investment income will exceed a couple hundred million dollars per quarter more in line with historical results, but thanks for the opportunity to clarify that. Yeah, thanks, Matt, for the question. And just to reiterate a comment that I made a little earlier is that the most significant impact of deferral of procedures occurred in the commercial marketplace, and then Medicaid was in the middle and then Medicare had much, much less impact on the deferral. And we, as we said that there is another spike in COVID here in July, we're actually monitoring it very closely, trying to understand what the impact of the deferrals are and how the pent-up demand is impacting as well. And so, you know, but like we've seen an increase in procedures such as, joint replacement surgeries, and other procedures, some things can only be delayed so long until the pain or the severity is so significant that the person is going to go in and actually get the procedure. So, a lot of moving parts there, but, you know commercial has the most significant impact and Medicare actually has minimal impact here as we head into the third quarter. Thank you. You know, Dave, those are great questions. And certainly, it's probably premature to declare specifically what things are going to look like, but I do agree with you that we are looking very closely at our real estate footprint and the virtual environment that our associates are in, and just how proud we are of our associates that we've been able to maintain productive and efficient workforce during this timeframe and really take a closer look at that for the future. Telehealth clearly is here to stay. And it's really helping us find the right setting. And it's really all about getting the right care, at the right time, in the right place for our members, and how we're utilizing the various virtual engagements in the digital type capabilities that we've been \u2013 we've been creating as well. It's very clear that those are here to stay. And so it's going to be a lot about optimizing those things. You know, ER volume is down. I think we've seen about 50% of commercial ER utilization is actually non-emergent, and so that can actually be a positive to the healthcare trends in the future as we really get that right. And find the sweet spot of that. So, great questions and things that we're talking about on a daily basis here. I'm not \u2013 so, I didn't quite follow the 500. Just let me let me clarify the Ingenio numbers. You know, back 90 days ago when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we talked about the $4 billion savings on the contract and that at least 20% of that would [in order to shareholders]. So that would be your 800 million. We've raised that today to approximately 900 million. In addition, the Ingenio reporting segment includes business that has been Anthem business historically that has been recorded in the commercial business division. And that's where we had the PBM services for our ASO customers that actually we had contracted with historically to provide PBM services. And that $75 million to $100 million per quarter of op gain that had previously been in the commercial segment that starting in 2020, starting in January of 2020 is from reclassified, those members have been reclassified and are now reflected in the IngenioRx segment. And so those two things are the vast, vast majority of the earnings in the Ingenio segment. And the other things in the [IngenioRx] segment would include third party business, we're the PBM for another company or other business that we have with third parties, but that is a very small and the overall profitability of the segment. Hopefully that clarifies your question. Yeah, no, thank you for the question. And, you know, one of the things that we've always said about the Medicaid business is that it is typically that the acuity and the risks that we have in a particular quarter, and the revenue that's recognized associated with that risk almost never match. Just having out of period adjustments and true-ups and retroactive rate increases and decreases etcetera is just a way of business within Medicaid, especially when you have such a large and vast portfolio of states which we have. But your point is very well made, that the overall acuity \u2013 you would perceive the overall acuity of those who members to be a little bit better because when we lost them a year ago, it did change the remaining acuity. So clearly, we will continue to work with the states and ensure that we have actual or early sound rates. We are in a risk corridor position with the majority of our rates, or majority of our states, I'm sorry, that will, you know, help provide downside risk protection, as well as, you know, limit the upside associated with that. It really does balance it very well for both sides of the equation, but you know, your point is well made that you know, that it should change the acuity a bit, but I really do think that the risk corridors that we've been advocating for quite some time, really help address the issue pretty significantly. So, appreciate the question."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please, go ahead.\nChris Rigg: Good morning and welcome to Anthem's first quarter 2020 earnings call. This is Chris Rigg, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of our Commercial & Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website at antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Across the globe and right here at home we're facing a critical humanitarian crisis. All of us are impacted and our hearts go out to those struggling. I will focus my comments this morning on the impact of the COVID-19 global health crisis on our business along with the actions we've taken to provide support and relief. I will direct you to the earnings released for the financial results for the first quarter. Let me begin by saying how incredibly grateful I am to the men and women including many of Anthem's own clinical associates fighting in the frontlines of this healthcare crisis from small rural communities to the heart of New York City. I am also incredibly proud of the more than 77,000 Anthem associates who have been providing compassionate and tireless support for our customers, members, care providers and communities each day as we battle this pandemic together to ensure the safety and health of our associates and support the nationwide efforts to contain the virus. In March, we began transitioning our employees away from offices and now have nearly 99% working safely at home. In recognition of these unprecedented times, we are offering our associates up to 80 hours of additional paid leave providing online workouts, expanding mental health support and have increased our Anthem Cares Emergency Relief Fund to help associates manage through this crisis. Anthem has long served and met the unique needs of our local communities. Our commitment to improving lives and communities is core to our mission and we have approached our response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a local and personal lens. Anthem along with our association of 35 other independent and locally operated Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies have committed nearly $3 billion to ensure that more than a 100 million Americans along with care providers and hospitals have access to the resources and support they need to help improve the health of America. Because of our strong blue brand and deep local roots we were well-positioned to work quickly and seamlessly with local, state and federal officials, local care providers, key customers and community partners from day one of the pandemic. And our associates are at the forefront of our comprehensive efforts. Our Anthem culture and values serve as our foundation for giving back in our local communities. Our deeply committed associates have been giving back in various ways such as online teaching, outreach via phone or mail to those isolated at home, making masks for non-healthcare industry workers, helping to provide personal care supplies and providing meal delivery to those homebound by the crisis across the country with partners like the American Red Cross, Boys & Girls Club, Feeding America and Americares. Anthem is on the forefront of delivering relief and support to those most impacted. We know there is great fear and uncertainty among consumers right now, particularly when it comes to safe and affordable access to care. We've removed barriers to care by waiving caution for treatment of COVID-19 including coverage for testing, treatment and inpatient hospital stays. We've waived prior authorizations for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and related covered services as well as ensured continuity of care by waiving early prescription refill limits on 30-day maintenance medications and encouraging the use of 90-day mail-order benefits if applicable. We've also expanded access to Telehealth & nurselines for both medical and emotional health to meet the growing needs for 24 by 7 information, support and care. For our most vulnerable consumers in Medicare and Medicaid we've also reinforced our long-standing focus on social drivers of health to provide support with food, housing, transportation and more. From outreach to isolated seniors and families to donating meals and other needed personal care items, we are working to ensure our members needs are being met, that they realize they are not alone in this fight against the virus. Our associates working with these populations are demonstrating their endless compassion and care during this time as well. We've seen examples of our team members personally delivering boxes of food and much needed supplies safely to our members and dire need. Their commitment is inspiring but not surprising this is how Anthem shows up every day to serve others. At the core of the crisis there's been tremendous focus on the need for testing and no bigger push for that testing than in the crisis epicenter of New York City. There we've partnered with the coalition of Asian American IPA to provide free mobile testing in the five boroughs across the city. We also established the Anthem Medical Associate Volunteer Program for associates with professional medical training and licensure, the volunteers at hospitals and other clinical settings in a variety of states including New York where the needs are so great. Our clinical associates are demonstrating Anthem's strong values and commitment to service as they stand fearlessly on the frontlines to deliver critical care. As Anthem's care provider partners continue their important work in local markets across the country we have simplified policies designed to help them deliver care to patients more quickly and effectively. Unless otherwise required under specific state and federal mandates, we have suspended prior authorization requirements for patient transfers and use some medical equipment critical to COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, Anthem is covering respiratory services for acute treatment of COVID-19 along with in-network and out-of-network coverage for COVID-19 laboratory testing. The actions we've taken are ensuring that healthcare providers are focused where they need to be with their patients. Partnerships are foundational to our work in Anthem. Today we're partnering with XPRIZE and other industry leaders to form a global pandemic alliance to combat COVID-19 and leverage learning to help prepare for future pandemics. Across the digital landscape, Anthem has been collaborating extensively with various state and federal partners as well as other private sector partners to innovate and help simplify the entire healthcare system experience through the use of technology. Anthem's digital first capabilities are proactively addressing issues with COVID-19 to simplify healthcare for consumers. Our Sydney Care mobile app and the new Corona virus assessment tool are helping people safely and conveniently assess their risk of having COVID-19, locate testing sites as may be needed and connect directly with a doctor via our virtual care solution. To date, we've seen more than 170,000 downloads of the app and a witness to 250% surge in virtual care engagements via text and video. This crisis has made clear the Telehealth and virtual care will continue to be a key component of how and where care is delivered going forward. Our employer partners are certainly feeling the impacts of the crisis. Anthem is working closely with our customers to ensure not only the safety and well-being of their employees but to also provide affordable, flexible payment terms as they work through the financial implications of COVID-19. We recognize this action may add payment risk to our business. We also know it's the right thing to do. The economic impacts of the crisis may also drive an unprecedented shift in consumers from the employer market into our Medicaid and ACA segments. We are quickly reallocating resources as may be needed to meet these potential challenges. In the small group market a segment especially vulnerable to disruption, we are proactively identifying groups at risk and providing more affordable product offerings. We're helping displace members find coverage in the individual marketplace or in Medicaid. Anthem entered 2020 in a position of strength, ready to achieve our financial objectives and serve as a trusted partner in health. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations and while we know COVID-19 is likely to produce unforeseen challenges both short and long term. We also see tremendous opportunities to reimagine what's possible for our company and healthcare more broadly. Well, there is much uncertainty as you saw in our press release, we are maintaining our 2020 EPS guidance. We view this as the most reasonable posture given the multitude of offsetting factors across our diversified business. In a moment, John will discuss the financial scenarios underlying our guidance decision in greater detail. As we look ahead, I am confident that our organization will grow stronger based on the learnings from the current crisis, more effective and better prepared to deliver on what we are entrusted to do. As this crisis evolve we are unwavering in our efforts to support the medical and social needs of our consumers, improve total health and well-being and we'll be ready to execute on the momentum we had prior to the onset of the pandemic. I'll now turn it over to John to discuss our financial position. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you Gail and good morning. My objective today is to share with you the actions that we've taken to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our already solid capital position as well as sharing some of the scenarios that form the basis of our outlook, but first I'll briefly review our first quarter results which were both strong and largely unaffected by the current crisis. This morning we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $5.94 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.48. Medical membership totaled 42.1 million members as of the end of the quarter an increase of 1.3 million lives year-over-year and 1.1 million lives sequentially in part through the acquisitions of [indiscernible] and the Missouri and Nebraska Medicaid plans but also aided by our strong organic growth. Medical cost in the quarter were well controlled and slightly better than expectations. As anticipated our individual business margin began to normalize to more sustainable levels where our Medicaid business was on track to achieve the midpoint of our 2% to 4% target margin range by year-end. Our MLR for the quarter was 84.2% exceeding expectations. We had strong cash flow of 1.7 times earnings or 1.3 times earnings normalized for the health insurance fee while simultaneously seeing an increase of almost four days in the days and claims payable metric sequentially. Of note, IngenioRx is now a standalone reportable segment. In the quarter operating gain in the segment was $349 million which includes approximately $75 million to $100 million that under prior segment reporting would have resided in the commercial and specialty business division. That said IngenioRx's core performance is running slightly ahead of prior expectations. As the threat of COVID-19 began to accelerate in mid-March we felt it was prudent to enhance our liquidity by drawing down a total of $600 million from our various credit facilities and an incremental $900 million through the commercial paper market. We are well positioned with total undrawn borrowing capacity of an additional $2.1 billion. Our total debt to capital at the end of the first quarter was 41.7% slightly more than 150 basis points higher than if we had not taken these proactive steps in March to enhance liquidity. We will continue to closely monitor our capital position and evaluate ways to optimize our debt structure including access in capital markets. We also temporarily suspended our share repurchases beginning in the second half of March. It is clear that COVID-19 is having a profound impact on the global economy and there remains significant uncertainty around the shape and timing of an eventual recovery. We have spent considerable time evaluating various scenarios on how COVID-19 and rapidly rising unemployment will impact our financial results. Key factors we evaluated include the anticipated infection rate and hospitalization rate associated with members that contract Corona virus as well as estimating the number that need a ventilator or ECMO machine. The intensity and duration of the infection and the impacts on the healthcare system, unemployment rates, membership mix changes. Thus far we have seen a slight uptick in the Medicaid enrollment as a result of state temporarily suspending reverification efforts and limited changes in our commercial business. As time goes on we expect a more significant shift of commercial group members in the Medicaid and the ACA marketplace. Deferred non-emergent or elective procedures in the eventual timing of a rebound including assessing the capacity of the system and the ability to address pent-up demand. Extended payment terms and the likelihood of higher than normal bad debt expense, lower interest rates and overall capital market conditions. Higher interest expense with the increase borrowing to enhance liquidity and the impact of our decision to temporarily suspend share repurchases. Overall, we estimate that approximately 30% to 40% of our annual medical expense is related to deferrable elective procedures. As a result of deferrals we currently expect the second quarter MLR to be well below of historical levels but expect an elevated MLR in the second half of the year as elective procedures return. We recognize many of your requesting details on our expected business mix changes and the broader impact that COVID-19 on our business. Unfortunately, the rapidly changing environment prevents us today from sharing the level of specificity you would normally expect from us as a management team. We intend to regularly update the investment community as conditions evolve and visibility improves on key operating metrics. We are in uncharted territory and the future may look markedly different from what anyone expects. That said we recognize our business is more diverse and resilient today than in past periods of economic disruption. In 2008, at the time of the Great Recession, commercial and individual customers comprise nearly 75% of our risk-based membership versus less than 30% today. We currently operate Medicaid plans in 23 states and DC and in most of our markets we are first or second in terms of market share. This compares to operating in only 14 states in 2008. At the same time our Medicare Advantage business is expanding and we expect strong growth for the foreseeable future. The diversity of our business today positions Anthem well to mitigate the challenges we see ahead. While the details and metrics underlying our EPS guidance will undoubtedly look different from previous expectations based on our balanced business mix coupled with extensive modeling factoring various scenarios we are maintaining our original full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than $22.30. Operator we will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Stephen Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nStephen Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone. Let me commend you and everyone at Anthem on the work you're doing around the pandemic that you highlighted earlier and question is just around the medical reserves. I guess I'm curious if you're able to provide a little more color on the actuarial process around medical reserving for all the puts and takes related to COVID-19 and then did any extraordinary reserving impact that reported 1Q, \u201820 MLR at all? Wanted to confirm that one way or the other. Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Steve. This is John. I'll just start out by stating that our reserving philosophy is consistent which is both prudent and reasonably conservative. The reserves are estimated based on the immediate view of how claims are developing. Under GAAP accounting we cannot reserve now for claims that will be incurred later in the year which might include accruals for pent-up demand and utilization of elective or discretionary services. So we've been very consistent and conservative with our view -- the impact of COVID-19 actually is rather minimal on the first quarter results and on our March 31 reserve balances is a GAAP accounting does require to only look at what's been incurred through the end of the reporting period. We do have conservatism factors in to ensure that they're all actually justified but really COVID-19 has minimal impact on the March 31 reserve balances. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you for the question Stephen. Again appreciate your comments. We're really proud of the work that all of our associates in Anthem have done to help respond to this incredible humanitarian crisis and as John said I just want to reiterate we've been very consistent in our reserving practices and process. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go at the line of Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate all the details. If the recovery is slower and costs do remain suppressed can you give us a sense of how close you are to MLR floors and potential for MLR rebates and then how that impacts or influences your thoughts around pricing into 2021 just given the timing of all this? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you Ralph. Great questions. First of all in terms of some of the MLR rebates as you know in our individual line of business we have earned above target margins in both 2018 and 2019 and we expected a normalization of that to occur of our margins to occur here in 2020. So obviously regardless of the length or the recovery of the COVID-19 situation, I think individuals kind to have more rebates in any circumstance. In terms of some of the other lines of business well clearly that does play a role in our modeling and in impacting really how the imbalance, inequities in the system might be handled by us throughout the year in terms of the forward view of trend, we will clearly price to the forward view of trend but we'll also have to understand the impacts on the providers, on the members, on the customers here in 2020 and make decisions accordingly.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks Ralph. I'll just follow up a little bit on John's comments because I think he hit the high points. I mean we're closely monitoring the situation and as you know this is emerging information for us around how the Corona virus will translate over the course of this year. At this stage we're really in the early, I would say stages of understanding the cost of treating our patients and including -- we're covering the co-pays and deductibles, etc. but as we think about that fundamentally we believe that as John said, we will put that into, we\u2019ll think about that, think about the entire cost structure for all of our customers and at this stage, the majority of our business is one-one and that as we get into the course of the year we'll have much better information be able to share more of that. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Matthew Borsch. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: Yes. Thank you. I'm just wondering could you just comment on how you think about the trade-off between the commercial and Medicaid membership and/or the Obamacare Exchange members in terms of well, revenues maybe more clear but in terms of the earnings mix and obviously that's going to be pretty different or I would assume for fully insured versus self-funded commercial members.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question Matt. Let me, there's a number of things inside of that. So let me sort of give you a perspective. First and foremost, as we think about what's going on, our priority right now has been really to work with our customers to help them navigate this crisis. In terms of our commercial membership let me sort of break it into each of the individual pieces. Now it's pretty early in this process right now. We do expect that we will see because of the potential high unemployment some impact, certainly impact on our commercial enrollment. The early stages have been muted because of what's happening with furloughs. So thinking about that we have, as John mentioned in his comments we have a much more diversified business than we historically had. Thinking about where that membership would go versus what happened in 2008 in terms of the economic recession then we've had Medicaid expansion. So we would expect 40% to 50% of those members to potentially go into the Medicaid markets and -- in that sense we're fairly well diversified. All 14 of our markets today have both Medicare, I'm sorry Medicaid commercial and the individual exchanges plus there are 10 additional markets and the 24 we covered for Medicaid, where we don't have commercial and obviously have an opportunity to have an impact in those states as well. So again about we think 40% to 50% potentially go into the Medicaid pools. Another probably 30% or so have an opportunity to go into the individual exchanges where we also have a footprint and so that's kind of the break out as we see in terms of enrollment going forward. Another opportunity is we work with our commercial clients, I think they're really trying to understand this impact to their overall business and we have a number of affordable options for them as they think about buy downs in different products and we are seeing an increase in those opportunities but again it's really early for them and our focus has been on them keeping their employees safe and helping them to manage through this but that's roughly how we see the breakdown going forward and we'll know a lot more as we get through this over the next several months because we're pretty early into that process. Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go to line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi good morning. In the prepared remarks you talked about IngenioRx and outperformance that the core is performing ahead of your expectations. Can you just kind of like detail what the sources of the out performance and what's looking better and also the trends in Ingenio as a result of COVID [indiscernible] 90 day has seen an increase. Do you think that this is sustainable and how do you think that the business evolves throughout the year?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you Ricky for that question. I appreciate the opportunity to provide a little clarification on the IngenioRx first quarter results. As you know they're a separate SEC reporting segment effective this quarter and of the operating gain earnings associated with Ingenio over $349 million. That probably differs from what some folks were thinking about the $4 billion of savings that we got from moving to the CBS contract with at least 20% of that dropping to the bottom line and just very simplistic math would say that divided by four quarters that would be about $200 million per quarter. First of all it's very important to note that we had transferred ASO PBM business that our commercial lock had been administering for the last few years into IngenioRx effective January 1 of this year and that added about $75 million to $100 million through the Ingenio performance which obviously took away $75 million to $100 million from the commercial performance on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest of it was really just stronger performance. There was an impact from COVID-19. We did relax the refill too soon requirement in mid-March and we saw really a spike in scripts being filled during March that actually helped the Ingenio performance as well. So the 349 is not run rate because as we look at the rest of the year we do expect that business mix to change with some of the impacts from the economy, Medicaid to grow and then the run rate of scripts is obviously different. We have seen a slight drop in new scripts here in April over historical patterns and so the 349 you cannot just multiply by 4 but those are really the key factors and we're very, very happy with how Ingenio is performing and as you know this is a full year ahead of schedule that we're getting this $800 million dropping to the bottom line effective in for the entirety of 2020. So very happy with the Ingenio performance. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody and best wishes to the entire Anthem team obviously in the midst of this as well but you made the comments in the prepared remarks scale about obviously telemedicine and Telehealth and virtual care is a change that probably persist. I wonder as you guys are seeing this situation evolved, what -- any other areas or maybe even expand on that a little bit but other areas where you think there's changes that are happening that will persist long term and how this crisis is going to impact long-term healthcare delivery in the U.S.?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question A.J. and also thanks for your kind remarks. Now as we think about this again it is an unprecedented time. We did, our first focus was really to ensure that our consumers and members had access to care and we pivoted fairly quickly to virtual care. We've always had capabilities but what we've seen is a real acceleration both through the use of our Sydney app online where people can go, check symptoms, understand where testing sites are and we've seen a dramatic increase of people using those digital capabilities. In addition, our care providers have been able to go online and use virtual care. So it's not only just virtual console but it's also texting and communication. So as we think about this there has certainly been an increase. We do think that as we re-enter the economy obviously and restart it, we have to be incredibly thoughtful, understand what the testing is and the confidence in the economy. So I do think we're going to continue to see use of a virtual care and it will continue to be an important part. It is something we started well before the pandemic but I think it also has accelerated the opportunity and people become more comfortable with it. In addition, sort of physical health the other area that we think there\u2019s significant opportunity is behavioral health and we've seen a big increase in the use of behavioral Telehealth. Again a capability we had Beacon has always had this and we've expanded it as a result of the acquisition of Beacon Healthcare. One in three visits right now we're being used through virtual opportunity and we actually do see that continuing for behavioral and mental health support. So overall, I think that's one of the most interesting. The other opportunity I have is we've been working with our care providers trying to ensure that they are able to support their patients we've seen our own teams through care more and aspire reaching out to those patients and ensuring one of our concerns is that they do get the appropriate care that they need. So our teams have been working with them both on the social supports. So I think that's another area that's really growing and as part of our Medicare Advantage plans today we do offer supplemental benefits that include many of those things. So as I think about this I think we're going to see much more virtual care. I think the social supports are going to continue to be really important behavioral health aspects not only because of loneliness which we've always known but also the use of virtual care is very important. So those are the areas that I think right now we're going to see an uptick and I think we'll see a continued one as people become much more confident in that usage. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go to the line of Justin Lake with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of quick numbers questions for me. First can you give us an update on your Medicaid margin trajectory towards that 3% target by year end and then would appreciate any comments on your employer customers in terms of what you're seeing in April around premium collectability given what's going on in the economy? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Great. Thanks Justin. I'm going to ask Felicia maybe to comment on Medicaid and then I'll go to Pete Haytaian to talk a little bit more about the commercial marketplace. Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Good morning and thank you for the question Justin. When you set aside COVID our Medicaid business was on track to end the year around 3% which is consistent with our original outlook. Our rate actions came in as expected during the quarter and our out of period adjustments were actually negligible. So we really had a clean quarter with respect to Medicaid. When you think about our Medicaid business over 50% of our Medicaid markets have rate actions that occur in the first half of the year. So we have very good visibility around that performance and if we look to the end of 2020 we may remain confident around ending the year at the midpoint of our target margin range of 2% to 4% for Medicaid.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks Felicia. Pete? \nPete Haytaian: Yes. Thanks Justin. I hope you're well and the family is well. As Gail said we recognized that this is obviously a really, really challenging time for our employers and for brokers and we're very focused on creating value for them. We've been in frequent communications with them on providing solutions as it relates to premium collections. This has been a topic of conversation. First on March, March was really in line with normal months as you'd expect COVID-19 didn't really hit until the second or third week. So our premium collections as related to March was generally in line and as it relates to April we are seeing a slight uptick in the month for clients that are utilizing grace periods. In a typical month the percentage of premiums for groups that are basically taking advantage of this is basically 0.5% to 1% versus April we've seen it be around 3%. So a slight uptick but as Gail said we continue to work with our clients on options around affordability and certainly providing solutions around premium payments as a part of that.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks Pete. And just another piece of information Justin, as you think about our overall premium of 70% of our total insured premiums is part of the government business and that has been collected in time and we expect that to continue. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go to the line of Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: First, I certainly appreciate everything you guys are doing during the crisis. My question is really related to a number of the actions you're taking and was interested in what you think the impacts are going to be from a cash flow and investment income standpoint given acceleration of payables may be offset by slower claim submissions and then looking over on the receivable side, kind of a point of maybe some delays in premium collection. Also just had a quick clarification on your dental ASO business membership and maybe what occurred there as well. Thanks a lot.\nJohn Gallina: Sure Lance. This is John. Thank you for the question. The investment income and interest expense it's probably going to be most instructive to view these on a combined basis. So let's just maybe started to beginning of the year and what has happened in the meantime is that the markets experienced a 150 basis point Fed rate cut that we did not anticipate and then we say what's the impact of that, well about 90% of our portfolio is in fixed maturities and they're all very high quality with the duration of over four. And which means that clearly any reinvested earnings are going to be down from what our original expectations would have been. The other 10% of our portfolio certainly has been subjected to a lot of volatility and subject the same way that the overall markets been subject to a lot of volatility and it's sort of difficult to predict where that's going to end up by the end of the year at this point in time. On the debt side we do have some variable rate there. So we have a natural hedge against interest rate dropping and so we'll have a benefit on that side but maybe more importantly in order to optimize liquidity we've accessed more debt and we're carrying really higher levels of short-term cash than normal. And additionally, we do have some bonds that are going to mature in August and November under normal circumstances would have refinance those later in the year but we're going to certainly be opportunistic in terms of timing associated with that and the impacts of carrying net debt. So all in, I would say that we're really looking at the net of investment income and interest expense to be a tailwind, I'm sorry a headwind against us for the rest of the year. So we had a slight tailwind with our first quarter actual results but for the rest of the year we think it will be headwind and we've obviously taken all that in considerations as part of the $22.30 reaffirmation guidance.\nGail Boudreaux: And Lance, in terms of your question on the specialty dental that really is as a result of one large client that we knew we were going to lose. It came to us as the results of our acquisition of DeCare under contract roughly 10 years ago and that contract expired in 2019. So overall our specialty business when you take that out actually had a strong quarter but that was a known loss coming out of this contract expiration as part of an acquisition. Next question please.\nOperator: We will come to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi good morning. I wanted to just ask a little bit for a little more detail on what you're doing with providers both hospitals health systems and your medical groups? I know you alluded to the $3 billion you've made available to providers. I think that's the broader Blue Cross system but just wanted a little more detail on is that just extending liquidity? I'd seen something from Blue Shield's those being done in conjunction with a bank taking the credit risk. I also know you made the $50 million donation to the foundation. So just wondering a little bit, what are you doing with these fee-for-service physician groups who are seeing really dramatic reductions in revenue and income in the near term?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for your question Gary and you're right first of all the $3 billion is part of the entire Blue Cross and Blue Shield system that we have been working really close with. I think part of what makes our affiliation unique here is that just our local and deep roots and we've been sharing best practices and really trying to make sure that we can respond to the needs that we're seeing in our local community. So as part of your direct question on care providers we've been working really closely with them and I've taken several steps to help support them during these challenging times. We've obviously talked a little bit about just the co-pays and things like that but more importantly one of our immediate efforts is to work with them and ensure that payments are made to them on a timely basis. So first and foremost we've been working with each of our provider groups to ensure that their receivables, etc. are important. They're reducing our administrative burden as well taking off pre-authorizations and really our focus has been to help them do what they need to do best which is serve patients in this environment. Proactively, as we think about our focus has also been on working closely in our communities. You mentioned in our fee-for-service providers in our local markets. That's an area that we have worked on each of our communities a little different in terms of their needs but our care provider teams are working with them to try to understand how we ensure that we're a good partner to them as part of our value-based care many of them are in, our value-based care arrangements. So we've been again working with them to support their needs so that they can stay viable during this time as well as enhance their ability to do Telehealth and other things to make sure that they can serve their patients. And on the government side of our business, particularly in Medicaid, we've been working very closely with our state partners to understand those critical providers and that we can provide them the right resources and support across their patient base. So I think as we look at that now one of the things that we also -- I think it is important to point out is that pre-COVID Anthem and the Blues across the system had some of the lowest days and claim payable in the industry. So we were already a fairly quick payer for these providers but even in addition of that we wanted to make sure that any of their receivables we're working to clean that up and ensure that they had separate cash. So those have been the areas that we have been predominantly focused on but again across the system we're sharing best practices and really trying to understand how we help and support providers as they really focus on direct delivery of patient care. Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, this is Chris [indiscernible] on for Sarah. Just a quick question on the commercial book and how are you pricing for the June 1 renewals? So that can you share kind of around the conversation you're having for those and I guess specifically assuming that if we do have a fall COVID-19 peak that will drive some delayed surgeries in \u201921, so you just -- any commentary on pricing for that cost [trend] assumption.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian. I think it's pretty consistent with the previous question as well, Pete maybe to give a little bit more color just to better our commercial business. Pete?\nPete Haytaian: Yes, sure Gail and I think it is consistent. Most of our book as Gail said renews on January 1 and this is such an unprecedented event there are so many moving pieces and parts and so getting our arms around it, this is something that we're very focused on but things will evolve over the next few weeks and months. It will give us t better visibility into rates and what we do with increases in the back half of the year and towards January 1. We feel like we still have time in that regard as it relates to the near term rate increases, we don't have a lot of our book really renewing in the near term and since COVID wasn\u2019t apparent at that time, it was not as greatly considered but as Gail said most of our book renewing in January 1 we have plenty of time once we see how medical costs and deferred electives occur in the back half of the year.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you Pete and also just I think to reiterate, we said this in the earlier commentary but I think it's part we always and we're going to keep saying consistent and disciplined pricing to our forward view of costs but we also recognize that this is a unique situation in terms of what's happening and we will work with our consumers and our customers to ensure that inequities that occur along the way that we are taking that into consideration as we understand the cost patterns of exactly what's happening. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go to the line of Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi good morning. It's Dave [indiscernible] for Windley. First question was just on, I was curious about the use of the $3.2 billion of PBM savings that's not going to shareholders. Is that something which is obviously in your control that you might use to support some of the EPS headwinds that you guys have disclosed and then just a quick second one, I'm wondering if you could provide an apples to apples commercial operating margin comparison than the commercial ASO pharmacies now out of that for the first quarter of this year?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you Dave for the question. So first of all on the $3.2 billion that you're referencing which is the amount that's been provided back to members and consumers to help control healthcare costs associated with our better PBM deal. The way that we approach that is we really looked at each line of business and looked at it from a competitive marketplace, looked at it from a geographic marketplace where we were versus the competitors how close were we to MLR rebate MLR floors and went through and like a Medicare Advantage look that the benefit designs and how we could include our enhanced benefit designs and still ensure we achieve target margins. And we went through a very painstaking process as I said with every line of business geography by geography by geography we end up going a little bit better than the 20% as you can tell by our first quarter operating results. But it's not a lever in and of itself that we could just pull and take a large chunk that down to the bottom line. We are in a very competitive environment and we are trying to deliver the appropriate value to our members at the appropriate pricing. So we've always aspired to do a bit better but it's not just a short-term lever that we can pull. It's something that is part of a larger overall strategy in terms of price points, product designs and all the other types of things. And then the second part of your question associated with just year-over-year comparison. Really the most significant issue is to take the commercial operating gain that's shown in the press release and just go ahead and subtract $75 million to $100 million out of the [op gain] from the first quarter of 2019 and then what you'll have is something that's much closer to an apples to apples comparison of how that commercial segments actually performed year-over-year.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: We will go the line of Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question just on how you're thinking about the exchange strategy in terms of the footprint in participation for next year. I know that you've taken a pretty disciplined approach towards market selection over the last couple of years but clearly just given the significant market shifts that will likely occur on how aggressively you're thinking about ramping that up and then maybe if you could just remind us at this point across your 14 Blue states just in terms of what your current footprint is on the exchange market?\nGail Boudreaux: Great. Thank you for the question, Scott. I'll start and then I'll maybe ask Pete to give a little bit more color on it but I think appreciate your comments because I think you're right on that. We have been -- I think taken an active involvement in the individual market and state in the exchanges but have been prudent in terms of where we think we have the best opportunities to have an impact and we've been balanced. So we modestly expanded our footprint within our 14 states in 2020 but as we shared with you on previous calls we weren't rescaling it. We're really taking a measured balanced approach. We actually feel that we have a really good footprint going into this and an opportunity to offer some really compelling products to our members in those 14 states as part of the individual exchange. So with that maybe I will ask Pete to give some commentary just on the thinking because his team has been really involved in, how we think about the exchanges and our opportunities. Pete?\nPete Haytaian: Yes. Sure. Thanks Gail and thanks Scott for the question. Yes, I am really proud of the team and the approach we've been very thoughtful over the last couple of years with regard to how we expand. We have been expanding our focal point in almost every instance is ensuring that we can partner with the right providers. We look very closely at value-based relationships. We look at where we can partner on critical clinical programs as well as programs like risk adjustment and then obviously where we can have the most viable and affordable product and choice for membership and that strategy's really played through over the last couple of years. We haven't fundamentally changed that and so as we think about what's happening with COVID and the potential recession we still are following those principles but as Gail said with respect to coverage we have pretty decent coverage across our 14 states. It certainly does vary and in some states we are very competitive across most of the counties in the state. In other states we are much more targeted and I don't think we're going to fundamentally change that approach if we can be competitive in many counties in the state we will be, but if we don't feel like we can we're going to be disciplined and not necessarily re-enter.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please. \nOperator: We'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the comments that John made earlier about thinking that about 30% or 40% of the cost that you guys cover are deferrable in some way. I am just wondering is that based upon kind of real-time data? I think most of the providers that we've talked to have said that there is going to be much bigger drop in [indiscernible] would have thought was possible. So just wanted to understand this for your historical view on costs are kind of informed by the real term real time drop in utilization that seems more perverse than average and then just try to get a sense of when you do see drops like this in the past, what percentage goes away versus ultimately gets rescheduled and whether you think that percentage might change this time around?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you Kevin for the question. In terms of the 30% to 40% that was based more on a historical view and it may be closer to the higher end of the range in terms of what we're seeing right now and with real time utilization but that's our historical view and we call it not emergent care and the things you can pick up the phone and schedule but it's been pretty consistent for us over the last couple years when we've done the study and the analysis. In terms of the percent that gets deferred and the pent-up demand is comes back as increased utilization versus what gets canceled all together. We've certainly looked into that and we've studied things like when there were snow days, or when there were hurricanes or natural disasters but those are all helpful, I don't know that they're really going to provide us the exact information we need from a modeling perspective because this is such an unprecedented time and it's just different. The scope and duration of the entire COVID-19 issue is going to be different than anything we've seen and so while we do expect a small amount to not come back it's really too early to provide an estimate or a percentage of what we think will be pent-up demand and the increased utilization in the future but we know that there will be increased utilization in the future once people are more comfortable going back to the hospital and to the doctor.\nGail Boudreaux: And I would also add that we also know and appreciate the patients are avoiding seeking some care in the interim and so that's an area with underlying medical conditions that we are concerned about and that could worsen. So we are closely trying to monitor and help those patients and make sure that they have the right access. So again as John shared this is unlike any of the historical models that we've had. We have certainly done a lot of modeling but at this stage I think it's really hard to give any point estimates about where this will end up and really appreciate your understanding of that. Next question please.\nOperator: Charles Rhyee, your line is open. \nCharles Rhyee: Hi, can you hear me?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Please.\nCharles Rhyee: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the question. First a clarification, I think to an earlier question. I think the question on virtual care. Gail, did you mention on sort of what percent of your ASO clients are currently signed up for LiveHealth Online and is that something that's easily turned on so if clients wanted to access Telehealth, is that something they can get onto for this current period or is that something they'd have to look at for next year? And then secondly, John you were talking about -- we've been talking a lot about sort of deferred cost and one area where we're looking at it seems like investment income came in higher than were expected and I think if you were to annualized the amount in the first quarter will be probably above sort of the guidance range for the full year, yes we've seen rates fall. Is there something in the 1Q number that we're missing here and so if we think that number normalizes for where interest rates have kind of fallen to? We have less share repo as well. We have higher incremental interest expense. Are you kind of implying that the amount of elective procedures? You do expect to come back still, we're going to set the big drop in second quarter, it's going to come back a little bit in third and fourth but net, net we're still going to be down fairly significantly for the full year or do you think at the end of the day we might net out roughly close as we kind of exceed normal capacity let's say in the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thank you for that very thorough question. Now I know we had a gap in the timing. You were accumulating all of those but appreciate the question. We will try to address them. Let me start with first your question about LiveHealth Online. First and foremost Sydney Care which is the app that LiveHealth Online is using as well as our engaged, we've seen more than a 39% increase since 2019 well ahead of our expectations and by the way Sydney Care is part of COVID-19. We have offered to anyone who wants to use it, so this is not a subscription service. You can essentially sign on, download the application, do the Corona virus symptom checking as well as the testing and that's been very strongly used. So we think it's obviously a capability more broadly. But if you think about LiveHealth Online it's one of the aspects of virtual care and again very strong usage but also -- I also think we're going to see more virtual care within our -- sort of traditional care providers because they have also pivoted to that. So not only are we seeing an increased usage in the virtual part of it but also texting back and forth in terms of symptom checking and other things. So a lot of strength their continued. We've seen continued growth. We saw an initial surge certainly when the shelter-in-place orders were given but we're continuing to see that week over week. So I think it's going to continue to grow and again 39% increase so far and I\u2019d expect it to continue to grow through the course of the year. With that I'll ask John maybe address your other questions.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you Charles. So in terms of the investment income and interest expense it's consistent with the question that Lance asked earlier and that is that, we did have a very strong first quarter in that perspective but given all the comments that made before about the 150% basis or a 150 basis points Fed rate cut the fact that 10% of our portfolio has been subject to some extreme volatility. The fact that we're accumulating cash to really address our liquidity issues and to ensure that we have enough cash and assets to maintain and pay all of our claims and accessing the debt markets maybe a little bit earlier than normal on a net basis that will be a headwind for the rest of the year and we just haven't quantified that at this point but it's all part of the $22.30 [indiscernible]. And then the last question on the deferrable procedures in the 30% to 40%. Right now we're expecting that the second quarter medical loss ratio and the second quarter earnings per share will be very favorable to historical numbers and a very low MLR on a comparable basis here in the second quarter and then we do expect the pent-up demand to come in. The real question is what's the duration of the COVID-19 situation before the deferrable procedures really kick back up and there's a very good chance that many of those deferral procedures will work away into 2021. And so when you're looking at 2020 in a vacuum there's a good chance that we'll be in that positive but over the course of a couple of years people will get to care and we will have the cost structure associated.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you John. Next question please.\nOperator: We will go to the line of George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mr. Hill you have taken yourself out of queue. [Operator Instructions]\nGeorge Hill: Hello? \nOperator: Mr. Hill your line is open.\nGeorge Hill: Okay. Sorry. I don't know what happened there team. I guess just we would probably be in the beginning of the PBM and managed care selling season for 2021 right now and I guess I was focused on Ingenio with the market traction it had shown recently. I guess can you say whether or not you started to see the PBM selling season for 2021 start to move as normal with people working remotely and benefits consultants working remotely or you kind of expected selling season to be a push until the \u201821 selling season starter? I guess any comments around the selling season as it relates to the virus would be helpful.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Thank you for the question. I think we are operating in an incredibly rapidly changing environment. I think it's still early to really understand the full implications. With that the way our sales cycle work a lot of activity for the beginning of next year really does occur now and we are seeing a slowdown in decisions. I mean, I think employers are particularly focused on ensuring the safety and health of their employees first and foremost and also trying to understand the implications to their own businesses. With that said we had a really strong pipeline and what we expect across many of these procurement opportunities that they'll just, they'll move out further into next year. And so I think we still have really during opportunities but I do think we are going to see some deferred decisions just because of what's happening across this environment and need for employers really to focus on their own business right now and the health and safety of their employees. With that said I think we've had a very compelling offering and still feel really strongly about the value proposition particularly the opportunities inside of our fee based business and in the commercial business. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: We will go to the line of Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me, okay? \nGail Boudreaux: We can. Thanks Josh. \nJosh Raskin: Excellent. I wanted to follow up on the commercial membership and understand that March was \u201cnormal\u201d month from an enrollment perspective but sort of curious on early membership trends in April and do you get information on furloughs that where people actually maintain their benefits? Are you just getting benefit roles or are you actually getting employment roles? And then sort of the last part of that is just ancillary benefit cross-sell you guys have talked a lot about that trying to increase your ASO fee on a PMPM basis and do you think that sort of slows down the process, you sort of mentioned that the last question that employers are kind of just making sure everybody is okay first. So a couple of questions there just on commercial membership?\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Thanks Josh. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian to answer your questions. Pete?\nPete Haytaian: Yes. Thanks. Josh. Yes with respect to April it hasn't been fundamentally different than March. As Gail said in her commentary we are seeing furloughs accelerate. We obviously had the PPP, the federal relief and folks taking advantage of that. We've been working closely with our employers and brokers on affordable options. We've been working closely with them on creating relief around premium payments. So all that activity as it relates to April, we really haven't, we haven't seen an acceleration yet in disenrollment. We are beginning to see signs of that in the last couple of weeks of April. We did see in group change start to accelerate, so employees beginning to fall off the rolls but not to a very [Technical Difficulty] numbers more broadly we are expecting that to accelerate in the next month or so. And again our focal point has been creating solutions for employers and brokers, buy downs alternative to products, etc. As it relates to furloughs, yes we do get information from clients. We are very closely connected with our brokers and our employers. We've had multiple webinars. We've had multiple outreaches. We're staying close to them. They're actually asking us for a lot of advice around things like that. So for example, if they have, if they're furloughing employees and/or if they're reducing hours of employees what kind of options exist for them. So I think that is part of the reason why you're not seeing as much activity in April out of the gate and then as it relates to our ancillary benefit strategy and our margin improvement in the ASO business, we had a really strong \u201819 in that regard. We had a strong first quarter in that regard. To Gail's point earlier with respect to RFPs slowing down that will inevitably affect us in 2020 as it relates to performing around the 5 to 1 to 3 to 1, but I think the other important part to point out around that is we're selling a lot of incremental value as it relates to going from 5 to 1 to 3 to 1 and it actually translates into affordability. So when you think about critical clinical programs and packaging of those programs, when you think of stop-loss, when you think of pharmacy and the integrated value proposition of pharmacy to the extent that we can sell through on that and have Anthem be a single source solution. I think we're enabling more affordability but that's with eyes wide open and the understanding that some of that may slow down in 2020. We are though once we get out of this we feel very good about continuing on our path to 3 to 1 and if not for COVID, Josh we would stick with what we had said and that is that we were on a path to definitely get to 4 to 1 in 2020. So we might see a slight slowdown in that but it'll pick up again.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks Pete and Josh just a little bit more color on Pete's commentary and your specifics about how do we know what's happening as we do the deep analytics on our business, we are looking at SIC code obviously and just a little bit of color on that, our book does skew a little more towards large municipalities which are a little more stable as well as essential workers right now. So that's why you wouldn't see as much of that kind of furlough activity early on in our book of business. And we're going to take the last question please.\nOperator: And that question comes from the Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nSteve Willoughby: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow up on a comment that John was discussing earlier as it relates to utilization coming back in the back half of the year, John in your prepared remarks you made a comment about assessing the healthcare systems capacity and I was just wondering if you could provide any more color or how you're thinking about that once we get any other side of this virus? How are you guys thinking in terms of the healthcare system being able to absorb capacity or utilization above normal? Thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you Steve. That's a great question and certainly if there's a couple of thousand \u2013 thousands of providers out there, there's probably thousands of answers to that question but there's only so many surgeons, there's only so many beds, there's only so many access or availability to appropriate points of care and it's really difficult to give an exact percentage or difficult to provide something that's really specific from a modeling perspective but as you look at the various facilities that are out there and the information that many of us have -- have available to us from the public marketplace and you look at some of the productivity and capacity percentages at these large public hospitals, you can then make assumptions from there in terms of just how much they can even do. And quite honestly given the duration of this virus in this situation, once the pent-up demand comes through, I don't think it's possible that it'll be able to be handled in a short period of time. I think it's an elongated period of time for the pent-up demand to work its way through the system. And that assumes that everyone is comfortable scheduling their procedures and going back to the hospital and going back to the doctor's offices as well which is another variable on that. So it's just one of many-many-many variables but it's a very important variable. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you John and thank you to everyone who joined us this morning. Despite the challenges facing this country with COVID-19, Anthem is well-positioned to fulfill our promises to those we serve in this new era for healthcare. As we move through this pandemic we'll continue to lead and lend our voices and perspectives across the healthcare system to support our members and customers as well as our care provider and other partners. The lives of those we serve we now changed and in that spirit Anthem is also evolving to create a simpler more affordable and more effective healthcare experience in this new context. I'm confident we will emerge on the other side of this current pandemic even stronger and more nimble as the healthcare partner of choice demonstrating the strength of our brand where Blue Cross and Blue Shield currently serves nearly 1 in 3 people in the United States today. We hope you all stay safe and well and thank you again for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen this conference is available for replay starting at 10:30 A.M.

            "name": "Pete Haytaian",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks Justin. I hope you're well and the family is well. As Gail said we recognized that this is obviously a really, really challenging time for our employers and for brokers and we're very focused on creating value for them. We've been in frequent communications with them on providing solutions as it relates to premium collections. This has been a topic of conversation. First on March, March was really in line with normal months as you'd expect COVID-19 didn't really hit until the second or third week. So our premium collections as related to March was generally in line and as it relates to April we are seeing a slight uptick in the month for clients that are utilizing grace periods. In a typical month the percentage of premiums for groups that are basically taking advantage of this is basically 0.5% to 1% versus April we've seen it be around 3%. So a slight uptick but as Gail said we continue to work with our clients on options around affordability and certainly providing solutions around premium payments as a part of that. Yes, sure Gail and I think it is consistent. Most of our book as Gail said renews on January 1 and this is such an unprecedented event there are so many moving pieces and parts and so getting our arms around it, this is something that we're very focused on but things will evolve over the next few weeks and months. It will give us t better visibility into rates and what we do with increases in the back half of the year and towards January 1. We feel like we still have time in that regard as it relates to the near term rate increases, we don't have a lot of our book really renewing in the near term and since COVID wasn't apparent at that time, it was not as greatly considered but as Gail said most of our book renewing in January 1 we have plenty of time once we see how medical costs and deferred electives occur in the back half of the year. Yes. Sure. Thanks Gail and thanks Scott for the question. Yes, I am really proud of the team and the approach we've been very thoughtful over the last couple of years with regard to how we expand.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us. Across the globe and right here at home we're facing a critical humanitarian crisis. All of us are impacted and our hearts go out to those struggling. I will focus my comments this morning on the impact of the COVID-19 global health crisis on our business along with the actions we've taken to provide support and relief. I will direct you to the earnings released for the financial results for the first quarter. Let me begin by saying how incredibly grateful I am to the men and women including many of Anthem's own clinical associates fighting in the frontlines of this healthcare crisis from small rural communities to the heart of New York City. I am also incredibly proud of the more than 77,000 Anthem associates who have been providing compassionate and tireless support for our customers, members, care providers and communities each day as we battle this pandemic together to ensure the safety and health of our associates and support the nationwide efforts to contain the virus. In March, we began transitioning our employees away from offices and now have nearly 99% working safely at home. In recognition of these unprecedented times, we are offering our associates up to 80 hours of additional paid leave providing online workouts, expanding mental health support and have increased our Anthem Cares Emergency Relief Fund to help associates manage through this crisis. Anthem has long served and met the unique needs of our local communities. Our commitment to improving lives and communities is core to our mission and we have approached our response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a local and personal lens. Anthem along with our association of 35 other independent and locally operated Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies have committed nearly $3 billion to ensure that more than a 100 million Americans along with care providers and hospitals have access to the resources and support they need to help improve the health of America. Because of our strong blue brand and deep local roots we were well-positioned to work quickly and seamlessly with local, state and federal officials, local care providers, key customers and community partners from day one of the pandemic. And our associates are at the forefront of our comprehensive efforts. Our Anthem culture and values serve as our foundation for giving back in our local communities. Our deeply committed associates have been giving back in various ways such as online teaching, outreach via phone or mail to those isolated at home, making masks for non-healthcare industry workers, helping to provide personal care supplies and providing meal delivery to those homebound by the crisis across the country with partners like the American Red Cross, Boys & Girls Club, Feeding America and Americares. Anthem is on the forefront of delivering relief and support to those most impacted. We know there is great fear and uncertainty among consumers right now, particularly when it comes to safe and affordable access to care. We've removed barriers to care by waiving caution for treatment of COVID-19 including coverage for testing, treatment and inpatient hospital stays. We've waived prior authorizations for COVID-19 diagnostic tests and related covered services as well as ensured continuity of care by waiving early prescription refill limits on 30-day maintenance medications and encouraging the use of 90-day mail-order benefits if applicable. We've also expanded access to Telehealth & nurselines for both medical and emotional health to meet the growing needs for 24 by 7 information, support and care. For our most vulnerable consumers in Medicare and Medicaid we've also reinforced our long-standing focus on social drivers of health to provide support with food, housing, transportation and more. From outreach to isolated seniors and families to donating meals and other needed personal care items, we are working to ensure our members needs are being met, that they realize they are not alone in this fight against the virus. Our associates working with these populations are demonstrating their endless compassion and care during this time as well. We've seen examples of our team members personally delivering boxes of food and much needed supplies safely to our members and dire need. Their commitment is inspiring but not surprising this is how Anthem shows up every day to serve others. At the core of the crisis there's been tremendous focus on the need for testing and no bigger push for that testing than in the crisis epicenter of New York City. There we've partnered with the coalition of Asian American IPA to provide free mobile testing in the five boroughs across the city. We also established the Anthem Medical Associate Volunteer Program for associates with professional medical training and licensure, the volunteers at hospitals and other clinical settings in a variety of states including New York where the needs are so great. Our clinical associates are demonstrating Anthem's strong values and commitment to service as they stand fearlessly on the frontlines to deliver critical care. As Anthem's care provider partners continue their important work in local markets across the country we have simplified policies designed to help them deliver care to patients more quickly and effectively. Unless otherwise required under specific state and federal mandates, we have suspended prior authorization requirements for patient transfers and use some medical equipment critical to COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, Anthem is covering respiratory services for acute treatment of COVID-19 along with in-network and out-of-network coverage for COVID-19 laboratory testing. The actions we've taken are ensuring that healthcare providers are focused where they need to be with their patients. Partnerships are foundational to our work in Anthem. Today we're partnering with XPRIZE and other industry leaders to form a global pandemic alliance to combat COVID-19 and leverage learning to help prepare for future pandemics. Across the digital landscape, Anthem has been collaborating extensively with various state and federal partners as well as other private sector partners to innovate and help simplify the entire healthcare system experience through the use of technology. Anthem's digital first capabilities are proactively addressing issues with COVID-19 to simplify healthcare for consumers. Our Sydney Care mobile app and the new Corona virus assessment tool are helping people safely and conveniently assess their risk of having COVID-19, locate testing sites as may be needed and connect directly with a doctor via our virtual care solution. To date, we've seen more than 170,000 downloads of the app and a witness to 250% surge in virtual care engagements via text and video. This crisis has made clear the Telehealth and virtual care will continue to be a key component of how and where care is delivered going forward. Our employer partners are certainly feeling the impacts of the crisis. Anthem is working closely with our customers to ensure not only the safety and well-being of their employees but to also provide affordable, flexible payment terms as they work through the financial implications of COVID-19. We recognize this action may add payment risk to our business. We also know it's the right thing to do. The economic impacts of the crisis may also drive an unprecedented shift in consumers from the employer market into our Medicaid and ACA segments. We are quickly reallocating resources as may be needed to meet these potential challenges. In the small group market a segment especially vulnerable to disruption, we are proactively identifying groups at risk and providing more affordable product offerings. We're helping displace members find coverage in the individual marketplace or in Medicaid. Anthem entered 2020 in a position of strength, ready to achieve our financial objectives and serve as a trusted partner in health. Our first quarter performance was in line with our expectations and while we know COVID-19 is likely to produce unforeseen challenges both short and long term. We also see tremendous opportunities to reimagine what's possible for our company and healthcare more broadly. Well, there is much uncertainty as you saw in our press release, we are maintaining our 2020 EPS guidance. We view this as the most reasonable posture given the multitude of offsetting factors across our diversified business. In a moment, John will discuss the financial scenarios underlying our guidance decision in greater detail. As we look ahead, I am confident that our organization will grow stronger based on the learnings from the current crisis, more effective and better prepared to deliver on what we are entrusted to do. As this crisis evolve we are unwavering in our efforts to support the medical and social needs of our consumers, improve total health and well-being and we'll be ready to execute on the momentum we had prior to the onset of the pandemic. I'll now turn it over to John to discuss our financial position. John? Thank you for the question Stephen. Again appreciate your comments. We're really proud of the work that all of our associates in Anthem have done to help respond to this incredible humanitarian crisis and as John said I just want to reiterate we've been very consistent in our reserving practices and process. Next question please. Yes. Thanks Ralph. I'll just follow up a little bit on John's comments because I think he hit the high points. I mean we're closely monitoring the situation and as you know this is emerging information for us around how the Corona virus will translate over the course of this year. At this stage we're really in the early, I would say stages of understanding the cost of treating our patients and including -- we're covering the co-pays and deductibles, etc. but as we think about that fundamentally we believe that as John said, we will put that into, we'll think about that, think about the entire cost structure for all of our customers and at this stage, the majority of our business is one-one and that as we get into the course of the year we'll have much better information be able to share more of that. Thank you. Next question please. Thanks for the question Matt. Let me, there's a number of things inside of that. So let me sort of give you a perspective. First and foremost, as we think about what's going on, our priority right now has been really to work with our customers to help them navigate this crisis. In terms of our commercial membership let me sort of break it into each of the individual pieces. Now it's pretty early in this process right now. We do expect that we will see because of the potential high unemployment some impact, certainly impact on our commercial enrollment. The early stages have been muted because of what's happening with furloughs. So thinking about that we have, as John mentioned in his comments we have a much more diversified business than we historically had. Thinking about where that membership would go versus what happened in 2008 in terms of the economic recession then we've had Medicaid expansion. So we would expect 40% to 50% of those members to potentially go into the Medicaid markets and -- in that sense we're fairly well diversified. All 14 of our markets today have both Medicare, I'm sorry Medicaid commercial and the individual exchanges plus there are 10 additional markets and the 24 we covered for Medicaid, where we don't have commercial and obviously have an opportunity to have an impact in those states as well. So again about we think 40% to 50% potentially go into the Medicaid pools. Another probably 30% or so have an opportunity to go into the individual exchanges where we also have a footprint and so that's kind of the break out as we see in terms of enrollment going forward. Another opportunity is we work with our commercial clients, I think they're really trying to understand this impact to their overall business and we have a number of affordable options for them as they think about buy downs in different products and we are seeing an increase in those opportunities but again it's really early for them and our focus has been on them keeping their employees safe and helping them to manage through this but that's roughly how we see the breakdown going forward and we'll know a lot more as we get through this over the next several months because we're pretty early into that process. Thank you. Next question please. Next question please. Thanks for the question A.J. and also thanks for your kind remarks. Now as we think about this again it is an unprecedented time. We did, our first focus was really to ensure that our consumers and members had access to care and we pivoted fairly quickly to virtual care. We've always had capabilities but what we've seen is a real acceleration both through the use of our Sydney app online where people can go, check symptoms, understand where testing sites are and we've seen a dramatic increase of people using those digital capabilities. In addition, our care providers have been able to go online and use virtual care. So it's not only just virtual console but it's also texting and communication. So as we think about this there has certainly been an increase. We do think that as we re-enter the economy obviously and restart it, we have to be incredibly thoughtful, understand what the testing is and the confidence in the economy. So I do think we're going to continue to see use of a virtual care and it will continue to be an important part. It is something we started well before the pandemic but I think it also has accelerated the opportunity and people become more comfortable with it. In addition, sort of physical health the other area that we think there's significant opportunity is behavioral health and we've seen a big increase in the use of behavioral Telehealth. Again a capability we had Beacon has always had this and we've expanded it as a result of the acquisition of Beacon Healthcare. One in three visits right now we're being used through virtual opportunity and we actually do see that continuing for behavioral and mental health support. So overall, I think that's one of the most interesting. The other opportunity I have is we've been working with our care providers trying to ensure that they are able to support their patients we've seen our own teams through care more and aspire reaching out to those patients and ensuring one of our concerns is that they do get the appropriate care that they need. So our teams have been working with them both on the social supports. So I think that's another area that's really growing and as part of our Medicare Advantage plans today we do offer supplemental benefits that include many of those things. So as I think about this I think we're going to see much more virtual care. I think the social supports are going to continue to be really important behavioral health aspects not only because of loneliness which we've always known but also the use of virtual care is very important. So those are the areas that I think right now we're going to see an uptick and I think we'll see a continued one as people become much more confident in that usage. Next question please. Great. Thanks Justin. I'm going to ask Felicia maybe to comment on Medicaid and then I'll go to Pete Haytaian to talk a little bit more about the commercial marketplace. Felicia? Thanks Felicia. Pete? Thanks Pete. And just another piece of information Justin, as you think about our overall premium of 70% of our total insured premiums is part of the government business and that has been collected in time and we expect that to continue. Next question please. And Lance, in terms of your question on the specialty dental that really is as a result of one large client that we knew we were going to lose. It came to us as the results of our acquisition of DeCare under contract roughly 10 years ago and that contract expired in 2019. So overall our specialty business when you take that out actually had a strong quarter but that was a known loss coming out of this contract expiration as part of an acquisition. Next question please. Thanks for your question Gary and you're right first of all the $3 billion is part of the entire Blue Cross and Blue Shield system that we have been working really close with. I think part of what makes our affiliation unique here is that just our local and deep roots and we've been sharing best practices and really trying to make sure that we can respond to the needs that we're seeing in our local community. So as part of your direct question on care providers we've been working really closely with them and I've taken several steps to help support them during these challenging times. We've obviously talked a little bit about just the co-pays and things like that but more importantly one of our immediate efforts is to work with them and ensure that payments are made to them on a timely basis. So first and foremost we've been working with each of our provider groups to ensure that their receivables, etc. are important. They're reducing our administrative burden as well taking off pre-authorizations and really our focus has been to help them do what they need to do best which is serve patients in this environment. Proactively, as we think about our focus has also been on working closely in our communities. You mentioned in our fee-for-service providers in our local markets. That's an area that we have worked on each of our communities a little different in terms of their needs but our care provider teams are working with them to try to understand how we ensure that we're a good partner to them as part of our value-based care many of them are in, our value-based care arrangements. So we've been again working with them to support their needs so that they can stay viable during this time as well as enhance their ability to do Telehealth and other things to make sure that they can serve their patients. And on the government side of our business, particularly in Medicaid, we've been working very closely with our state partners to understand those critical providers and that we can provide them the right resources and support across their patient base. So I think as we look at that now one of the things that we also -- I think it is important to point out is that pre-COVID Anthem and the Blues across the system had some of the lowest days and claim payable in the industry. So we were already a fairly quick payer for these providers but even in addition of that we wanted to make sure that any of their receivables we're working to clean that up and ensure that they had separate cash. So those have been the areas that we have been predominantly focused on but again across the system we're sharing best practices and really trying to understand how we help and support providers as they really focus on direct delivery of patient care. Next question please. Sure. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian. I think it's pretty consistent with the previous question as well, Pete maybe to give a little bit more color just to better our commercial business. Pete? Thank you Pete and also just I think to reiterate, we said this in the earlier commentary but I think it's part we always and we're going to keep saying consistent and disciplined pricing to our forward view of costs but we also recognize that this is a unique situation in terms of what's happening and we will work with our consumers and our customers to ensure that inequities that occur along the way that we are taking that into consideration as we understand the cost patterns of exactly what's happening. Next question please. Next question please. Great. Thank you for the question, Scott. I'll start and then I'll maybe ask Pete to give a little bit more color on it but I think appreciate your comments because I think you're right on that. We have been -- I think taken an active involvement in the individual market and state in the exchanges but have been prudent in terms of where we think we have the best opportunities to have an impact and we've been balanced. So we modestly expanded our footprint within our 14 states in 2020 but as we shared with you on previous calls we weren't rescaling it. We're really taking a measured balanced approach. We actually feel that we have a really good footprint going into this and an opportunity to offer some really compelling products to our members in those 14 states as part of the individual exchange. So with that maybe I will ask Pete to give some commentary just on the thinking because his team has been really involved in, how we think about the exchanges and our opportunities. Pete? Next question please. And I would also add that we also know and appreciate the patients are avoiding seeking some care in the interim and so that's an area with underlying medical conditions that we are concerned about and that could worsen. So we are closely trying to monitor and help those patients and make sure that they have the right access. So again as John shared this is unlike any of the historical models that we've had. We have certainly done a lot of modeling but at this stage I think it's really hard to give any point estimates about where this will end up and really appreciate your understanding of that. Next question please. Yes. Please. Well, thank you for that very thorough question. Now I know we had a gap in the timing. You were accumulating all of those but appreciate the question. We will try to address them. Let me start with first your question about LiveHealth Online. First and foremost Sydney Care which is the app that LiveHealth Online is using as well as our engaged, we've seen more than a 39% increase since 2019 well ahead of our expectations and by the way Sydney Care is part of COVID-19. We have offered to anyone who wants to use it, so this is not a subscription service. You can essentially sign on, download the application, do the Corona virus symptom checking as well as the testing and that's been very strongly used. So we think it's obviously a capability more broadly. But if you think about LiveHealth Online it's one of the aspects of virtual care and again very strong usage but also -- I also think we're going to see more virtual care within our -- sort of traditional care providers because they have also pivoted to that. So not only are we seeing an increased usage in the virtual part of it but also texting back and forth in terms of symptom checking and other things. So a lot of strength their continued. We've seen continued growth. We saw an initial surge certainly when the shelter-in-place orders were given but we're continuing to see that week over week. So I think it's going to continue to grow and again 39% increase so far and I'd expect it to continue to grow through the course of the year. With that I'll ask John maybe address your other questions. Thank you John. Next question please. Sure. Thank you for the question. I think we are operating in an incredibly rapidly changing environment. I think it's still early to really understand the full implications. With that the way our sales cycle work a lot of activity for the beginning of next year really does occur now and we are seeing a slowdown in decisions. I mean, I think employers are particularly focused on ensuring the safety and health of their employees first and foremost and also trying to understand the implications to their own businesses. With that said we had a really strong pipeline and what we expect across many of these procurement opportunities that they'll just, they'll move out further into next year. And so I think we still have really during opportunities but I do think we are going to see some deferred decisions just because of what's happening across this environment and need for employers really to focus on their own business right now and the health and safety of their employees. With that said I think we've had a very compelling offering and still feel really strongly about the value proposition particularly the opportunities inside of our fee based business and in the commercial business. Thank you. Next question. We can. Thanks Josh. Sure. Thanks Josh. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian to answer your questions. Pete? Thanks Pete and Josh just a little bit more color on Pete's commentary and your specifics about how do we know what's happening as we do the deep analytics on our business, we are looking at SIC code obviously and just a little bit of color on that, our book does skew a little more towards large municipalities which are a little more stable as well as essential workers right now. So that's why you wouldn't see as much of that kind of furlough activity early on in our book of business. And we're going to take the last question please. Thank you John and thank you to everyone who joined us this morning. Despite the challenges facing this country with COVID-19, Anthem is well-positioned to fulfill our promises to those we serve in this new era for healthcare. As we move through this pandemic we'll continue to lead and lend our voices and perspectives across the healthcare system to support our members and customers as well as our care provider and other partners. The lives of those we serve we now changed and in that spirit Anthem is also evolving to create a simpler more affordable and more effective healthcare experience in this new context. I'm confident we will emerge on the other side of this current pandemic even stronger and more nimble as the healthcare partner of choice demonstrating the strength of our brand where Blue Cross and Blue Shield currently serves nearly 1 in 3 people in the United States today. We hope you all stay safe and well and thank you again for joining us."

When you set aside COVID our Medicaid business was on track to end the year around 3% which is consistent with our original outlook. Our rate actions came in as expected during the quarter and our out of period adjustments were actually negligible. So we really had a clean quarter with respect to Medicaid. When you think about our Medicaid business over 50% of our Medicaid markets have rate actions that occur in the first half of the year. So we have very good visibility around that performance and if we look to the end of 2020 we may remain confident around ending the year at the midpoint of our target margin range of 2% to 4% for Medicaid."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you Gail and good morning. My objective today is to share with you the actions that we've taken to enhance our liquidity and strengthen our already solid capital position as well as sharing some of the scenarios that form the basis of our outlook, but first I'll briefly review our first quarter results which were both strong and largely unaffected by the current crisis. This morning we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $5.94 and adjusted earnings per share of $6.48. Medical membership totaled 42.1 million members as of the end of the quarter an increase of 1.3 million lives year-over-year and 1.1 million lives sequentially in part through the acquisitions of [indiscernible] and the Missouri and Nebraska Medicaid plans but also aided by our strong organic growth. Medical cost in the quarter were well controlled and slightly better than expectations. As anticipated our individual business margin began to normalize to more sustainable levels where our Medicaid business was on track to achieve the midpoint of our 2% to 4% target margin range by year-end. Our MLR for the quarter was 84.2% exceeding expectations. We had strong cash flow of 1.7 times earnings or 1.3 times earnings normalized for the health insurance fee while simultaneously seeing an increase of almost four days in the days and claims payable metric sequentially. Of note, IngenioRx is now a standalone reportable segment. In the quarter operating gain in the segment was $349 million which includes approximately $75 million to $100 million that under prior segment reporting would have resided in the commercial and specialty business division. That said IngenioRx's core performance is running slightly ahead of prior expectations. As the threat of COVID-19 began to accelerate in mid-March we felt it was prudent to enhance our liquidity by drawing down a total of $600 million from our various credit facilities and an incremental $900 million through the commercial paper market. We are well positioned with total undrawn borrowing capacity of an additional $2.1 billion. Our total debt to capital at the end of the first quarter was 41.7% slightly more than 150 basis points higher than if we had not taken these proactive steps in March to enhance liquidity. We will continue to closely monitor our capital position and evaluate ways to optimize our debt structure including access in capital markets. We also temporarily suspended our share repurchases beginning in the second half of March. It is clear that COVID-19 is having a profound impact on the global economy and there remains significant uncertainty around the shape and timing of an eventual recovery. We have spent considerable time evaluating various scenarios on how COVID-19 and rapidly rising unemployment will impact our financial results. Key factors we evaluated include the anticipated infection rate and hospitalization rate associated with members that contract Corona virus as well as estimating the number that need a ventilator or ECMO machine. The intensity and duration of the infection and the impacts on the healthcare system, unemployment rates, membership mix changes. Thus far we have seen a slight uptick in the Medicaid enrollment as a result of state temporarily suspending reverification efforts and limited changes in our commercial business. As time goes on we expect a more significant shift of commercial group members in the Medicaid and the ACA marketplace. Deferred non-emergent or elective procedures in the eventual timing of a rebound including assessing the capacity of the system and the ability to address pent-up demand. Extended payment terms and the likelihood of higher than normal bad debt expense, lower interest rates and overall capital market conditions. Higher interest expense with the increase borrowing to enhance liquidity and the impact of our decision to temporarily suspend share repurchases. Overall, we estimate that approximately 30% to 40% of our annual medical expense is related to deferrable elective procedures. As a result of deferrals we currently expect the second quarter MLR to be well below of historical levels but expect an elevated MLR in the second half of the year as elective procedures return. We recognize many of your requesting details on our expected business mix changes and the broader impact that COVID-19 on our business. Unfortunately, the rapidly changing environment prevents us today from sharing the level of specificity you would normally expect from us as a management team. We intend to regularly update the investment community as conditions evolve and visibility improves on key operating metrics. We are in uncharted territory and the future may look markedly different from what anyone expects. That said we recognize our business is more diverse and resilient today than in past periods of economic disruption. In 2008, at the time of the Great Recession, commercial and individual customers comprise nearly 75% of our risk-based membership versus less than 30% today. We currently operate Medicaid plans in 23 states and DC and in most of our markets we are first or second in terms of market share. This compares to operating in only 14 states in 2008. At the same time our Medicare Advantage business is expanding and we expect strong growth for the foreseeable future. The diversity of our business today positions Anthem well to mitigate the challenges we see ahead. While the details and metrics underlying our EPS guidance will undoubtedly look different from previous expectations based on our balanced business mix coupled with extensive modeling factoring various scenarios we are maintaining our original full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance of greater than $22.30. Operator we will now open it up for questions. Thank you, Steve. This is John. I'll just start out by stating that our reserving philosophy is consistent which is both prudent and reasonably conservative. The reserves are estimated based on the immediate view of how claims are developing. Under GAAP accounting we cannot reserve now for claims that will be incurred later in the year which might include accruals for pent-up demand and utilization of elective or discretionary services. So we've been very consistent and conservative with our view -- the impact of COVID-19 actually is rather minimal on the first quarter results and on our March 31 reserve balances is a GAAP accounting does require to only look at what's been incurred through the end of the reporting period. We do have conservatism factors in to ensure that they're all actually justified but really COVID-19 has minimal impact on the March 31 reserve balances. Thank you. Thank you Ralph. Great questions. First of all in terms of some of the MLR rebates as you know in our individual line of business we have earned above target margins in both 2018 and 2019 and we expected a normalization of that to occur of our margins to occur here in 2020. So obviously regardless of the length or the recovery of the COVID-19 situation, I think individuals kind to have more rebates in any circumstance. In terms of some of the other lines of business well clearly that does play a role in our modeling and in impacting really how the imbalance, inequities in the system might be handled by us throughout the year in terms of the forward view of trend, we will clearly price to the forward view of trend but we'll also have to understand the impacts on the providers, on the members, on the customers here in 2020 and make decisions accordingly. Thank you Ricky for that question. I appreciate the opportunity to provide a little clarification on the IngenioRx first quarter results. As you know they're a separate SEC reporting segment effective this quarter and of the operating gain earnings associated with Ingenio over $349 million. That probably differs from what some folks were thinking about the $4 billion of savings that we got from moving to the CBS contract with at least 20% of that dropping to the bottom line and just very simplistic math would say that divided by four quarters that would be about $200 million per quarter. First of all it's very important to note that we had transferred ASO PBM business that our commercial lock had been administering for the last few years into IngenioRx effective January 1 of this year and that added about $75 million to $100 million through the Ingenio performance which obviously took away $75 million to $100 million from the commercial performance on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest of it was really just stronger performance. There was an impact from COVID-19. We did relax the refill too soon requirement in mid-March and we saw really a spike in scripts being filled during March that actually helped the Ingenio performance as well. So the 349 is not run rate because as we look at the rest of the year we do expect that business mix to change with some of the impacts from the economy, Medicaid to grow and then the run rate of scripts is obviously different. We have seen a slight drop in new scripts here in April over historical patterns and so the 349 you cannot just multiply by 4 but those are really the key factors and we're very, very happy with how Ingenio is performing and as you know this is a full year ahead of schedule that we're getting this $800 million dropping to the bottom line effective in for the entirety of 2020. So very happy with the Ingenio performance. Thank you for the question. Sure Lance. This is John. Thank you for the question. The investment income and interest expense it's probably going to be most instructive to view these on a combined basis. So let's just maybe started to beginning of the year and what has happened in the meantime is that the markets experienced a 150 basis point Fed rate cut that we did not anticipate and then we say what's the impact of that, well about 90% of our portfolio is in fixed maturities and they're all very high quality with the duration of over four. And which means that clearly any reinvested earnings are going to be down from what our original expectations would have been. The other 10% of our portfolio certainly has been subjected to a lot of volatility and subject the same way that the overall markets been subject to a lot of volatility and it's sort of difficult to predict where that's going to end up by the end of the year at this point in time. On the debt side we do have some variable rate there. So we have a natural hedge against interest rate dropping and so we'll have a benefit on that side but maybe more importantly in order to optimize liquidity we've accessed more debt and we're carrying really higher levels of short-term cash than normal. And additionally, we do have some bonds that are going to mature in August and November under normal circumstances would have refinance those later in the year but we're going to certainly be opportunistic in terms of timing associated with that and the impacts of carrying net debt. So all in, I would say that we're really looking at the net of investment income and interest expense to be a tailwind, I'm sorry a headwind against us for the rest of the year. So we had a slight tailwind with our first quarter actual results but for the rest of the year we think it will be headwind and we've obviously taken all that in considerations as part of the $22.30 reaffirmation guidance. Thank you Dave for the question. So first of all on the $3.2 billion that you're referencing which is the amount that's been provided back to members and consumers to help control healthcare costs associated with our better PBM deal. The way that we approach that is we really looked at each line of business and looked at it from a competitive marketplace, looked at it from a geographic marketplace where we were versus the competitors how close were we to MLR rebate MLR floors and went through and like a Medicare Advantage look that the benefit designs and how we could include our enhanced benefit designs and still ensure we achieve target margins. And we went through a very painstaking process as I said with every line of business geography by geography by geography we end up going a little bit better than the 20% as you can tell by our first quarter operating results. But it's not a lever in and of itself that we could just pull and take a large chunk that down to the bottom line. We are in a very competitive environment and we are trying to deliver the appropriate value to our members at the appropriate pricing. So we've always aspired to do a bit better but it's not just a short-term lever that we can pull. It's something that is part of a larger overall strategy in terms of price points, product designs and all the other types of things. And then the second part of your question associated with just year-over-year comparison. Really the most significant issue is to take the commercial operating gain that's shown in the press release and just go ahead and subtract $75 million to $100 million out of the [op gain] from the first quarter of 2019 and then what you'll have is something that's much closer to an apples to apples comparison of how that commercial segments actually performed year-over-year. Thank you Kevin for the question. In terms of the 30% to 40% that was based more on a historical view and it may be closer to the higher end of the range in terms of what we're seeing right now and with real time utilization but that's our historical view and we call it not emergent care and the things you can pick up the phone and schedule but it's been pretty consistent for us over the last couple years when we've done the study and the analysis. In terms of the percent that gets deferred and the pent-up demand is comes back as increased utilization versus what gets canceled all together. We've certainly looked into that and we've studied things like when there were snow days, or when there were hurricanes or natural disasters but those are all helpful, I don't know that they're really going to provide us the exact information we need from a modeling perspective because this is such an unprecedented time and it's just different. The scope and duration of the entire COVID-19 issue is going to be different than anything we've seen and so while we do expect a small amount to not come back it's really too early to provide an estimate or a percentage of what we think will be pent-up demand and the increased utilization in the future but we know that there will be increased utilization in the future once people are more comfortable going back to the hospital and to the doctor. Thank you Charles. So in terms of the investment income and interest expense it's consistent with the question that Lance asked earlier and that is that, we did have a very strong first quarter in that perspective but given all the comments that made before about the 150% basis or a 150 basis points Fed rate cut the fact that 10% of our portfolio has been subject to some extreme volatility. The fact that we're accumulating cash to really address our liquidity issues and to ensure that we have enough cash and assets to maintain and pay all of our claims and accessing the debt markets maybe a little bit earlier than normal on a net basis that will be a headwind for the rest of the year and we just haven't quantified that at this point but it's all part of the $22.30 [indiscernible]. And then the last question on the deferrable procedures in the 30% to 40%. Right now we're expecting that the second quarter medical loss ratio and the second quarter earnings per share will be very favorable to historical numbers and a very low MLR on a comparable basis here in the second quarter and then we do expect the pent-up demand to come in. The real question is what's the duration of the COVID-19 situation before the deferrable procedures really kick back up and there's a very good chance that many of those deferral procedures will work away into 2021. And so when you're looking at 2020 in a vacuum there's a good chance that we'll be in that positive but over the course of a couple of years people will get to care and we will have the cost structure associated. Thank you Steve. That's a great question and certainly if there's a couple of thousand \u2013 thousands of providers out there, there's probably thousands of answers to that question but there's only so many surgeons, there's only so many beds, there's only so many access or availability to appropriate points of care and it's really difficult to give an exact percentage or difficult to provide something that's really specific from a modeling perspective but as you look at the various facilities that are out there and the information that many of us have -- have available to us from the public marketplace and you look at some of the productivity and capacity percentages at these large public hospitals, you can then make assumptions from there in terms of just how much they can even do. And quite honestly given the duration of this virus in this situation, once the pent-up demand comes through, I don't think it's possible that it'll be able to be handled in a short period of time. I think it's an elongated period of time for the pent-up demand to work its way through the system. And that assumes that everyone is comfortable scheduling their procedures and going back to the hospital and going back to the doctor's offices as well which is another variable on that. So it's just one of many-many-many variables but it's a very important variable. Thank you for the question."

Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives and close on Anthem's commitment to its mission. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share Anthem once again delivered solid operating results in the fourth quarter, capping off another year of outstanding growth, as we transform with focus and discipline from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. I'll start by sharing performance highlights for the quarter and the year and follow with some key actions and investments that drove our growth and laid the groundwork for what we expect will be another year of strong operating performance in 2022. In the fourth quarter, Anthem delivered GAAP earnings per share of $4.63 and adjusted earnings per share of $5.14 ahead of expectations and against the backdrop of COVID-19. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $24.73 and adjusted earnings per share of $25.98, reflecting a 16% increase year-over-year. During 2021, our investments in enhancing the customer experience, delivering innovative, customized whole health solutions and deepening digital engagement helped to deliver strong growth across our health benefits businesses, all while rapidly scaling our diversified health services solutions. We ended the year with 45.4 million members, up 2.4 million or 6% year-over-year, with approximately 3/4 of those gains coming from organic growth. In our Commercial business, improved selling strategies and innovative customized product offerings sustained our momentum and led to the best ever selling season for our national accounts team. In addition, traction is accelerating as we address clients' unique needs in targeted subsegments such as balanced funding for midsized employers and customized plans and digital tools for college students. The flexible architecture of our Sydney Health mobile app enables seamless integration into clients' ecosystems, while helping deepen digital engagement with members in this fast-growing market. As a result, we anticipate delivering another year of growth in our Group and Individual businesses in 2022. For many employers, our focus on affordability and integrated whole health solutions is prompting consolidation with Anthem, eliminating other medical carriers and integrating pharmacy management. Consequently, IngenioRx saw significant growth in net new sales to start 2022, keeping us on track with our goal of narrowing the profitability gap of risk-based and fee-based Commercial customers. Moving to Medicare Advantage, our continuing work to strengthen Anthem's value proposition helped drive another strong annual election period. Customers want their benefits to meet their needs today and in the future, and packages like our everyday extras that offer holistic services such as transportation, personal home health, and healthy pre-prepared meal delivery are resonating because they provide the flexibility to choose what matters most to each individual. Offering flexible and personalized benefits will remain a key part of our approach in individual MA and we expect ongoing enhancements to power another year of double-digit growth in 2022. We also expect a substantial membership increase in group Medicare Advantage when our contracts serving the retirees of the City of New York begins on April 1st. This timing is consistent with the recent court ruling that upheld our contract and extended the open enrollment period for an additional three months. In Medicaid, our team did an outstanding job in 2021 demonstrating the differentiated value we offer states built on our deep understanding of the needs of their communities. Our rich legacy of investing in community health uniquely positions us to address health disparities with solutions that extend beyond clinical care to improve health outcomes. Our 100% RFP win rate included renewals of our statewide contracts in Tennessee and Indiana and a new statewide contract in Ohio, which will help further deepen our roots in that state given our leading market share positions in commercial and Medicare Advantage. Then as we begin serving Ohio in July, our pending acquisition of Paramount Advantage's Ohio Medicaid contract will amplify our Medicaid footprint. This investment follows our pending acquisition of Integra, a New York managed long-term care plan that will strengthen our presence and capabilities in the greater New York City area. These examples demonstrate our commitment to strategic and programmatic M&A. And we've become more agile and proactive as we target health plans that deepen our existing benefits business and acquisitions, which diversify and expand our addressable markets. A good example is our myNEXUS acquisition, which enables members to live healthier lives in their homes. myNEXUS has performed well to-date, driven partly by its expanding scope within Anthem. In addition, we expect the ongoing aging of the population and consumer preference for at-home care to propel growth for years to come. Over the last year, we significantly advanced our care provider strategy with investments in risk bearing primary care providers and aggregators, while enhancing value-based arrangements across our network. These arrangements accounted for more than 60% of our medical expense last year. We expect this strategy to accelerate membership growth, increase star ratings and improve health outcomes and cost of care. Investing in providers and aggregators secures joint governance to maintain alignment of shared interest with our partners, giving Anthem value from sharing risk and elevating the customer and provider experience. Importantly, this strategy ensures Anthem is not overly reliant on one care model as value-based care matures. Our diversified business group will increasingly benefit from these arrangements by opportunities to service Anthem's providers with enablement programs and other diversified services, many of which target the needs of complex and chronic patient populations where we see significant opportunities to improve outcomes, access and total cost of care. We expect to remain flexible and thoughtful in our provider strategy, partnering in most markets and investing in care delivery and others where it makes sense. We also made meaningful headway in our digital transformation during the quarter with accelerated investments to deepen digital engagement and meet the increasing need for convenience and personalized care. During our peak onboarding period earlier this month, digital registrations rose 150%, and visits to Sydney Health grew 142%. Capabilities and investments in artificial intelligence, which power our personalization engine are helping optimize the customer experience and reduce low-value administrative tasks. For example, our virtual primary care platform builds real-world learnings on commercial members' usage patterns and preferences to anticipate customer needs and offer customized experiences, and automating the on-boarding process delivers better experiences by saving time and improving the accuracy of critical data and the quality of virtual visits. To illustrate, more than 1,000 emergency room visits were avoided last month by predicting and addressing adverse health events through our virtual care options. Results like this are encouraging, and we're excited to accelerate the pace. Anthem enters 2022 with strong growth momentum across all of our businesses. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver growth in adjusted earnings per share consistent with our long-term target range of 12% to 15%, as John will discuss more in a moment. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue investing in profitable growth, innovating for consumers and advancing our digital platform for health as we work to achieve our purpose of improving the health of humanity. As part of our community health and sustainability commitments, I'm pleased to share, we recently met our 100% renewable electricity goal four years ahead of schedule and are now producing enough clean energy via off-site purchase agreements to power all of the Anthem's offices, data centers and clinics. It's gratifying to see our efforts earn Anthem a place on the 2021 Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year and on JUST Capital's 2022 rankings of America's most just companies. We're also in the early stages of leveraging insights derived from a dynamic model, tracking the health of our communities across local, social and clinical drivers. We call it our whole health index, and we believe it will help us more closely assess our progress towards helping people live healthier lives. In its simplest form, the index will help us identify the most promising opportunities to improve the health of our members and their communities. To date, we've leveraged the index to design and launch programs to manage obesity in five of our Medicaid states, where this health issue is especially severe. We're currently learning from field tests and are excited about the possibilities ahead, notably in diabetes prevention and customized wellness campaigns for employers based on the needs of their employees. As part of our ongoing work to support our customers' health, we also began offering risk-based Commercial members free at-home COVID tests through our Sydney app starting last November, Delivered within one to two business days, the kits allow members to test safely without leaving the comfort of their homes. This program has positioned us well to comply with the administration's recent requirement to provide home testing at no cost. In closing, I'll leave you with these three takeaways. Anthem's fiscal year 2021 performance demonstrates our strategy to become a lifetime trusted partner in health is helping unlock Anthem's full potential. With our plans and continued investments for fiscal year 2022, we are excited about our ability to sustain this momentum and deliver growth in the years ahead. And our strategic approach to innovation and digital transformation enables us to move even faster and with greater agility as we accelerate our digital platform for health and offer new ways to attract, engage and retain more customers while streamlining our business and simplifying the consumer experience. Now I'd like to welcome John to add his view on the quarter and our outlook for 2022. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail stated, we are pleased to have delivered solid fourth quarter financial results, closing out another year of strong growth, driven by the continued execution of our long-term strategy, all while navigating the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic. Fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.14 was ahead of our expectations and drove full year adjusted earnings per share to $25.98 reflecting growth of approximately 16% year-over-year, above our long-term 12% to 15% annual earnings per share growth target. Total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $36 billion, an increase of more than 14% over the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth in our benefits business, coupled with continued momentum in our services businesses. We closed the year with 45.4 million members growth of nearly 6% or 2.4 million members in the year, including 303,000 lives added just during the fourth quarter and with growth in both our Government and Commercial businesses. This was the 14th consecutive quarter in which we grew total medical membership, underscoring the strength and resilience of our core benefits businesses through periods of economic strength and periods of economic uncertainty. In 2021, we grew our government membership over 17% driven by organic growth in Medicaid, another year of double-digit organic growth in Medicare Advantage and the acquisition of MMM. Commercial enrollment grew modestly as solid growth in our risk-based areas were partially offset by in-group attrition in our fee-based business due to broader labor market dynamics that occurred during the year. Our fourth quarter benefit expense ratio was 89.5%, an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year quarter, driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. As expected, total medical costs in the quarter were above normal or baseline levels but still compared favorably to our expectations driven by lower utilization of non-COVID care partially offset by higher-than-expected COVID-related costs, notably in December. Anthem's SG&A ratio in the fourth quarter was 11.7% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 200 basis points over the prior year quarter. Excluding adjustment items noted in our press release, our adjusted SG&A ratio would have been 11.1% down approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. The decrease was driven by the repeal of the health insurer tax and the expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by increased investments to support our growth and digital transformation efforts afforded by outperformance in our investment income. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $1.7 billion, bringing full year 2021 operating cash flow to $8.4 billion or 1.4x net income. Our fourth quarter and full year cash generation beat our expectations, reflecting strong operating performance this year, as well as a shift in the timing of the planned payment of our share of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement. We now expect to make this payment of approximately $500 million in 2022, which is included in the guidance we provided this morning for operating cash flow of greater than $6.9 billion. We ended 2021 with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, in line with our expectations and well within our targeted range. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable ended the year at 45.2 days, an increase of 1.8 days year-over-year, with medical claims payable up 19% year-over-year compared to premium revenue increasing by 13%. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our stock at a weighted average price of $417.92. For the year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $1.9 billion, ahead of our original guidance of $1.6 billion. We were opportunistic in the year, capitalizing on periods of market volatility, notably during the fourth quarter. Turning to our outlook for 2022. We are pleased to provide initial guidance, including adjusted earnings per share of greater than $28.25, which reflects growth of at least 12% from the normalized adjusted earnings per share baseline of $25.20 in 2021. As a reminder, we benefited from significant investment income outperformance during the year, including amounts that we believe to be non-recurring. We offset a portion of the upside in the fourth quarter by accelerating investments in our business. In total for the year, we believe nearly $0.80 of our adjusted earnings per share to be outside of our run rate. Accordingly, we continue to view $25.20 as the appropriate starting point for our growth in 2022. We expect to end 2022 with total medical membership in the range of 45.6 million to 46.2 million members. This outlook includes the expectation of generating double-digit organic growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage business and the launch of our group Medicare Advantage contract serving the retirees of the City of New York in April, to add at least 200,000 group Medicare Advantage lives, while shifting a like number of members out of our commercial fee-based enrollment, given that we currently serve the city's retirees on a self-insured basis. In all, Medicare Advantage membership is expected to grow in the mid-teens percentage range. Our outlook also reflects strong growth in our Commercial risk and fee-based businesses, including a strong starting point due to a record selling season for national accounts. We expect commercial fee-based membership to grow by 2% to 3% or 530,000 to 730,000 members net after covering the transition of our more than 200,000 existing fee-based members in New York into our new group Medicare Advantage contract and low single-digit growth in our commercial risk-based members. With respect to Medicaid, our guidance assumes that public health emergency will end in mid-April as is currently planned with Medicaid eligibility redeterminations resuming around the middle of the year. Correspondingly, we expect to capture our commensurate share of growth in commercial fee and risk-based markets as consumers losing Medicaid benefits migrate to employer-sponsored coverage and individual plans. As you might expect, our membership outlook for our Commercial and Medicaid business is highly dependent on the timing and pace of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations. The launch of our new statewide Medicaid contract serving Ohio in July is also contemplated in our guidance range, while membership associated with pending acquisitions is not. We expect continued momentum in our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx segments with revenue growth on a combined basis in the low to mid-teens. Altogether, the momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses will drive operating revenue up 11% year-over-year to approximately $152 billion. This includes approximately $130 billion of premium revenue, also up 11% over 2021, representing an increase of nearly $13 billion. The consolidated benefit expense ratio is expected to be 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in 2022, consistent with our initial outlook for 2021. At the midpoint, this reflects a 50 basis point increase year-over-year driven primarily by the launch of our New York Group Medicare Advantage contract. With respect to the impacts of COVID on our overall cost structure, we anticipate another year in which the overall cost of care will track above normalized levels driven by COVID-related treatment, vaccination, and testing costs. We expect the SG&A expense ratio to be 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in 2022, reflecting a reduction of 60 basis points at the midpoint of the range relative to our adjusted SG&A ratio in 2021. The reduction was primarily driven by operating expense leverage due to strong growth in revenue, in addition to the benefits of our ongoing modernization efforts, including workflow automation and digitization. This is partially offset by continued investment in our initiatives that will drive future growth and the operating efficiencies, including digital engagement and system migrations. We expect our operating gain for the year to be greater than $8.4 billion reflecting growth of at least 8% year-over-year over adjusted operating earnings in 2021. Below the line, investment income is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion and interest expense is expected to be approximately $840 million. Our effective income tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%, consistent with 2021. Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $6.9 billion, which includes the anticipated payment of our share of the BCBSA litigation settlement, which, as I noted earlier is approximately $500 million. From a capital deployment perspective, our long-term targets remain unchanged, and we will continue to pursue programmatic M&A in an effort to enhance the organic growth of our existing operations and diversify and extend our capabilities, moving us closely to our goal of becoming a lifetime trusted partner in health. While our guidance does not include any benefit from future or pending M&A, it does contemplate a 4% to 5% contribution to growth in adjusted earnings per share associated with capital deployment, including M&A completed in 2021, notably MMM and myNEXUS, and anticipated share repurchases of at least $1.5 billion in 2022 that we expect will drive our weighted average share count into the range of 243 million to 244 million shares outstanding for the full year. With respect to seasonality, we are projecting profitability patterns close to our historical ranges and expect to earn approximately 55% of our income in the first half of the year, although earnings in the first and second quarter will be split roughly evenly. Our guidance assumes that our benefit expense ratio will approximate the midpoint of our full year range in the first quarter, which we believe will be a prudent assumption in light of the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I am also pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized and increased our quarterly dividend of more than 13% to $1.28 per share, continuing our track record of increasing our dividend every year since we began paying dividends in 2011. Our new dividend annualizes to $5.12 per share, a yield of approximately 1.2% based on our current share price. In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another year of strong growth despite significant challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While much of the backdrop remains uncertain, we are committed to managing the uncertainty thoughtfully and prudently. We look forward to making further progress against our strategy and delivering on our financial commitments once again in 2022. Operator, we will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. So regarding Medicare Advantage, there's obviously been a lot of industry discussion related to the external telephonic sales channel. Just curious if you can give us an update on how important you think that channel is in relation to your growth outlook in individual MA. Can you also remind us again where you stand on your internal sales and distribution capabilities for individual MA? Is this something that you're content with as far as the sizing right now? Are you looking to expand that further? Thanks\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Steve. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government Business, to respond.\nFelicia Norwood: So good morning, Steven. Thank you for that question. First and foremost, let me say that we are very pleased with our overall performance during this past AEP, and we're on track for another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage business. When we think about distribution, we meet our members where they want to be met from a sales perspective, and that means providing them with a range of distribution options. The EMO channel represents an important and valuable distribution partner for us. We saw an acceleration in this channel prior to the pandemic, and we've long recognized the value that they bring in educating consumers about Medicare options and, equally important, the differentiated value that Anthem provides. This AEP for us wasn't meaningfully different in terms of our distribution mix, and we are going to continue to provide a distribution mix that represents being able to meet our consumers at the full end of the spectrum. We believe in the strong value of MA. It's a very solid business, and we really provide a strong value proposition for consumers. So we continue to evaluate all the time our mix, but we feel good about where we're positioned today with our distribution mix.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Steve. And I'll just sort of summarize what Felicia said. I mean I think we felt we had a very strong AEP. We're expecting double-digit growth and very consistent from our perspective around the competitive market as well as the distribution channels. So thanks for the question. And next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. First, I wanted to just follow up on Steve's question there in terms of the specific around the third-party marketing. The focus has been on churn. So I'd be curious what you've seen on churn. And then I know there's some more compliance that CMS is looking for there. So do you think that affects the market or the effectiveness of that market? And then my question was just around commercial trend. Can you talk about testing costs in 2022 and what you're thinking there? And then just, overall, I know you said you had -- John, you said that there'd be some consistency in terms of an expectation of trend above normal? Any differences in 2022 versus 2021 on -- by segment, given that commercial seems to be running hotter than the government going into the year? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thank you, Justin. There were a number of questions there, so we'll try to address. Let me first take the first one around Medicare Advantage. Overall, I think very consistent competitive environment. When you talk about churn specifically, we're not seeing anything significantly different than we've seen in the past. It's been a competitive market. It remains a competitive market. As I shared, we feel that our supplemental benefits and the things that we do to help support Medicare beneficiaries has been very positive. And also, we spent a lot of time on ensuring that through our marketing and other things that our members understand the components of our benefits and have a good welcome experience with us. But again, we see that as pretty consistent. I'm going to ask John to address the questions that you had more specifically around trend.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, Justin, for the questions. In terms of trends by lines of business, and as I had stated in the prepared comments, overall, total COVID was higher than anticipated, but non-COVID more than offset it. And so our total cost structure, while above baseline, was better than our expectations. Commercial had the highest cost compared to baseline. You look at what happened in the fourth quarter. Children were eligible for vaccines for the first time. You had the Omicron surge, et cetera. Medicare was next in line with overall cost structure of adding COVID and non-COVID combined to be slightly above baseline. And Medicaid overall, actually ended the quarter slightly below baseline. But all in, the total is what I said. As you look to 2022, there's consistent themes, and we're not going to go into specific trends by line of businesses. But, overall, we expect Commercial to have the highest amount of cost compared to baseline of the three lines of business for the year and Medicare to be second and Medicaid to be third. So very consistent 2022 expectations versus fourth quarter actuals. So thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just following up, John, on the comments on the MLR. I think you said that first quarter MLR would be kind of consistent with the annual range. That's a fair bit higher than, I think, how it typically trends. So could you maybe just go into some more detail on what you're expecting to play out in the first quarter and what's driving that step-up? Thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Good morning, Nathan, and thank you for the question. And maybe I'll address earnings seasonality and MLR seasonality somewhat consistently, because they obviously drive each other. You look at the seasonality of earnings patterns that we've had historically as a company, we've had 55%, 60%, closer to 60% of our money we make in the first six months of the year pre-pandemic. That obviously has shifted the last couple of years and which are really not the best benchmarks to use now for analysis purposes. And now we look at what we expect this year. We expect closer to 55% of our money to be earned in the first half. And then we expect the first and second quarter to be relatively consistent with each other. First quarter MLR, as you pointed out, will be a bit higher than historical patterns. A few key reasons for that. We ended 2021 going into 2022 with an Omicron surge. That was impacting our Commercial business, maybe a bit more than other lines, consistent with how I just answered Justin's question. There's a spike in hospitalizations that we're going through. We do expect non-COVID to drop, but the quarterly timing maybe isn't quite as clear. One other comment just to make -- to help clarify maybe a change in seasonality patterns is, we're within the public health emergency right now. And the public health emergency has many, many provisions associated with it. One of those is that any COVID diagnostic testing or cost structure, we need to waive co-pays and deductibles. And so, if you think about our historic seasonality patterns and the historic fact that, at the beginning of the year, that co-pays and deductibles are a significant part of the leverage between quarters, you don't have that to quite the same level during a public health emergency. And while those co-pays and deductibles are still in effect for the full year, they do not apply to COVID-type cost structures, and so we have a shift of cost between quarters. And then in the second quarter, we do expect COVID to be a little bit less severe than it is in the first quarter, and so that will impact our MLR positively. But we also launched the City of New York Group Retiree business and that excellent contract that we won. And so that will put upward pressure on the MLR in the second quarter. So all-in, we think we're in pretty good shape, and we want to be very prudent in terms of how we're assessing the COVID, the pandemic and our guidance. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, John. And I guess I would reiterate, as John said, there are a number of moving parts to this, but we feel that we've taken those into consideration and wanted to share our thoughts on certainly the first half of the year but feel confident in the way we've managed through it in 2021 and heading into 2022. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody. I know Pete took over the Diversified Business Group operation in October. And I wondered if I could get either Gail or Pete, to talk a little bit about where the near to intermediate-term opportunity. I know you mentioned a lot of things that touch on DBG in your prepared remarks. But what are the two or three or four big opportunities for DBG looking over the next year or two?\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, A.J. And I will turn this over to Pete Haytaian to share his perspective, but I think there's a few things, going back to my remarks. One, clearly, a huge opportunity for us in IngenioRx as well, and we shared how well that business is performing and the opportunity that we have to continue to embed the Ingenio as part of our whole health solutions into particularly mid-market accounts, and we've done a nice job there. And then in terms of the Diversified Business group, again, serving our complex and chronic patients has been an area of focus for a number of years, and we're seeing acceleration in that. So I'll ask Pete to give some specific points about where he sees that growth coming from.\nPeter Haytaian: Yeah. Thanks, Gail, and thanks, A.J. Appreciate it. I continue to be really energized about the opportunity. As Gail said, serving the complex and the chronically ill really aligns well with our core business and where we're seeing the trends go in our core business. I'd say of paramount importance is the opportunity to penetrate Anthem more as it relates to our core existing offerings, a tremendous opportunity to expand our product portfolio and offer new products for these complex populations. I'd say we're very focused on, at least I am and the team in the short term, on how a lot of these solutions stitch together and extend to create further value. For example, if you think about myNEXUS, which, as Gail said in her prepared comments is performing really well, its connection to the home, it allows us to consider a lot of extension product opportunities. So when you think about that more specifically, the post-acute care opportunity, and we're actually going to be launching some new post-acute care product offerings this upcoming year. When you think about managing durable medical equipment and the opportunity there. And then importantly, as we've talked about for the last several quarters, the importance of social drivers of health and how much is occurring in the home, so that's one area that we are very interested in. And then again, how you weave IngenioRx into this also plays a critical role in terms of specialty pharmacy and potentially home infusion, et cetera. And I think the other really important point, as we put these product offerings together and stitch them together, it creates tremendous proof points as it relates to our opportunities externally. With the Blues and our Blue partners, we currently have 26 Blue clients. I think there's tremendous opportunity to improve that. And then importantly, with those Blue clients, we have 10 with multiple solutions. So I look forward to the opportunity to create value in Anthem and then extend that externally as well.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thank you, Pete. And I think you heard from Pete, there's really two huge opportunities for us for accelerating growth. One, deeper penetration inside of Anthem, and we're beginning to bring all of these products together in a much more integrated way; and two, the opportunity through our provider strategy, our aggregator strategy to use our diversified business assets to participate in the profit pools in that area. So those are two, we think, growth opportunities for us in the future. And again, it's early days, but we're seeing some really nice progress in these early days. Thanks for the question. Next one, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Hi. Thanks for the question. I don't think I heard you talk too much about the outlook for the Individual, Commercial business during prepared remarks. Was hoping you could give us a sense of where membership there is expected to be for 2022 in that business and then how you're thinking about profitability in 2022 in light of your expectations around COVID and anything you want to touch on for competitive dynamics there. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick, who leads that business, to provide some commentary.\nMorgan Kendrick: Hey there, Stephen. Thank you for the question. I -- first of all, I'd say we are expecting growth in our individual business this cycle. You asked about our margin trajectory on that and how we felt about it. Clearly, we're expecting to -- we price the business accurately. We price it based on our forward view of trend. COVID certainly is a big piece of that. And when we think about it, we've adjusted pricing as necessary, but we're seeing -- and we're still in open enrollment for 1/1. Some of them are extended through the end of the month. And right now, things are looking quite good. You would imagine there are some states, there are puts and takes across the country. But nonetheless, we feel good about it, and we're expecting growth in the first quarter. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Just want to go back to thinking about medical costs. And John, you talked about overall cost of care being above, and you talked a lot about COVID. But how do we think about any elective procedures that have been pushed off due to COVID would be my first question. And then secondly, as you looked at Delta versus Omicron, it appears at least from the seat I sit in, that it was much less severe. A lot more people had testing and other types of costs. But how do we think about if there is that next variant -- now that we'll have a treatment in the marketplace, obviously, a lot more testing, how do we think about how that cost progressed and what that means to pushing off incremental elective procedures to have those costs offset? So how do I think about that in total?\nJohn Gallina: Sure. Thank you, Lisa, for the questions. I'll see if I can unpack them all with this answer. But in terms of access to the health care system, over the past year, we really have not seen anyone that has been denied access to needed -- necessary care. And so while there may have been some puts and takes and some pent-up demand in the past, we think the vast, vast majority of that has all passed. And while that does happen on a temporary basis during some of these surges, the system is able to accommodate. So -- and the other thing I think is very clear that we've seen is that whenever there is a COVID surge, that there has historically now been a non-COVID drop that is a natural hedge against it. In terms of the just the cost trend in general and other variants, I certainly don't want to predict what the next variant's going to look like or even what letter of the Greek alphabet it's going to be named after. But on the other hand, as we look at Omicron, Omicron is clearly less severe on a per-member basis, but far more contagious. So you look at really the number of people who are infected by it, it's more multiplicatively higher than the number of people that were infected by Delta or the original COVID, and then the hospitalization rates are then a fraction. But you look at it sort of on a year-over-year basis, the hospitalization rates are relatively consistent in total and maybe even up a little bit for Omicron. So it's really hard to say exactly what the next variant is going to look like, but we model these things. We try to be very thoughtful and even prudent and conservative in the way that we've modeled it. And I think you can see our 2021 performance has shown that we are a bit conservative in the way that we assess these things, and we're going to continue that same thought process for 2022. So thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland. Please go ahead.\nRob Cottrell: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on the commercial fee growth and the outlook for 2% to 3% membership growth. Just curious, are those members coming in with higher specialty attachment rates that keep you on track for the 3:1 margin targets, or is that something that potentially pushes that target out, given the stronger growth?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question. Just to clarify a little bit, when we talk about the profitability between fully insured and our self-insured business or risk versus fee, we're really talking about adding more services to the fee-based business. So I wasn't sure if I understood your question correctly, but we are making great progress on that. We had predicted that we would end the year on 4:1, which we did. And we're seeing, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the opportunity to add IngenioRx plus clinical services, advocacy. So there's a whole number of areas that have begun to gain traction in that. So we feel very much on target, feel good about it. If you think about just our fee-based revenue in the fourth quarter increase 12% compared to a year ago, when revenue increased over -- and for the year increased over 7%, so this growth came despite somewhat flattish membership growth. I think that really punctuates the impact of the various buy-up programs that we had. So, again, overall, I feel like we're making really good progress on that. Your question about the 2% plus risk-based membership growth, we feel that, that's a prudent projection going into the year. We had very strong growth in 2020, but feel good about where we are positioned. There was a previous question about our individual membership. Again, we have taken, I think, a very steady and consistent approach to the individual market. We did that again this year. So we don't look for outsized growth in any one of those markets, but consistent growth across our risk base and in the 14 states where we do business. So, again, feel good about it, making progress around all of those. And, again, we are making progress on that profit targetability. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit about your value-based care delivery strategy and was interested in the stake you've taken in some companies recently and how you look at -- how you kind of parcel out the country with respect to those, one. Also, has your appetite for owning care delivery changed? And then last, as you're thinking about partnering with other Blues, is this a capability that you could provide to other Blues in some sort of way? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, Lance, thank you very much for the series of questions, and let me try to kind of go through each of them and give you a bit of a perspective. As I shared in my opening remarks, I think we've been very consistent actually in our care provider and our value-based strategy over the years. Specifically, your question comes to what it relates to primary care, I think we've always taken a very thoughtful approach to how we leverage our scale in the market because we do believe that's one of the critical criteria for success. Recently, we shared and have updated everyone on some of the partnerships. Our model primarily has been a partnership model. So our investments, for example, in Privia and Adalat are the two that I think you're referring to, but there have been others that we've also shared. When you talk about taking an ownership position, again, that's something we have done in the past. So it's not -- I know often we get the question of why we don't do it. We have done it actually and where it makes sense in our local markets and based on the depth and the dynamics. And good examples, very early on with CareMore but also HealthSun simply, most recently last year when we bought MMM. So we're not against owning care delivery, but we do think in areas where we want to own it would be where we can accelerate our membership growth. And predominantly in areas where complex and chronic patients, we can improve the impact we have there, obviously, increase our Star ratings and improve the health outcomes and by partnering is one of the important parts in our aggregators. I want to take a minute on the aggregator strategy and why we're investing in some of these because they also allow us to stand up joint governance structures. And my prior answer, we talked a little bit about making sure that we remain aligned with our care provider partners. So that's a great way for us to participate in the governance structure and be aligned with our care providers and be very direct about our partnership preference where we can do it. So as you think about these partnerships, they also benefit our Diversified Business Group. Again, going back to my last answer, we see an opportunity to wrap around different provider enablement programs. Also some of the acquisitions we've done recently are good examples of where we can do pull-through, and we can participate in the profit pool in a broader way, so very consistent with that. They're very capital-efficient for us. And again, our focus is very much on complex and chronic, and we see significant opportunities. So I guess I would conclude our strategy is different than our others, and we see that as unique because of the set of assets that we have are very unique, and we want to leverage that depth and, again, that partnership that we've built. It also allows us to derive value from sharing risk and ensuring that we're not reliant on any single model. As we know, this value-based space continues to evolve and mature. We don't think that one model is going to work in every market. We fundamentally believe that care is delivered locally and that's the core to who we are and how we've grown up as a company. And so we see each model as unique, but we do think that there's an opportunity for scale and to wrap around, particularly our DBG assets, and to drive differentiated outcome. In terms of your last question, we do share a lot of these models with our partner, Blues, particularly in states where we have JVs already. So yeah, we do think there's opportunities for us to take a leadership role there and work closely. Other Blues have great ideas, and we also learned from them. So we think this is an opportunity where the market is going to change quite a bit, and we're going to keep optionality and be very capital efficient but also drive through, I think, a differentiated cost structure, and that's kind of where we start today. So thank you very much for the question, and next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. I just had a quick follow-up on the 2022 MLR guidance, that 88% midpoint, up about 50 basis points. How do we think about mix impacting that this year? Obviously, that group MA account would push it higher, but the Medicaid redeterminations, we would think about bringing consolidated MLR down. And I just want to think about the mix impact versus your comment that overall cost of care will still run above baseline in 2022. And just are you implying that there are certain lines of business where the MLR moves up because that underlying trend isn't priced for 2022?\nJohn Gallina: Gary, thank you for the question, and I really do appreciate the opportunity to provide clarity because it's actually an excellent question that you've asked. The increase in MLR is essentially entirely driven by mix. So we have the state of New York -- or I'm sorry, the City of New York, Medicare Advantage contract that goes live. It's going to be in excess of 200,000 members launching April 1. That will increase the overall MLR of the company. We have just general growth in various other areas. We acquired MMM mid-year 2021. We will have a full year of MMM in 2022. The overall aspect of that is that the weighted average MLR for the entire company goes up. We'd go live with Ohio mid-year as well in our new Medicaid win. So when you -- our Medicare Advantage on an individual basis is growing by double-digits, really outpacing every other line of business we have in the company, and the average MLR associated with those new members increases the MLR of the company. So the core underlying MLRs associated with each of the lines of business, the forward pricing aspects of including COVID, we feel very good about and feel very solid about. But the analysis of the 50 basis point increase, it's entirely mix. So thank you for the opportunity to provide that clarification.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: Yes. I had a regional question, which is you talked about the New York market. It seems like you're making progress in a number of fronts there. Can you just talk about the small group market? As I recall, you pulled out of the small group market, I want to say, maybe eight years ago. And is kind of -- as I understand it, kind of dysfunctional the way it's structured, and you've got a lot of small groups that are going into sort of private employer pools as a result. I'm just wondering, I realize this is kind of region-specific, but if you'd be willing to address that.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. As you can appreciate, we won't go into details on specific markets and really won't comment on one area in particular. Overall, our small group market, we feel really good about, particularly the alternative and submarket strategy that we've launched over the last several years and have continued to make gains in it. So our products are resonating there quite well. We added a virtual-only product this year. That's having -- gaining a lot of traction but, again, won't speak to specific markets. Thanks for the question. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes. Hi, good morning. So just as a follow-up, on the cost of care in 2022, that's coming in above normal trend. Just for context, how does it compare to the $600 million in COVID costs that were in 2021, the headwinds? And then with the Blue settlement now finalized, how big is the opportunity when you think about market expansion into new states?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Ricky. I'll answer your first question on the cost of care, and then maybe I think Gail wants to make a couple of comments on the Blue settlement. But associated with the cost of care, I did not say that we would be above normal trend. I said that the cost structure would be above baseline. So I just want to make sure that the nuance of those words is very clear to everyone on the line. In terms of how that compares the COVID headwind and the $600 million, I'll just say COVID headwinds, there's many different things associated with them. Certainly, there's treatment cost, vaccine administration and testing that all go through cost of care. Our COVID headwinds, though, encompassed everything associated with COVID that might include things like the impact on risk adjustment revenue, not necessarily cost of care but clearly an item that's going to impact revenue and impact the bottom line. And then offsets, it will include drop in non-COVID utilization, pricing actions and various other aspects. And those are just examples of a very, very long list. And so in 2021, we did estimate that about $600 million of net headwinds, and while each bucket maybe didn't come out exactly how we had predicted, the overall estimate was reasonable. And so you look into 2022, our net headwind is smaller. For instance, risk adjustment revenue should be improved compared to 2021 as you look at the amount of utilization that occurred in the Medicare Advantage in 2020 versus 2021, we should have better risk scores. But additionally, we've continued our pricing discipline. So anyway, so thank you for the question. I just want to make sure that we are clear on exactly what the headwind related to and the size of it. Gail?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the second question, Ricky. In terms of the BCBSA litigation, just to clarify, as you know, the final approval hearing was held in October of 2021, and that court took the matter under advisement, which is typical for cases of this size and scale. And so, some of the account members have submitted objections, which they're working through right now, and that's not unusual, so it's pretty typical for a case of the size. So in terms of projecting what this all means, et cetera. As John said, we expect to pay the settlement in 2022 versus what we had previously projected in 2021. We fully accrued for that. In terms of the overall market, I think it's too early to say. I mean we've always worked inside of the Blue system with our peer plans. We have a number of seeds, and so I really don't have a comment on that until we get through the overall process. But, again, I feel that, that will get resolved in 2022. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. You guys, I guess, I don't remember you going in and specifically quantifying the impact of having to cover in-home testing. Can you just talk a little bit about how you guys thought about it? Is that not an issue, because you already assume COVID cost? Is it an issue because there's offsets on the PCR front? Any color there about how the size or think about how you came to your net impact?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. In terms of home testing, I think, it is a good opportunity to provide a little clarity on just how we're thinking about it. First of all, let me point out, and I know everyone is quite aware of this, that we're already paying for a significant volume of testing, mostly inside of medical facilities. And generally, these tend to be eight to 10 times the price of the at-home test. In addition, you add on the office fee. So while it's difficult to know the exact degree, to which the home testing or testing will go up as a result of the role, we do expect some substitution with lower cost home test displacing some of those tests that are currently done in the medical facilities. It's also, as you heard in my opening remarks, we proactively began offering free home COVID test to our risk-based commercial members through Sydney Health in November. And those tests right now are delivered to our members' homes within one to two business days and our early experience indicates that individuals are ordering these based on their need and there's been appropriate usage. In respect to our guidance, we did consider the effect of the substitution, the availability of the four free tests per household that the federal government is supplying, current short-term supply constraints and the likelihood of spikes in demand in the year that would drive potential surges in the COVID case rate. So those tended to go inside, as you know, with the lower non-COVID utilization. So that should be a natural offset, as John has shared earlier in the call. So bottom line, there's pretty wide range or there is a wide range of outcomes around the world, but we believe that our guidance provided that this morning captures the most likely net impact in our financial results. And that's one reason why our cost structure is expected to be at/or above baseline in the four quarters of 2022. So overall, we feel we've used our analytics to do our best assessment. And again, we do have some experience with the test through our Sydney app. So thanks very much for allowing us to clarify how we're thinking about that. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Thanks for squeezing me in. I believe you've talked about 60% of your medical costs, I believe, specifically in MA are running through value-based care. I'm wondering how much of that is full risk capitation, how important that is to your strategy there. And maybe relatedly, how important are duals in your MA strategy and moving them into more value-based care? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dave. Just to clarify, it's actually 6% across all lines of business. So that's across commercial Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, so just to clarify that answer. In terms of duals, duals are an important part of our MA growth strategy. We have a very significant impact on duals that aligns both with the Government Business but also what Pete does in the Diversified Business Group and a lot of the investments that we've made, so in myNEXUS home care and Aspire palliative care. Part of what CareMore does is quite extensive in the dual market. So very important part of us. Part of what we do, we think value-based care is critically important to this space. And some of the investments we've made with aggregators will help support our strategy there. In terms of full risk, as we shared at our Investor Day, it's an area that, right now, we're looking to significantly grow and impact over the next several years. So of that 60%, it's mid-teens, I'd say, across our book of business in total, where it continues to grow in terms of full upside downside risk. So not just capitation, but other arrangements that we're also looking to expand. So overall, it's a growing area for us, including with our high-performance network providers. But we think across the board that this is a core to how we get in to trend at CPI plus in our commercial business and to continue to deliver value in our government based business. So thank you very much for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get a little more insight into your expectations on Medicaid enrollment for 2022. Maybe if you could talk about some of the offsets in terms of how much the traction from membership you're assuming just from the resumption of reverifications and any sequencing on the timing of that. And then as a positive offset, if you have an estimate on the amount of members you're going to add from the new Ohio contract in Medicaid, that would be helpful, too. Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thanks, Scott. Appreciate the question, and hopefully, I can give you some detail to help clarify. The timing of the public health emergency clearly is the most significant assumption that needs to be evaluated as part of all this. And right now, the public health emergency is slated to expire April 16. And as a result, we would expect reverifications to begin in the middle of the year. So obviously, if the public health emergency changes and everything else, I'm saying right now needs to be updated simultaneously. But at that point in time, we do expect to see the reverifications. We expect the reverifications to occur over a 12-month period of time through the end of 2022 and the first half of 2023. And we are not expecting a cliff event associated with membership dropping off. At the same time, we expect to capture our fair share of those commercial members, and part of our commercial risk membership growth is predicated on the Medicaid reverifications occurring as I had stated. And so there's certainly a natural hedge or an offset associated with those. The one thing I do want to make sure that everyone is clear about is that there are two states out of our portfolio of Medicaid states that expanded the number of MCOs in their geographies for 2022. And those are states that we have retained our business. However, with additional members -- I'm sorry, additional payers in those, that the states are going to redistribute many of the members. And so there's somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 members that we will lose within those states that we have retained. And that's probably part of the reconciling item that maybe you don't have associated with this. And then as we look at our membership in total, we gave all the components, fee-based, up very nicely individual; MA, double-digit growth; group MA, nice growth with the City of New York; commercial risk, up a couple percent; and then the balance is the loss of members through the Medicaid reverification. So hopefully, all that clarifies your membership questions. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for sneaking me in. My question is on Ingenio and Rx volumes. And we talk a lot about medical utilization. But could you guys talk about if you feel like prescription drug utilization has kind of rebounded off of how I would think about a normalized growth trend line maybe from an unaffected 2019? And kind of what -- can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes if we see a \u2013 a rebound in prescription drug utilization, both in the risk book and in the fee-based book in Ingenio? Thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. So thank you, George, for the question. Really reflecting on what happened in 2020 maybe as a starting point, we have about half of our scripts are maintenance-type scripts. And so certainly, when the pandemic first occurred, we didn't see any impact really, notable impact on that level of script volume. And then, if you recall, we did relax the 90-day rules back then and saw a little bit of a blip in script count, but the overall script volume of the remainder of the scripts was down, and that really corresponded directly to the non-COVID utilization being down as well. And so, now as we fast forward through 2020 -- through 2021 into 2022, script levels are relatively consistent with where we would have thought. Certainly, as I said, half of the scripts are maintenance scripts. Those haven't been impacted at all. And then the other half very much are related to the non-COVID. And the non-COVID utilization was approaching baseline levels near the end of the year before this last Omicron surge. So the script volume really corresponded to that. So hopefully, that clarifies the issues on that.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Thanks. I just wanted to take one layer deeper on the strategy around working with value-based providers. And I'm curious what model seems to be working best. And I think maybe you could delineate commercial versus Medicare, because it sounds like it's across both books of business. And then lastly, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by aggregators. Are those the sort of tech enablers? And should we read into your comments and investments in Privia and Aledade as a preference there? I didn't hear CareMax or any of the center-based investments that you've made.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of value based, I mean, the deepest penetration has historically been in the Medicare Advantage space, given the nature of the product design that we've had, it's been more around very specific networks and the depth. So I think -- the industry has a lot more depth and experience in Medicare Advantage, but we're seeing significant growth in our commercial business across, not just Anthem, but our partnership with our other non-Anthem Blues. So our high-performing network, part of the success that you saw in the significant growth in our national account business was just a significant difference in our value proposition driven by high-performing networks. And again, we've got double-digit improvement in costs versus our competitors there, that has been validated by outside consulting firms. So again, that's one of the reasons we consolidated. We're one of a multi carrier in those accounts. And this year, particularly with our largest, probably most discerning accounts where they could see year-over-year performance, we were able to consolidate to a single carrier. So I'd use those as some proof points around the traction happening in the high-performing markets or high-performing providers. And again, those are particularly -- mostly contracting relationships. When I referenced the two aggregator models, those are examples. We clearly are working with others, but I thought that, that would give you a sense of two of the models that we're working with. We're learning a lot. I guess I'd say it's still early days in many of these relationships. We began them over the last, really, 12 to 18 months. We think that what's important there is an alignment to the goals, the depth of our market share and the opportunity for us to work hand-in-hand in that local market to really the unique needs of that marketplace. Predominantly started in Medicare Advantage, but as you saw from some recent announcements, we're also doing quite a bit of work in commercial, because we see the real opportunity there. And then you look at some of our markets where, Ohio is a great example, we have leading market share in Medicare and commercial, and we'll soon add Medicaid to that. So again, you think across all businesses and supporting those. Many of the early value-based providers were focused on Medicare Advantage. We see that expanding much more broadly to all markets and the skill sets there. So again, I wouldn't read in just the two names that we shared with you. Our preference is to really work with the best of breed in the markets and be able to leverage our scale and deliver something very differentiated because of that unique market. And we're going to continue to evolve that marketplace, and we do believe that the Diversified Business Group can wrap around its services, and that's a way for us to participate in the profit pool, but also bring our services to our members and keep a very consistent consumer experience. So hopefully, that answers your question, and thanks very much for the ability to clarify that. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Hey thanks guys for squeezing me in. Just one, going back to your value-based evolution here. Your competitor United had talked about achieving 8% to 10% margin across the overall across the various cohorts of their capitated membership as they've been scaling rapidly. And I know you guys are taking a very much more capital efficient partnership approach. So how should we think about margins as you scale in value-based and capitated arrangements, maybe as you grow and then also on a run rate basis? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yeah. Thank you for the question. And we do provide some target margins at a line of business level. But we really don't think it's appropriate to go through and talk about target margins at a more granular level than that. The one thing I will say, though, associated with margin expansion is that our Diversified Business Group is going to provide us a great opportunity for margin expansion because, as Pete had talked about serving Anthem members more holistically, more deeply. And the Commercial and the Government Business units will pay Diversified Business Group fair market value for the value that Diversified is providing. And then Pete will continue to make a margin on his services. Certainly, the transaction will eliminate intercompany revenue. Yeah, we'll still have target margins on Commercial and Government, and then we'll have the margins within Pete's area. So we do expect margin expansion over the next five years and really driven by that.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: All right. Thanks. I'll be quick. Just looking at the individual exchange enrollment numbers, they look pretty good, at least at the national level. Is there anything that you've learned as you study these new members? Any underlying characteristics of where they're coming from? Were these commercial? Were they Medicaid? Just what you're thinking as it relates to the risk pool? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Morgan Kendrick will address that. Thank you.\nMorgan Kendrick: Thanks, it's Morgan here. Thanks for the question. Regarding unique characteristics, one thing we've noticed -- I mean we like this business. As you've said, we see it behave and evolve differently by geography. One of the things is there's a stickiness to it that wasn't there originally. And that's something that's been notable of late. As far as where it's coming from, we're typically seeing it come from other exchange members in the market. There are targeted areas where we've made real discerning efforts to get after deep areas that we're underpenetrated in certain geographies that we have, and they're paying dividends for us. So again, one of the things in the beginning of the ACA, it wasn't a sticky market. There was lots of churn every year. We're seeing that very differently now. And we believe the assets we have and the assets we're bringing to the market will indeed pay dividends for us. So we like the market and look forward to continued work there.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Morgan. Now, I'd like to close by saying thank you. It's been a strong year for Anthem, and we greatly appreciate the interest you've shown in our company along the way. I hope today provided some more insight into how we're managing the short-term while building for the long-term. Our results show we're on our front foot and we're optimistic about the future. We're clear on our commitment to make whole health reality. And as we go forward, you can expect our focus on being a lifetime trusted partner in health to be consistent. Our work is a privilege and a responsibility of all 98,000 of us in Anthem, and we take it personally every day, and we'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to make a valuable difference for all of those, who we are so privileged to serve. Thank you, everyone. Have a great week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11 a.m. today through February 25, 2022, you may access the replay system at any time by dialing 800-570-8796, and international participants can dial 203-369-3290.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Gail, and thanks, A.J. Appreciate it. I continue to be really energized about the opportunity. As Gail said, serving the complex and the chronically ill really aligns well with our core business and where we're seeing the trends go in our core business. I'd say of paramount importance is the opportunity to penetrate Anthem more as it relates to our core existing offerings, a tremendous opportunity to expand our product portfolio and offer new products for these complex populations. I'd say we're very focused on, at least I am and the team in the short term, on how a lot of these solutions stitch together and extend to create further value. For example, if you think about myNEXUS, which, as Gail said in her prepared comments is performing really well, its connection to the home, it allows us to consider a lot of extension product opportunities. So when you think about that more specifically, the post-acute care opportunity, and we're actually going to be launching some new post-acute care product offerings this upcoming year. When you think about managing durable medical equipment and the opportunity there. And then importantly, as we've talked about for the last several quarters, the importance of social drivers of health and how much is occurring in the home, so that's one area that we are very interested in. And then again, how you weave IngenioRx into this also plays a critical role in terms of specialty pharmacy and potentially home infusion, et cetera. And I think the other really important point, as we put these product offerings together and stitch them together, it creates tremendous proof points as it relates to our opportunities externally. With the Blues and our Blue partners, we currently have 26 Blue clients. I think there's tremendous opportunity to improve that. And then importantly, with those Blue clients, we have 10 with multiple solutions. So I look forward to the opportunity to create value in Anthem and then extend that externally as well."

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share Anthem once again delivered solid operating results in the fourth quarter, capping off another year of outstanding growth, as we transform with focus and discipline from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. I'll start by sharing performance highlights for the quarter and the year and follow with some key actions and investments that drove our growth and laid the groundwork for what we expect will be another year of strong operating performance in 2022. In the fourth quarter, Anthem delivered GAAP earnings per share of $4.63 and adjusted earnings per share of $5.14 ahead of expectations and against the backdrop of COVID-19. For the full year, Anthem reported GAAP earnings per share of $24.73 and adjusted earnings per share of $25.98, reflecting a 16% increase year-over-year. During 2021, our investments in enhancing the customer experience, delivering innovative, customized whole health solutions and deepening digital engagement helped to deliver strong growth across our health benefits businesses, all while rapidly scaling our diversified health services solutions. We ended the year with 45.4 million members, up 2.4 million or 6% year-over-year, with approximately 3/4 of those gains coming from organic growth. In our Commercial business, improved selling strategies and innovative customized product offerings sustained our momentum and led to the best ever selling season for our national accounts team. In addition, traction is accelerating as we address clients' unique needs in targeted subsegments such as balanced funding for midsized employers and customized plans and digital tools for college students. The flexible architecture of our Sydney Health mobile app enables seamless integration into clients' ecosystems, while helping deepen digital engagement with members in this fast-growing market. As a result, we anticipate delivering another year of growth in our Group and Individual businesses in 2022. For many employers, our focus on affordability and integrated whole health solutions is prompting consolidation with Anthem, eliminating other medical carriers and integrating pharmacy management. Consequently, IngenioRx saw significant growth in net new sales to start 2022, keeping us on track with our goal of narrowing the profitability gap of risk-based and fee-based Commercial customers. Moving to Medicare Advantage, our continuing work to strengthen Anthem's value proposition helped drive another strong annual election period. Customers want their benefits to meet their needs today and in the future, and packages like our everyday extras that offer holistic services such as transportation, personal home health, and healthy pre-prepared meal delivery are resonating because they provide the flexibility to choose what matters most to each individual. Offering flexible and personalized benefits will remain a key part of our approach in individual MA and we expect ongoing enhancements to power another year of double-digit growth in 2022. We also expect a substantial membership increase in group Medicare Advantage when our contracts serving the retirees of the City of New York begins on April 1st. This timing is consistent with the recent court ruling that upheld our contract and extended the open enrollment period for an additional three months. In Medicaid, our team did an outstanding job in 2021 demonstrating the differentiated value we offer states built on our deep understanding of the needs of their communities. Our rich legacy of investing in community health uniquely positions us to address health disparities with solutions that extend beyond clinical care to improve health outcomes. Our 100% RFP win rate included renewals of our statewide contracts in Tennessee and Indiana and a new statewide contract in Ohio, which will help further deepen our roots in that state given our leading market share positions in commercial and Medicare Advantage. Then as we begin serving Ohio in July, our pending acquisition of Paramount Advantage's Ohio Medicaid contract will amplify our Medicaid footprint. This investment follows our pending acquisition of Integra, a New York managed long-term care plan that will strengthen our presence and capabilities in the greater New York City area. These examples demonstrate our commitment to strategic and programmatic M&A. And we've become more agile and proactive as we target health plans that deepen our existing benefits business and acquisitions, which diversify and expand our addressable markets. A good example is our myNEXUS acquisition, which enables members to live healthier lives in their homes. myNEXUS has performed well to-date, driven partly by its expanding scope within Anthem. In addition, we expect the ongoing aging of the population and consumer preference for at-home care to propel growth for years to come. Over the last year, we significantly advanced our care provider strategy with investments in risk bearing primary care providers and aggregators, while enhancing value-based arrangements across our network. These arrangements accounted for more than 60% of our medical expense last year. We expect this strategy to accelerate membership growth, increase star ratings and improve health outcomes and cost of care. Investing in providers and aggregators secures joint governance to maintain alignment of shared interest with our partners, giving Anthem value from sharing risk and elevating the customer and provider experience. Importantly, this strategy ensures Anthem is not overly reliant on one care model as value-based care matures. Our diversified business group will increasingly benefit from these arrangements by opportunities to service Anthem's providers with enablement programs and other diversified services, many of which target the needs of complex and chronic patient populations where we see significant opportunities to improve outcomes, access and total cost of care. We expect to remain flexible and thoughtful in our provider strategy, partnering in most markets and investing in care delivery and others where it makes sense. We also made meaningful headway in our digital transformation during the quarter with accelerated investments to deepen digital engagement and meet the increasing need for convenience and personalized care. During our peak onboarding period earlier this month, digital registrations rose 150%, and visits to Sydney Health grew 142%. Capabilities and investments in artificial intelligence, which power our personalization engine are helping optimize the customer experience and reduce low-value administrative tasks. For example, our virtual primary care platform builds real-world learnings on commercial members' usage patterns and preferences to anticipate customer needs and offer customized experiences, and automating the on-boarding process delivers better experiences by saving time and improving the accuracy of critical data and the quality of virtual visits. To illustrate, more than 1,000 emergency room visits were avoided last month by predicting and addressing adverse health events through our virtual care options. Results like this are encouraging, and we're excited to accelerate the pace. Anthem enters 2022 with strong growth momentum across all of our businesses. This gives us confidence in our ability to deliver growth in adjusted earnings per share consistent with our long-term target range of 12% to 15%, as John will discuss more in a moment. Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue investing in profitable growth, innovating for consumers and advancing our digital platform for health as we work to achieve our purpose of improving the health of humanity. As part of our community health and sustainability commitments, I'm pleased to share, we recently met our 100% renewable electricity goal four years ahead of schedule and are now producing enough clean energy via off-site purchase agreements to power all of the Anthem's offices, data centers and clinics. It's gratifying to see our efforts earn Anthem a place on the 2021 Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year and on JUST Capital's 2022 rankings of America's most just companies. We're also in the early stages of leveraging insights derived from a dynamic model, tracking the health of our communities across local, social and clinical drivers. We call it our whole health index, and we believe it will help us more closely assess our progress towards helping people live healthier lives. In its simplest form, the index will help us identify the most promising opportunities to improve the health of our members and their communities. To date, we've leveraged the index to design and launch programs to manage obesity in five of our Medicaid states, where this health issue is especially severe. We're currently learning from field tests and are excited about the possibilities ahead, notably in diabetes prevention and customized wellness campaigns for employers based on the needs of their employees. As part of our ongoing work to support our customers' health, we also began offering risk-based Commercial members free at-home COVID tests through our Sydney app starting last November, Delivered within one to two business days, the kits allow members to test safely without leaving the comfort of their homes. This program has positioned us well to comply with the administration's recent requirement to provide home testing at no cost. In closing, I'll leave you with these three takeaways. Anthem's fiscal year 2021 performance demonstrates our strategy to become a lifetime trusted partner in health is helping unlock Anthem's full potential. With our plans and continued investments for fiscal year 2022, we are excited about our ability to sustain this momentum and deliver growth in the years ahead. And our strategic approach to innovation and digital transformation enables us to move even faster and with greater agility as we accelerate our digital platform for health and offer new ways to attract, engage and retain more customers while streamlining our business and simplifying the consumer experience. Now I'd like to welcome John to add his view on the quarter and our outlook for 2022. John? Thanks for the question, Steve. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government Business, to respond. Thanks for the question, Steve. And I'll just sort of summarize what Felicia said. I mean I think we felt we had a very strong AEP. We're expecting double-digit growth and very consistent from our perspective around the competitive market as well as the distribution channels. So thanks for the question. And next question, please. Well, thank you, Justin. There were a number of questions there, so we'll try to address. Let me first take the first one around Medicare Advantage. Overall, I think very consistent competitive environment. When you talk about churn specifically, we're not seeing anything significantly different than we've seen in the past. It's been a competitive market. It remains a competitive market. As I shared, we feel that our supplemental benefits and the things that we do to help support Medicare beneficiaries has been very positive. And also, we spent a lot of time on ensuring that through our marketing and other things that our members understand the components of our benefits and have a good welcome experience with us. But again, we see that as pretty consistent. I'm going to ask John to address the questions that you had more specifically around trend. Thank you. Next question please. Thanks for the question, John. And I guess I would reiterate, as John said, there are a number of moving parts to this, but we feel that we've taken those into consideration and wanted to share our thoughts on certainly the first half of the year but feel confident in the way we've managed through it in 2021 and heading into 2022. Next question please. Well, thanks for the question, A.J. And I will turn this over to Pete Haytaian to share his perspective, but I think there's a few things, going back to my remarks. One, clearly, a huge opportunity for us in IngenioRx as well, and we shared how well that business is performing and the opportunity that we have to continue to embed the Ingenio as part of our whole health solutions into particularly mid-market accounts, and we've done a nice job there. And then in terms of the Diversified Business group, again, serving our complex and chronic patients has been an area of focus for a number of years, and we're seeing acceleration in that. So I'll ask Pete to give some specific points about where he sees that growth coming from. Yes. Thank you, Pete. And I think you heard from Pete, there's really two huge opportunities for us for accelerating growth. One, deeper penetration inside of Anthem, and we're beginning to bring all of these products together in a much more integrated way; and two, the opportunity through our provider strategy, our aggregator strategy to use our diversified business assets to participate in the profit pools in that area. So those are two, we think, growth opportunities for us in the future. And again, it's early days, but we're seeing some really nice progress in these early days. Thanks for the question. Next one, please. Thank you. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick, who leads that business, to provide some commentary. Next question, please. Next question, please. Thanks for the question. Just to clarify a little bit, when we talk about the profitability between fully insured and our self-insured business or risk versus fee, we're really talking about adding more services to the fee-based business. So I wasn't sure if I understood your question correctly, but we are making great progress on that. We had predicted that we would end the year on 4:1, which we did. And we're seeing, as I mentioned in my opening comments, the opportunity to add IngenioRx plus clinical services, advocacy. So there's a whole number of areas that have begun to gain traction in that. So we feel very much on target, feel good about it. If you think about just our fee-based revenue in the fourth quarter increase 12% compared to a year ago, when revenue increased over -- and for the year increased over 7%, so this growth came despite somewhat flattish membership growth. I think that really punctuates the impact of the various buy-up programs that we had. So, again, overall, I feel like we're making really good progress on that. Your question about the 2% plus risk-based membership growth, we feel that, that's a prudent projection going into the year. We had very strong growth in 2020, but feel good about where we are positioned. There was a previous question about our individual membership. Again, we have taken, I think, a very steady and consistent approach to the individual market. We did that again this year. So we don't look for outsized growth in any one of those markets, but consistent growth across our risk base and in the 14 states where we do business. So, again, feel good about it, making progress around all of those. And, again, we are making progress on that profit targetability. Thank you. Next question. Well, Lance, thank you very much for the series of questions, and let me try to kind of go through each of them and give you a bit of a perspective. As I shared in my opening remarks, I think we've been very consistent actually in our care provider and our value-based strategy over the years. Specifically, your question comes to what it relates to primary care, I think we've always taken a very thoughtful approach to how we leverage our scale in the market because we do believe that's one of the critical criteria for success. Recently, we shared and have updated everyone on some of the partnerships. Our model primarily has been a partnership model. So our investments, for example, in Privia and Adalat are the two that I think you're referring to, but there have been others that we've also shared. When you talk about taking an ownership position, again, that's something we have done in the past. So it's not -- I know often we get the question of why we don't do it. We have done it actually and where it makes sense in our local markets and based on the depth and the dynamics. And good examples, very early on with CareMore but also HealthSun simply, most recently last year when we bought MMM. So we're not against owning care delivery, but we do think in areas where we want to own it would be where we can accelerate our membership growth. And predominantly in areas where complex and chronic patients, we can improve the impact we have there, obviously, increase our Star ratings and improve the health outcomes and by partnering is one of the important parts in our aggregators. I want to take a minute on the aggregator strategy and why we're investing in some of these because they also allow us to stand up joint governance structures. And my prior answer, we talked a little bit about making sure that we remain aligned with our care provider partners. So that's a great way for us to participate in the governance structure and be aligned with our care providers and be very direct about our partnership preference where we can do it. So as you think about these partnerships, they also benefit our Diversified Business Group. Again, going back to my last answer, we see an opportunity to wrap around different provider enablement programs. Also some of the acquisitions we've done recently are good examples of where we can do pull-through, and we can participate in the profit pool in a broader way, so very consistent with that. They're very capital-efficient for us. And again, our focus is very much on complex and chronic, and we see significant opportunities. So I guess I would conclude our strategy is different than our others, and we see that as unique because of the set of assets that we have are very unique, and we want to leverage that depth and, again, that partnership that we've built. It also allows us to derive value from sharing risk and ensuring that we're not reliant on any single model. As we know, this value-based space continues to evolve and mature. We don't think that one model is going to work in every market. We fundamentally believe that care is delivered locally and that's the core to who we are and how we've grown up as a company. And so we see each model as unique, but we do think that there's an opportunity for scale and to wrap around, particularly our DBG assets, and to drive differentiated outcome. In terms of your last question, we do share a lot of these models with our partner, Blues, particularly in states where we have JVs already. So yeah, we do think there's opportunities for us to take a leadership role there and work closely. Other Blues have great ideas, and we also learned from them. So we think this is an opportunity where the market is going to change quite a bit, and we're going to keep optionality and be very capital efficient but also drive through, I think, a differentiated cost structure, and that's kind of where we start today. So thank you very much for the question, and next question please. Thank you. Next question, please. Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. As you can appreciate, we won't go into details on specific markets and really won't comment on one area in particular. Overall, our small group market, we feel really good about, particularly the alternative and submarket strategy that we've launched over the last several years and have continued to make gains in it. So our products are resonating there quite well. We added a virtual-only product this year. That's having -- gaining a lot of traction but, again, won't speak to specific markets. Thanks for the question. Next question. Yes. Thanks for the second question, Ricky. In terms of the BCBSA litigation, just to clarify, as you know, the final approval hearing was held in October of 2021, and that court took the matter under advisement, which is typical for cases of this size and scale. And so, some of the account members have submitted objections, which they're working through right now, and that's not unusual, so it's pretty typical for a case of the size. So in terms of projecting what this all means, et cetera. As John said, we expect to pay the settlement in 2022 versus what we had previously projected in 2021. We fully accrued for that. In terms of the overall market, I think it's too early to say. I mean we've always worked inside of the Blue system with our peer plans. We have a number of seeds, and so I really don't have a comment on that until we get through the overall process. But, again, I feel that, that will get resolved in 2022. Thank you. Next question. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. In terms of home testing, I think, it is a good opportunity to provide a little clarity on just how we're thinking about it. First of all, let me point out, and I know everyone is quite aware of this, that we're already paying for a significant volume of testing, mostly inside of medical facilities. And generally, these tend to be eight to 10 times the price of the at-home test. In addition, you add on the office fee. So while it's difficult to know the exact degree, to which the home testing or testing will go up as a result of the role, we do expect some substitution with lower cost home test displacing some of those tests that are currently done in the medical facilities. It's also, as you heard in my opening remarks, we proactively began offering free home COVID test to our risk-based commercial members through Sydney Health in November. And those tests right now are delivered to our members' homes within one to two business days and our early experience indicates that individuals are ordering these based on their need and there's been appropriate usage. In respect to our guidance, we did consider the effect of the substitution, the availability of the four free tests per household that the federal government is supplying, current short-term supply constraints and the likelihood of spikes in demand in the year that would drive potential surges in the COVID case rate. So those tended to go inside, as you know, with the lower non-COVID utilization. So that should be a natural offset, as John has shared earlier in the call. So bottom line, there's pretty wide range or there is a wide range of outcomes around the world, but we believe that our guidance provided that this morning captures the most likely net impact in our financial results. And that's one reason why our cost structure is expected to be at/or above baseline in the four quarters of 2022. So overall, we feel we've used our analytics to do our best assessment. And again, we do have some experience with the test through our Sydney app. So thanks very much for allowing us to clarify how we're thinking about that. Next question please. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Dave. Just to clarify, it's actually 6% across all lines of business. So that's across commercial Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, so just to clarify that answer. In terms of duals, duals are an important part of our MA growth strategy. We have a very significant impact on duals that aligns both with the Government Business but also what Pete does in the Diversified Business Group and a lot of the investments that we've made, so in myNEXUS home care and Aspire palliative care. Part of what CareMore does is quite extensive in the dual market. So very important part of us. Part of what we do, we think value-based care is critically important to this space. And some of the investments we've made with aggregators will help support our strategy there. In terms of full risk, as we shared at our Investor Day, it's an area that, right now, we're looking to significantly grow and impact over the next several years. So of that 60%, it's mid-teens, I'd say, across our book of business in total, where it continues to grow in terms of full upside downside risk. So not just capitation, but other arrangements that we're also looking to expand. So overall, it's a growing area for us, including with our high-performance network providers. But we think across the board that this is a core to how we get in to trend at CPI plus in our commercial business and to continue to deliver value in our government based business. So thank you very much for the question. Next question please. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question please. Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of value based, I mean, the deepest penetration has historically been in the Medicare Advantage space, given the nature of the product design that we've had, it's been more around very specific networks and the depth. So I think -- the industry has a lot more depth and experience in Medicare Advantage, but we're seeing significant growth in our commercial business across, not just Anthem, but our partnership with our other non-Anthem Blues. So our high-performing network, part of the success that you saw in the significant growth in our national account business was just a significant difference in our value proposition driven by high-performing networks. And again, we've got double-digit improvement in costs versus our competitors there, that has been validated by outside consulting firms. So again, that's one of the reasons we consolidated. We're one of a multi carrier in those accounts. And this year, particularly with our largest, probably most discerning accounts where they could see year-over-year performance, we were able to consolidate to a single carrier. So I'd use those as some proof points around the traction happening in the high-performing markets or high-performing providers. And again, those are particularly -- mostly contracting relationships. When I referenced the two aggregator models, those are examples. We clearly are working with others, but I thought that, that would give you a sense of two of the models that we're working with. We're learning a lot. I guess I'd say it's still early days in many of these relationships. We began them over the last, really, 12 to 18 months. We think that what's important there is an alignment to the goals, the depth of our market share and the opportunity for us to work hand-in-hand in that local market to really the unique needs of that marketplace. Predominantly started in Medicare Advantage, but as you saw from some recent announcements, we're also doing quite a bit of work in commercial, because we see the real opportunity there. And then you look at some of our markets where, Ohio is a great example, we have leading market share in Medicare and commercial, and we'll soon add Medicaid to that. So again, you think across all businesses and supporting those. Many of the early value-based providers were focused on Medicare Advantage. We see that expanding much more broadly to all markets and the skill sets there. So again, I wouldn't read in just the two names that we shared with you. Our preference is to really work with the best of breed in the markets and be able to leverage our scale and deliver something very differentiated because of that unique market. And we're going to continue to evolve that marketplace, and we do believe that the Diversified Business Group can wrap around its services, and that's a way for us to participate in the profit pool, but also bring our services to our members and keep a very consistent consumer experience. So hopefully, that answers your question, and thanks very much for the ability to clarify that. Next question please. Thank you. Next question please. Morgan Kendrick will address that. Thank you. Thank you, Morgan. Now, I'd like to close by saying thank you. It's been a strong year for Anthem, and we greatly appreciate the interest you've shown in our company along the way. I hope today provided some more insight into how we're managing the short-term while building for the long-term. Our results show we're on our front foot and we're optimistic about the future. We're clear on our commitment to make whole health reality. And as we go forward, you can expect our focus on being a lifetime trusted partner in health to be consistent. Our work is a privilege and a responsibility of all 98,000 of us in Anthem, and we take it personally every day, and we'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to make a valuable difference for all of those, who we are so privileged to serve. Thank you, everyone. Have a great week."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "So good morning, Steven. Thank you for that question. First and foremost, let me say that we are very pleased with our overall performance during this past AEP, and we're on track for another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage business. When we think about distribution, we meet our members where they want to be met from a sales perspective, and that means providing them with a range of distribution options. The EMO channel represents an important and valuable distribution partner for us. We saw an acceleration in this channel prior to the pandemic, and we've long recognized the value that they bring in educating consumers about Medicare options and, equally important, the differentiated value that Anthem provides. This AEP for us wasn't meaningfully different in terms of our distribution mix, and we are going to continue to provide a distribution mix that represents being able to meet our consumers at the full end of the spectrum. We believe in the strong value of MA. It's a very solid business, and we really provide a strong value proposition for consumers. So we continue to evaluate all the time our mix, but we feel good about where we're positioned today with our distribution mix."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail stated, we are pleased to have delivered solid fourth quarter financial results, closing out another year of strong growth, driven by the continued execution of our long-term strategy, all while navigating the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic. Fourth quarter earnings per share of $5.14 was ahead of our expectations and drove full year adjusted earnings per share to $25.98 reflecting growth of approximately 16% year-over-year, above our long-term 12% to 15% annual earnings per share growth target. Total operating revenue for the fourth quarter was $36 billion, an increase of more than 14% over the prior year quarter, reflecting solid growth in our benefits business, coupled with continued momentum in our services businesses. We closed the year with 45.4 million members growth of nearly 6% or 2.4 million members in the year, including 303,000 lives added just during the fourth quarter and with growth in both our Government and Commercial businesses. This was the 14th consecutive quarter in which we grew total medical membership, underscoring the strength and resilience of our core benefits businesses through periods of economic strength and periods of economic uncertainty. In 2021, we grew our government membership over 17% driven by organic growth in Medicaid, another year of double-digit organic growth in Medicare Advantage and the acquisition of MMM. Commercial enrollment grew modestly as solid growth in our risk-based areas were partially offset by in-group attrition in our fee-based business due to broader labor market dynamics that occurred during the year. Our fourth quarter benefit expense ratio was 89.5%, an increase of 60 basis points over the prior year quarter, driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. As expected, total medical costs in the quarter were above normal or baseline levels but still compared favorably to our expectations driven by lower utilization of non-COVID care partially offset by higher-than-expected COVID-related costs, notably in December. Anthem's SG&A ratio in the fourth quarter was 11.7% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 200 basis points over the prior year quarter. Excluding adjustment items noted in our press release, our adjusted SG&A ratio would have been 11.1% down approximately 250 basis points year-over-year. The decrease was driven by the repeal of the health insurer tax and the expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by increased investments to support our growth and digital transformation efforts afforded by outperformance in our investment income. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $1.7 billion, bringing full year 2021 operating cash flow to $8.4 billion or 1.4x net income. Our fourth quarter and full year cash generation beat our expectations, reflecting strong operating performance this year, as well as a shift in the timing of the planned payment of our share of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement. We now expect to make this payment of approximately $500 million in 2022, which is included in the guidance we provided this morning for operating cash flow of greater than $6.9 billion. We ended 2021 with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, in line with our expectations and well within our targeted range. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable ended the year at 45.2 days, an increase of 1.8 days year-over-year, with medical claims payable up 19% year-over-year compared to premium revenue increasing by 13%. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our stock at a weighted average price of $417.92. For the year, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for $1.9 billion, ahead of our original guidance of $1.6 billion. We were opportunistic in the year, capitalizing on periods of market volatility, notably during the fourth quarter. Turning to our outlook for 2022. We are pleased to provide initial guidance, including adjusted earnings per share of greater than $28.25, which reflects growth of at least 12% from the normalized adjusted earnings per share baseline of $25.20 in 2021. As a reminder, we benefited from significant investment income outperformance during the year, including amounts that we believe to be non-recurring. We offset a portion of the upside in the fourth quarter by accelerating investments in our business. In total for the year, we believe nearly $0.80 of our adjusted earnings per share to be outside of our run rate. Accordingly, we continue to view $25.20 as the appropriate starting point for our growth in 2022. We expect to end 2022 with total medical membership in the range of 45.6 million to 46.2 million members. This outlook includes the expectation of generating double-digit organic growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage business and the launch of our group Medicare Advantage contract serving the retirees of the City of New York in April, to add at least 200,000 group Medicare Advantage lives, while shifting a like number of members out of our commercial fee-based enrollment, given that we currently serve the city's retirees on a self-insured basis. In all, Medicare Advantage membership is expected to grow in the mid-teens percentage range. Our outlook also reflects strong growth in our Commercial risk and fee-based businesses, including a strong starting point due to a record selling season for national accounts. We expect commercial fee-based membership to grow by 2% to 3% or 530,000 to 730,000 members net after covering the transition of our more than 200,000 existing fee-based members in New York into our new group Medicare Advantage contract and low single-digit growth in our commercial risk-based members. With respect to Medicaid, our guidance assumes that public health emergency will end in mid-April as is currently planned with Medicaid eligibility redeterminations resuming around the middle of the year. Correspondingly, we expect to capture our commensurate share of growth in commercial fee and risk-based markets as consumers losing Medicaid benefits migrate to employer-sponsored coverage and individual plans. As you might expect, our membership outlook for our Commercial and Medicaid business is highly dependent on the timing and pace of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations. The launch of our new statewide Medicaid contract serving Ohio in July is also contemplated in our guidance range, while membership associated with pending acquisitions is not. We expect continued momentum in our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx segments with revenue growth on a combined basis in the low to mid-teens. Altogether, the momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses will drive operating revenue up 11% year-over-year to approximately $152 billion. This includes approximately $130 billion of premium revenue, also up 11% over 2021, representing an increase of nearly $13 billion. The consolidated benefit expense ratio is expected to be 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in 2022, consistent with our initial outlook for 2021. At the midpoint, this reflects a 50 basis point increase year-over-year driven primarily by the launch of our New York Group Medicare Advantage contract. With respect to the impacts of COVID on our overall cost structure, we anticipate another year in which the overall cost of care will track above normalized levels driven by COVID-related treatment, vaccination, and testing costs. We expect the SG&A expense ratio to be 10.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in 2022, reflecting a reduction of 60 basis points at the midpoint of the range relative to our adjusted SG&A ratio in 2021. The reduction was primarily driven by operating expense leverage due to strong growth in revenue, in addition to the benefits of our ongoing modernization efforts, including workflow automation and digitization. This is partially offset by continued investment in our initiatives that will drive future growth and the operating efficiencies, including digital engagement and system migrations. We expect our operating gain for the year to be greater than $8.4 billion reflecting growth of at least 8% year-over-year over adjusted operating earnings in 2021. Below the line, investment income is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion and interest expense is expected to be approximately $840 million. Our effective income tax rate for the year is expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%, consistent with 2021. Full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $6.9 billion, which includes the anticipated payment of our share of the BCBSA litigation settlement, which, as I noted earlier is approximately $500 million. From a capital deployment perspective, our long-term targets remain unchanged, and we will continue to pursue programmatic M&A in an effort to enhance the organic growth of our existing operations and diversify and extend our capabilities, moving us closely to our goal of becoming a lifetime trusted partner in health. While our guidance does not include any benefit from future or pending M&A, it does contemplate a 4% to 5% contribution to growth in adjusted earnings per share associated with capital deployment, including M&A completed in 2021, notably MMM and myNEXUS, and anticipated share repurchases of at least $1.5 billion in 2022 that we expect will drive our weighted average share count into the range of 243 million to 244 million shares outstanding for the full year. With respect to seasonality, we are projecting profitability patterns close to our historical ranges and expect to earn approximately 55% of our income in the first half of the year, although earnings in the first and second quarter will be split roughly evenly. Our guidance assumes that our benefit expense ratio will approximate the midpoint of our full year range in the first quarter, which we believe will be a prudent assumption in light of the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I am also pleased to announce that our Board recently authorized and increased our quarterly dividend of more than 13% to $1.28 per share, continuing our track record of increasing our dividend every year since we began paying dividends in 2011. Our new dividend annualizes to $5.12 per share, a yield of approximately 1.2% based on our current share price. In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another year of strong growth despite significant challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. While much of the backdrop remains uncertain, we are committed to managing the uncertainty thoughtfully and prudently. We look forward to making further progress against our strategy and delivering on our financial commitments once again in 2022. Operator, we will now open it up for questions. Yes. Thank you, Justin, for the questions. In terms of trends by lines of business, and as I had stated in the prepared comments, overall, total COVID was higher than anticipated, but non-COVID more than offset it. And so our total cost structure, while above baseline, was better than our expectations. Commercial had the highest cost compared to baseline. You look at what happened in the fourth quarter. Children were eligible for vaccines for the first time. You had the Omicron surge, et cetera. Medicare was next in line with overall cost structure of adding COVID and non-COVID combined to be slightly above baseline. And Medicaid overall, actually ended the quarter slightly below baseline. But all in, the total is what I said. As you look to 2022, there's consistent themes, and we're not going to go into specific trends by line of businesses. But, overall, we expect Commercial to have the highest amount of cost compared to baseline of the three lines of business for the year and Medicare to be second and Medicaid to be third. So very consistent 2022 expectations versus fourth quarter actuals. So thank you for the question. Yes. Good morning, Nathan, and thank you for the question. And maybe I'll address earnings seasonality and MLR seasonality somewhat consistently, because they obviously drive each other. You look at the seasonality of earnings patterns that we've had historically as a company, we've had 55%, 60%, closer to 60% of our money we make in the first six months of the year pre-pandemic. That obviously has shifted the last couple of years and which are really not the best benchmarks to use now for analysis purposes. And now we look at what we expect this year. We expect closer to 55% of our money to be earned in the first half. And then we expect the first and second quarter to be relatively consistent with each other. First quarter MLR, as you pointed out, will be a bit higher than historical patterns. A few key reasons for that. We ended 2021 going into 2022 with an Omicron surge. That was impacting our Commercial business, maybe a bit more than other lines, consistent with how I just answered Justin's question. There's a spike in hospitalizations that we're going through. We do expect non-COVID to drop, but the quarterly timing maybe isn't quite as clear. One other comment just to make -- to help clarify maybe a change in seasonality patterns is, we're within the public health emergency right now. And the public health emergency has many, many provisions associated with it. One of those is that any COVID diagnostic testing or cost structure, we need to waive co-pays and deductibles. And so, if you think about our historic seasonality patterns and the historic fact that, at the beginning of the year, that co-pays and deductibles are a significant part of the leverage between quarters, you don't have that to quite the same level during a public health emergency. And while those co-pays and deductibles are still in effect for the full year, they do not apply to COVID-type cost structures, and so we have a shift of cost between quarters. And then in the second quarter, we do expect COVID to be a little bit less severe than it is in the first quarter, and so that will impact our MLR positively. But we also launched the City of New York Group Retiree business and that excellent contract that we won. And so that will put upward pressure on the MLR in the second quarter. So all-in, we think we're in pretty good shape, and we want to be very prudent in terms of how we're assessing the COVID, the pandemic and our guidance. Thank you. Sure. Thank you, Lisa, for the questions. I'll see if I can unpack them all with this answer. But in terms of access to the health care system, over the past year, we really have not seen anyone that has been denied access to needed -- necessary care. And so while there may have been some puts and takes and some pent-up demand in the past, we think the vast, vast majority of that has all passed. And while that does happen on a temporary basis during some of these surges, the system is able to accommodate. So -- and the other thing I think is very clear that we've seen is that whenever there is a COVID surge, that there has historically now been a non-COVID drop that is a natural hedge against it. In terms of the just the cost trend in general and other variants, I certainly don't want to predict what the next variant's going to look like or even what letter of the Greek alphabet it's going to be named after. But on the other hand, as we look at Omicron, Omicron is clearly less severe on a per-member basis, but far more contagious. So you look at really the number of people who are infected by it, it's more multiplicatively higher than the number of people that were infected by Delta or the original COVID, and then the hospitalization rates are then a fraction. But you look at it sort of on a year-over-year basis, the hospitalization rates are relatively consistent in total and maybe even up a little bit for Omicron. So it's really hard to say exactly what the next variant is going to look like, but we model these things. We try to be very thoughtful and even prudent and conservative in the way that we've modeled it. And I think you can see our 2021 performance has shown that we are a bit conservative in the way that we assess these things, and we're going to continue that same thought process for 2022. So thank you for the question. Gary, thank you for the question, and I really do appreciate the opportunity to provide clarity because it's actually an excellent question that you've asked. The increase in MLR is essentially entirely driven by mix. So we have the state of New York -- or I'm sorry, the City of New York, Medicare Advantage contract that goes live. It's going to be in excess of 200,000 members launching April 1. That will increase the overall MLR of the company. We have just general growth in various other areas. We acquired MMM mid-year 2021. We will have a full year of MMM in 2022. The overall aspect of that is that the weighted average MLR for the entire company goes up. We'd go live with Ohio mid-year as well in our new Medicaid win. So when you -- our Medicare Advantage on an individual basis is growing by double-digits, really outpacing every other line of business we have in the company, and the average MLR associated with those new members increases the MLR of the company. So the core underlying MLRs associated with each of the lines of business, the forward pricing aspects of including COVID, we feel very good about and feel very solid about. But the analysis of the 50 basis point increase, it's entirely mix. So thank you for the opportunity to provide that clarification. Thank you, Ricky. I'll answer your first question on the cost of care, and then maybe I think Gail wants to make a couple of comments on the Blue settlement. But associated with the cost of care, I did not say that we would be above normal trend. I said that the cost structure would be above baseline. So I just want to make sure that the nuance of those words is very clear to everyone on the line. In terms of how that compares the COVID headwind and the $600 million, I'll just say COVID headwinds, there's many different things associated with them. Certainly, there's treatment cost, vaccine administration and testing that all go through cost of care. Our COVID headwinds, though, encompassed everything associated with COVID that might include things like the impact on risk adjustment revenue, not necessarily cost of care but clearly an item that's going to impact revenue and impact the bottom line. And then offsets, it will include drop in non-COVID utilization, pricing actions and various other aspects. And those are just examples of a very, very long list. And so in 2021, we did estimate that about $600 million of net headwinds, and while each bucket maybe didn't come out exactly how we had predicted, the overall estimate was reasonable. And so you look into 2022, our net headwind is smaller. For instance, risk adjustment revenue should be improved compared to 2021 as you look at the amount of utilization that occurred in the Medicare Advantage in 2020 versus 2021, we should have better risk scores. But additionally, we've continued our pricing discipline. So anyway, so thank you for the question. I just want to make sure that we are clear on exactly what the headwind related to and the size of it. Gail? Yes. Thanks, Scott. Appreciate the question, and hopefully, I can give you some detail to help clarify. The timing of the public health emergency clearly is the most significant assumption that needs to be evaluated as part of all this. And right now, the public health emergency is slated to expire April 16. And as a result, we would expect reverifications to begin in the middle of the year. So obviously, if the public health emergency changes and everything else, I'm saying right now needs to be updated simultaneously. But at that point in time, we do expect to see the reverifications. We expect the reverifications to occur over a 12-month period of time through the end of 2022 and the first half of 2023. And we are not expecting a cliff event associated with membership dropping off. At the same time, we expect to capture our fair share of those commercial members, and part of our commercial risk membership growth is predicated on the Medicaid reverifications occurring as I had stated. And so there's certainly a natural hedge or an offset associated with those. The one thing I do want to make sure that everyone is clear about is that there are two states out of our portfolio of Medicaid states that expanded the number of MCOs in their geographies for 2022. And those are states that we have retained our business. However, with additional members -- I'm sorry, additional payers in those, that the states are going to redistribute many of the members. And so there's somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 members that we will lose within those states that we have retained. And that's probably part of the reconciling item that maybe you don't have associated with this. And then as we look at our membership in total, we gave all the components, fee-based, up very nicely individual; MA, double-digit growth; group MA, nice growth with the City of New York; commercial risk, up a couple percent; and then the balance is the loss of members through the Medicaid reverification. So hopefully, all that clarifies your membership questions. Thank you. Yes. So thank you, George, for the question. Really reflecting on what happened in 2020 maybe as a starting point, we have about half of our scripts are maintenance-type scripts. And so certainly, when the pandemic first occurred, we didn't see any impact really, notable impact on that level of script volume. And then, if you recall, we did relax the 90-day rules back then and saw a little bit of a blip in script count, but the overall script volume of the remainder of the scripts was down, and that really corresponded directly to the non-COVID utilization being down as well. And so, now as we fast forward through 2020 -- through 2021 into 2022, script levels are relatively consistent with where we would have thought. Certainly, as I said, half of the scripts are maintenance scripts. Those haven't been impacted at all. And then the other half very much are related to the non-COVID. And the non-COVID utilization was approaching baseline levels near the end of the year before this last Omicron surge. So the script volume really corresponded to that. So hopefully, that clarifies the issues on that. Yeah. Thank you for the question. And we do provide some target margins at a line of business level. But we really don't think it's appropriate to go through and talk about target margins at a more granular level than that. The one thing I will say, though, associated with margin expansion is that our Diversified Business Group is going to provide us a great opportunity for margin expansion because, as Pete had talked about serving Anthem members more holistically, more deeply. And the Commercial and the Government Business units will pay Diversified Business Group fair market value for the value that Diversified is providing. And then Pete will continue to make a margin on his services. Certainly, the transaction will eliminate intercompany revenue. Yeah, we'll still have target margins on Commercial and Government, and then we'll have the margins within Pete's area. So we do expect margin expansion over the next five years and really driven by that."

            "name": "Morgan Kendrick",
            "content": "Hey there, Stephen. Thank you for the question. I -- first of all, I'd say we are expecting growth in our individual business this cycle. You asked about our margin trajectory on that and how we felt about it. Clearly, we're expecting to -- we price the business accurately. We price it based on our forward view of trend. COVID certainly is a big piece of that. And when we think about it, we've adjusted pricing as necessary, but we're seeing -- and we're still in open enrollment for 1/1. Some of them are extended through the end of the month. And right now, things are looking quite good. You would imagine there are some states, there are puts and takes across the country. But nonetheless, we feel good about it, and we're expecting growth in the first quarter. Thank you for the question. Thanks, it's Morgan here. Thanks for the question. Regarding unique characteristics, one thing we've noticed -- I mean we like this business. As you've said, we see it behave and evolve differently by geography. One of the things is there's a stickiness to it that wasn't there originally. And that's something that's been notable of late. As far as where it's coming from, we're typically seeing it come from other exchange members in the market. There are targeted areas where we've made real discerning efforts to get after deep areas that we're underpenetrated in certain geographies that we have, and they're paying dividends for us. So again, one of the things in the beginning of the ACA, it wasn't a sticky market. There was lots of churn every year. We're seeing that very differently now. And we believe the assets we have and the assets we're bringing to the market will indeed pay dividends for us. So we like the market and look forward to continued work there."

Later, we will conduct a question and answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator instructions]. These instructions will be repeated prior to the question-and-answer portion of this call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Company's management. Please go ahead.\nStephen Tanal : Good morning. And welcome to Anthem 's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relation. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO, John Gallina, our CFO, Peter Haytaian, President of our Diversified Business Group, IngenioRx, Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division, and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives, and close on Anthem 's commitment to its mission. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com.  We'll also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux : Thanks Steve, and good morning everyone. We're pleased to talk with you about another strong quarter. This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.13, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.79. Ahead of expectations, despite another surge in COVID that created challenges throughout the country, once again, Anthem continues to deliver on stakeholder commitments, accelerate growth in every core benefits business, and make considerable progress towards our long-term strategy to transform from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. Addressing the whole person is essential to becoming a trusted lifetime partner in health.  Responding to the pandemic has allowed us to instill new agility and innovation into the business, particularly around solutions for physical health, pharmacy, behavioral and social needs, with an emphasis on maternal health, access to nutritious food, and health disparities. Ultimately, we believe we're only as healthy as the communities we live in, and recognize our important role in ensuring everyone has an opportunity to be and stay healthy. As the healthcare paradigm shift, we're accelerating work to simplify members' and clients' every day experiences, and meet their evolving needs to a personalized experience. Moreover, there's abundant opportunity to modernize further and reinforce our position, leveraging our technology, predictive analytics, and innovative products and services to bring an enhanced experience only Anthem can offer. We expect whole-person healthcare, powered by digital technology to help us achieve our goal of driving commercial medical cost trend down towards the rate of TPI by 2025. Currently, we're exploring more ways to drive differentiated value across medical and pharmacy. Our insight-driven approach is fueling new programs that drive better cost and quality outcomes for our members, including in the areas of behavioral health and autoimmune disease. Additionally, we recently launched a new offering to test the full suite of our capability in the form of a virtual primary care first product, which we expect to demonstrate meaningful reduction in overall cost of care, and greater member satisfaction. We are already selling virtual-first risk-based commercial plans in certain markets across each of Anthem's 14 blue states for the 2022 plan year, featuring simplified plan designs, 24 by 7 service, and leveraging our high performing network that enable affordable price points.  We've also seen strong interest in these capabilities from our fee-based clients, and will be embedding virtual primary care with several large fee-based clients throughout 2022. At the same time, innovative product offerings like Sydney Preferred, which allows employers to customize a digital first health care experience for their employees are gaining considerable momentum. To date, more than 50 national accounts have signed up for Sydney Preferred, representing nearly 900,000 commercial members. To help accelerate our digital platform, we've elevated Rajeev Ronanki to President of Digital Platform. Rajeev will drive the commercialization of our digital capabilities for consumers and care providers, as we re-imagine the health ecosystem.  Then we'll share notable third quarter highlights and business driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021, starting with our Medicaid business which is performing well. Our Healthy Blue plan in partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina has quickly become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. Its success, coupled with the ongoing suspension of eligibility redetermination, drove Anthem's total Medicaid membership, above 10 million at quarter-end, exceeding our internal expectations. Our commitment to members and their community has never been stronger. And we continue to develop innovative solutions to meet their unique holistic health needs. As a result, our focus on reducing health disparities and inequities remains vital to the value Anthem offers day partners. This is reflected in our momentum along with our 100% RFP win rate year-to-date. Looking further ahead, Anthem will launch another new statewide Medicaid managed care contract in Ohio in the summer of 2022. After earning the City of New York 's Group Medicare Advantage contract last quarter, we added several new group MA customers in the third quarter for January 1st, 2022 start dates, and having growing pipelines of new prospects. As part of our strategy to deepen our Medicare Advantage market penetration, we remain focused on converting commercial age-outs to MA relationship, and preparing for a flawless January launch of our Group Medicare Advantage plan for New York City's retiree. Customized solutions at scale underpin our approach to individual Medicare Advantage benefit for 2022.  Many of our MA plans will allow customers to choose what's best for them from a menu of innovative Whole Health benefits. For example, in some areas, the program will include a Kroger grocery card, generous over-the-counter benefits, and up to 60 hours of in-home support to assist with light housekeeping, errand, and companionship. We expect these and other benefit enhancements to help drive another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership next year. Medicare star ratings continue to be a focused area across Anthem. And the ratings released 2 weeks ago show we've made solid progress. We're particularly proud. Health Fund received a five-star rating for the fifth consecutive year.  The only Medicare Advantage health plan in Florida to accomplish such an achievement. For the 2023 payment year, we anticipate approximately 73% of members in plans that CMS rated as 4-plus stars up from 58% on a comparable basis a year ago. That figure will move even higher with the City of New York 's Group Medicare Advantage contract launch next year. At the same time, investments in provider partnerships are accelerating Anthem's evolution towards high quality, value-based care. This is necessary to drive improved outcomes and cost of care across all of our benefits businesses, and is critical in Medicare Advantage where they are impacts reimbursement through star ratings.  This year, more than 60% of our Medicare Advantage spending will be in risk-sharing arrangements. Based on our current contracts, we expect that to increase to more than 70% in 2022 with approximately 30% of Medicare Advantage spending in fully capitated risk arrangements. Investments in our primary care partnerships in particular will support members and drive growth through the expansion of value-based care leading to an even larger proportion of our members and 4-plus star contracts over time. We recognize there's still more work to do, and we'll continue our efforts to raise customer satisfaction by aligning incentives with care providers to improve quality and medication adherence, while simultaneously enhancing our member experience, accelerating our use of data and analytics, and leveraging IngenioRx as our pharmacy benefit manager.  Lastly, a few highlights of the strong growth we see in our commercial business. We're nearing the end of the most robust national account selling season in Anthem's history. Volume of RFPs was down, but averaged size was up considerably, and we want a disproportionate share of new business and expanded services with our existing clients. IngenioRx is also showing exciting growth, with more than fivefold increase in new sales at this point in the selling season, compared to the relatively depressed base a year ago when the pandemic weighed heavily on employer decision-making. The consistent theme across all of our businesses is that each continues to produce strong organic growth.  This droves medical enrolment to more than 45 million U.S. consumers, strengthening Anthem's position as the largest health insurer in America by membership. I'm pleased with the progress we're making towards delivering our strategy, and want to share two recent leadership changes to accelerate our efforts. Pete Haytaian will lead our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx, both of which are critical components of our growth strategy. Pete has an impressive track record of growth and innovation in his previous roles, leading Anthem's commercial and government businesses. With Pete 's transition, we're confident our commercial and specialty business division will maintain its strong momentum under leadership of Morgan Kendrick, who has driven market-leading growth across critical lines of our commercial business, including national accounts and most recently, as President of Anthem's commercial west markets, our largest region. The breadth and depth of our collective leadership ensures we stand ready to deliver on our promises to stakeholders across all areas of our business and will guide Anthem to long-term sustainable growth. It's a privilege to work alongside such a strong group of leaders committed to advancing our purpose and mission. In summary, our actions and the focus and discipline we've brought to the business have positioned Anthem for the next several years of growth. Our strategy to extend our role from a partner in health benefit to a lifetime trusted partner in health is resonating in the marketplace, as evidenced by our growth. Our response to COVID brings a new level of agility and speed to the business, along with more opportunities to reach consumers and care providers than ever before.  And we continue to simplify and personalize our member relationships with relevant benefits and enhanced innovative experiences. where and when they want. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nJohn Gallina : Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. This growth was a result of focused execution against our strategic priorities despite a challenging backdrop created by another surge in COVID. Our third quarter results once again, demonstrate the balance and resilience of our core benefit businesses, and the strong growth momentum we are producing across the board. We ended the quarter with 45.1 million members, growth of 2.4 million lives year-over-year, or 5.7%, including growth of 730,000 during the quarter, led by the successful launch of our Healthy Blue Medicaid plan in North Carolina. In addition to the 426,000 members gained in that state, we produced incremental organic growth of nearly 380,000 members during the quarter, driven by strong growth on our Medicaid and commercial risk-based businesses. This growth was partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our group fee-based business, consistent with our expectations. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $35.5 billion, an increase of 16% versus prior-year quarter, and nearly 18% on a HIF adjusted basis. The increase was driven by higher premium revenue associated with strong membership growth in our Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial risk businesses, as well as rate increases to cover cost trends, and ongoing momentum in our diversified service businesses, including in IngenioRx.  The benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.7%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Excluding the impact of the HIF, our medical loss ratio would have decreased by approximately 50 basis points, driven by an unfavorable rate adjustment in our Medicaid business in the third quarter of 2020. All in, the cost of care was above what we would consider to be normalized or baseline levels in the third quarter of this year, driven by higher COVID cost in the month of August and September. But medical costs were nonetheless better than we had expected for the quarter overall, With lower non COVID utilization helping absorb the higher-than-expected COVID related cost. Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 11.1%, a decrease of 620 basis points from the 17.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to charges we took last year related to business optimization and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement.  Excluding charges from the base year, and the impact of the repeal of the health insurance tax, our SG&A ratio would have decreased by approximately 130 basis points, driven by leverage associated with growth and operating revenues. Partially offset by higher spending to support our growth and our transition to becoming a digital enterprise for health. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $2.5 billion- or 1.7-times net income. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, down approximately 100 basis points from the 39.9% as of the end of the second quarter. The decrease was driven by growth in shareholders equity associated with our earnings in the quarter and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding.  We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves, given the ongoing uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in lengthening in cycle times that we have seen since the pandemic began. We ended the third quarter with 46.8 days in claims payable, a decrease of 1.3 days compared to the second quarter, and an increase of 5.7 days as compared to the prior year quarter. The timing of our acquisition of MMM inflated days and claims payable in the second quarter, and drove the sequential change. Excluding timing-related impacts associated with the acquisition, our days and claims payable would've increased by 0.2 days sequentially. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.85 from greater than $25.50, putting us at the high-end of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%.  Please note that this guidance continues to reflect the total COVID and non - COVID costs combined, exceeding baseline in every month of the fourth quarter and assumes a similar overall net headwind from COVID for the year relative to our prior guidance. Given significant outperformance in the third quarter on our investment income line, we have increased our full-year outlook for investment income by $100 million to approximately $1.2 billion, which is 260 million above our initial outlook of $940 million. Much of the outperformance in this area stems from stellar results in our alternative investment portfolio year-to-date that we would not expect to recur. Accordingly, we believe that there is at least $200 million of non-recurring upside in the investment income line that should be removed when assessing the appropriate base for earnings growth for 2022, equating to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share in 2021 and implying a baseline for growth entering 2022 of $25.20. Most importantly, our businesses are performing well with strong growth momentum that we expect we'll carry into 2022. Although we will not provide specific guidance for next year on this call, I would now like to shift focus to the tailwinds and headwinds that we are considering into next year starting with the tailwinds. Recall that our 2021 guidance continues to embed a significant net headwind related to the effects of COVID.  While it is too early to declare how much of the overall net headwind, we will be able to earn back in 2022, we do believe that we will recover a portion of it resulting in a year-over-year tailwind. Based on our strong competitive positioning, we expect another year of double-digit membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We also expect strong growth in our Commercial membership, aided by what is shaping up to be the strongest national account selling season in the history of the company. We expect accretion from the annualization of earnings of our acquisitions of MMM and myNEXUS. And we expect an EPS lift from our share repurchase program, which was opportunistic during recent periods of volatility in our stock price. Our tailwinds will be weighed against known headwinds and these include the dilution associated with the first year of operations of our new Group Medicare Advantage contract serving New York City's retirees, which we continue to expect will launch on January 1st, as well as dilution related to the startup and launch of our new Medicaid contract in Ohio, which we expect to begin on July 1st, 2022.  In addition, the resumption of Medicaid eligibility re-determinations, assuming a return to a more normal operating environment, and finally, the non-recurrence of the upside in the investment income line this year that I had described earlier. Based on what we know today, we believe our tailwinds will largely offset our headwind, enabling us to reaffirm our commitment to growth and adjusted earnings per share of at least 12% in 2022 after adjusting for the portion of investment income that we have identified is non-recurring. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call when we will discuss our 2022 outlook in more detail. In closing, we continue to execute against our strategic growth priorities, and are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong growth and continued reinvestment in our business, all while maintaining a solid balance sheet given the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic. And with that, Operator, please open the line to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Once again, we ask that each participant limit themselves to a single question to allow ample time to respond to each participant that may wish to participate in this portion of the call. For our first question, we will go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice : Thanks. Hi, everybody. I appreciate the headwinds and tailwinds for next year that you're offering. I guess when you look at those items that you've delineated, a lot of them look like they're pretty well set at this point. What would be the ones where there is the greatest potential variability? I'm assuming the COVID related issue. How much of that you get back next year is probably one, but can you comment on that? Where there's the greatest variability among those items?\nJohn Gallina : Good morning A.J. and thank you for the question. Associated with the headwinds and tailwinds, of course, we do want to look at them in their entirety but we should think about the potential variability, COVID has the absolute most uncertainty of any line item on there. I mean it's been an incredible situation that we've been through as a country since March of 2020 and COVID continues to have uncertainty associated with it. The New York group retiree business are still going through their enrollment process so we don't have the absolute exact number of lives lined up at this point in time. And so there's some variability there. But you are correct. We do have some pretty good line of sight on most of the rest of them. But COVID is clearly the lion's share of uncertainty at this point.\nGail Boudreaux : AJ, I'd add to John 's response that one of the things that we do feel very good about is the underlying strength and the core of our -- all of our benefits businesses. Our growth's been strong, and I think we've been performing very well in line with the expectations we set. So next question, please. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify something then a question. The clarification is just wanted to make sure, John, you were talking about 12% growth, and then you talked about that off at $25.20 jump-off point. So that's number 1, and then just the question is on cost trend, looks like the Government margins were materially stronger than commercial in the quarter. So you gave some overall posturing commentary, but was hoping you could give us some trend breakdown between commercial Medicaid and Medicare, how that performed in the quarter versus that slightly above normal overall discussion you had. Thanks.\nJohn Gallina : Yes. Thanks Justin, I appreciate the question. In terms of the jump off point for 2022, you are correct. We've quantified our investment income, outperformance for the year. We believe that there is at least $200 million that's unlikely to recur. And so that $200 million equates to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share. And then you take that off of our updated guidance, and we believe the appropriate jump off point for 2022 growth is $25.20. So appreciate the opportunity to clarify that.  Associated with the various lines of business, the commercial profitability, they're still very, very good. However, commercial had the surge of COVID in August and September was really more significantly pronounced within the commercial line of business than it was in the other two lines of business. We took the opportunity to reserve prudently within the commercial line for that spike and to build commercial reserves as a result of what we're seeing at that point in time. Fortunately, non - COVID came in much lower in September across all lines business, which allowed our quarter to come out in a really, really good place. Medicare was very much consistent with expectations.  Medicaid was actually a little bit better than expectations for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had guided to be above baseline costs for COVID and non - COVID combined for each of the 3 months in the third quarter and we were. We were just ended up being better than our expectations. But the commercial issue was really had to do with the spike in August associated with COVID. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux : Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes : Yeah, thanks a lot. Could you talk a little bit about the strategy and vision for Diversified and Ingenio, with Pete moving into that role? And maybe as part of that, talking a little bit about the pipeline of opportunities in the Diversified and Ingenio book, as well as selling government services and other Blues. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux : Thanks for the multitude of questions I'll ask Pete in his new role to respond to Lance.\nPeter Haytaian : Thanks, Lance. No, I really appreciate it. I'll -- I think I'll touch on the growth associated with Ingenio first, and then reference Diversified Business Group. And I do want to thank Gail and the team for putting me in this position. I do think I'm in a unique position having non-Government and Commercial have a perspective on this. And I think working collectively as an enterprise, we can do very well in penetrating the Anthem portfolio to a much greater degree.  But as it relates to your question on Ingenio and growth in Ingenio, we worked very closely with the commercial business. And as we talked about before, the greatest opportunity for us is penetrating the self-funded business. I'd say that activity for us has really picked up this year relative to last year. We're seeing really nice success plans down market. on the smaller side of the business and the middle market. So we're definitely seeing more activity there and we're also seeing a lot more wins from that perspective.  And as we've talked about, that's really a sweet spot from a financial and profitability perspective, whereas that's a really good position for us to be in on the larger end of the market with some of the jumbo accounts. We are also seeing activity pick up as it relates to pharmacy. But it is a competitive space and we see the power of incumbency being a little more significant and a factor there. So heading into 2022, as it relates to Ingenio, we feel really good about our growth trajectory and our performance and net membership growth will be improved relative to what we've seen in 2021. As it relates to the Diversified Business group and our strategies and then I'll also talk strategically about Ingenio a bit, I'm really excited about where we are. If you think about where the puck is going in healthcare, you think about the significance of specialty pharmacy. You heard Gail talk earlier about virtual and the opportunities for virtual even in pharmacy. There's tremendous opportunity for that business to continue to grow. We're at the beginning of the evolution of, I think, that pharmacy business and there's a great opportunity there for us and to penetrate the Anthem business.  And then as it relates to the DBG portfolio, if you think about the verticals that we talked about at Investor Day and the opportunity there, a tremendous opportunity. So you think about behavioral health and the opportunities there with Beacon as a leading asset in the space, and we think there's tremendous opportunity to grow that business and diversify that business. When you think about side of care and redirection, it becomes hugely important as it relates to the Commercial business and cost of care when you think about assets like AIM and myNEXUS, a recent transaction where we're seeing tremendous success. And then you think about managing the chronically ill and the great assets we have there around CareMore and Aspire. I would say this, Lance, that my -- and I've only been on the job for about a week-and-a-half, so I don't want to be too presumptuous here, but the opportunity to penetrate Anthem is very significant across our entire portfolio: Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial, but I also think there's tremendous external opportunities. So I look forward to leading us and working with my colleagues, Felicia and Morgan on growing the business together.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you, Pete, and thanks for the question, Lance. I think to sum up what Pete has shared; this really is part of our ongoing journey and evolution in Anthem that we shared with you at our Investor Day. It really is part of our transformation from a health benefits company to truly a trusted lifetime partner in health and we see significant opportunities. And I think this shows the maturing of the strategy we shared. So thanks for the question and next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matthew Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Borsch: Thank you. Hoping you could comment on the aftermath of the Blue settlement, particularly as it relates to how you see competition among the Blues and your role with that changing, maybe intensifying as we go into next year and after.\nGail Boudreaux : Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. We are still in the midst of that litigation and the settlement is ongoing, so I won't comment. I think it's inappropriate to comment at this time. But given the tone of your question, I think it's really important, and we've had a long history, quite frankly, up partnering with Blue in addition to working with them on accounts that are in our service areas, part of the seeding process. And so, we expect that to continue, expect, obviously, to offer the capabilities that we have.  Pete just shared with you what we're doing with IngenioRx. We also think our diversified business capabilities are going to be incredibly important. Some of our Digital Platform capabilities that we've also offered to other Blues. So I can't really comment on where we are in terms of that litigation because it's not finally settled yet, but we feel that there's a significant amount of opportunities for us even outside of this settlement to worked with Blue partners across the country. Thanks to question and next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess I just want to go to membership. ASO dipped and you cited some of the economic backdrop, but commercial risk was up nicely sequentially. So is there some shift between the two? Or maybe just any thoughts around those dynamics. And then one thing specifically around individual enrollment as well are pretty nicely sequentially. And, John, to your comments around higher COVID costs, was there any disproportionate pressure on the exchanges specifically that sort of weighed on margins in the segment? And then just hoping you could talk about your positioning on the exchanges for 2022 and expectations for growth there. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux : Ralph, thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick, who's leading our Commercial businesses also, they've been intimately involved in these, to respond to your questions. Please, Morgan.\nMorgan Kendrick: Thanks, Gail. And Ralph, thanks for the question. There was a lot there. And when you talk about your comments about the reductions in the large group business, that's certainly in line with our expectations. We were expecting reduction in our fee-based business. We've had, as you indicated, noted, nice growth on the risk-based business across the segment. Individual, as you've noted, has benefited from a long extending special enrollment period. So we've seen year-over -- month-over-month growth there. Also, when you look at our large group, small group business, we've seen month-over-month growth in sales exceeding lapses. And notably, our large group businesses performed quite well. In fact, 23 of the last 25 quarters, our sales have exceeded lapses. Looking forward into the new year, clearly, it's a competitive geography and competitive market when you look at individuals and HDA. It's one of those that I would characterize it as rational nonetheless. And one that we've -- not inconsistent with our strategies in the past, we take a very disciplined approach. We look at this market-by-market, county-by-county.\nMorgan Kendrick: And in fact, as we expand next year for 2022, we're going to be at 83% of the counties that we can serve. That's up from 71% from the prior year. And this is most notably done by leveraging our unique provider partnerships, leveraging the scale and density we have in our geographies to provide value for the market. Again, the strategy is not a shortsighted one and we're confident the pricing is appropriate on our modeling of our forward trends. So thank you again for the question.\nGail Boudreaux : And one last thing, Ralph. You asked the question about anything distinctive about the individual relative to COVID, and I would say no. I mean, our individual business has performed in line. So across the board, we saw -- as John shared, higher COVID spikes in commercial -- individual is not unique or distinct that we feel that we're appropriately positioned in that market. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gil from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gilson : Thanks very much, and good morning. I just wanted to go back out to your thoughts on the virtual primary care offering. One, can you talk about how that product will be priced? And then secondly, If they are going to be an all 14 of your markets, or will this be more of a limited type of offering initially? And then lastly, as I think about virtual primary care, how do we think about the cost trends there and the potential savings when we think about those types of products.\nGail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, Lisa. I think it's actually a really important one as we think about the next-generation of where products are going to go. One of the things that's happened is the pandemic has really highlighted the need for these virtual care services. We shared with you quite some time ago, our JV with Hydrogen Health, and we've been in the market actually working closely with our partners to deliver those services, particularly best-in-class urgent and care, primary care, using chat and texting. What we're talking about now is, I'll call it the next-generation of virtual primary care.  We've gotten some experience in our early entree with virtual care over the last year, and now we're continuing to evolve that. So we did launch as I shared in my remarks, this virtual first services. Think what's interesting and unique about this is they're integrated with our high-performance network, and that's really important. And we're seeing a lot of traction in our high-performance network. And I know we've shared previously, our high -performance network has anywhere from 12% to 15% cost structure differential. And as you think about virtual primary care added to that, we expect those to be the starting point of what we can gain traction on.  So I'm really encouraged by this initial launch. We can -- we're going to continue to, I think, innovate and evolve from that. In terms of where we are doing it, we are working in our Blue states. We're in most of our markets right now. We have offerings not in every county, but we're going to continue to expand that as we certainly learn about it, look at the alignment. A lot of this does, as I said, rely on our high-performing networks and our ability to use both virtual care as well as our high -performing network. And just to give you a sense of what it is, I mean, we're looking at the offerings to cover virtual visits with the $0 copay simplified plan designs, 24 by 7 service to leverage the network. Value-based contracts are at the core of this to drive that cost structure differential. And again, we would expect at least 15% below traditional products. But again, that's a starting point. We're going to gain experience with this. And there's been a lot of interest. We've seen a significant amount of interest. We've offered it first in our fully insured risk-based business and now our national fee accounts are interested in embedding this in their offerings. And as you heard, I think from my opening comments and then what Morgan said, we've had one of our strongest ever national account-selling seasons. And again, I do credit the innovation we're bringing around digital to the success we're having there, and just a fundamentally strong differentiated cost structure really driven by high -performance networks. But thanks for the question. We are -- we're excited and optimistic about how we think that this can drive future trend and future opportunities for our clients. So again, more to come on this, but you'll be hearing a lot more about it in the coming months as we gain more traction with our employers. So thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?\nGail Boudreaux : We can. Thank you.\nGary Taylor: Okay, sorry. As I was thinking about 2022, I wanted to ask about something I thought would be a tailwind and something I thought would be a headwind but you didn't mention, so just some color would be helpful. Was thinking that the special enrollment period on exchanges, if that were to eventually go away, would potentially be a tailwind for that business, but you said you're performing in line there, so maybe don't see that as material tailwind, and then on the Medicaid side of the house, you did mention redeterminations as a headwind, but we certainly note for you and across the board, that seems to be a population that's not just vaccine hesitant but utilization hesitant and the MLR s look really strong there. So I was thinking there could be headwind, not just on redetermination, but on margin as well. So just wanted some color on those two things.\nJohn Gallina : Yes, sure, Gary. Thank you for the question. So let me see if I can address these appropriately. With the special enrollment period and the exchanges, we have talked about the fact that exchanges are a nice strategy of ours. We're being very, very prudent in terms of our approach. We're going from having I think just a little bit over 70% of our counties covered, just over 80% of our counties covered next year. And we do expect some nice membership growth associated with the individual. But I would say that is all captured in just our core underlying growth in the fundamentals of the business performing extremely well.  We expect all of our businesses to grow, and the individual is no different. In terms of the Medicaid in the redeterminations, the headwind that we referenced really has to do with Medicaid membership, but this is my opportunity to again talk about the balance and resilience of our membership and our catcher's mitt. And we may be able to turn that headwind into a tailwind depending on where those folks go. We do believe that once redeterminations start, that we will be able to maintain a significant amount of that membership within an Anthem product. We offer a product for every American in every situation, young, old, rich, poor, sick, healthy. We have a product for all of them.  And right now, there is a significant number of members within our Medicaid plans. And after redetermination occurs, Medicaid may shrink a little bit, but that means that there's really some significant growth opportunities in other lines of business. I didn't spike it out specifically because we think it's a driver and we could actually turn a headwind into a tailwind. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux : Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Baxter from Wells Fargo Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter : Yeah. Hi. Thanks. You touched on this a little bit, but was hoping you could expand on the national account outlook for next year. We'd love to hear more about what you think is driving that growth and what you're seeing in terms of competitive dynamics in that market. And then just to clarify, was that commentary influenced at all by what insight you're getting from your clients about in - group expectations or that's purely a comment about the new accounts that you wanted? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux : I'll ask Morgan to address that.\nMorgan Kendrick: Yes, Steve, thank you for the question. And as Gail noted, the national business continues to perform exceptionally well, and also noted there was a bit of a dampening in the RFP activity, it was down. But when you think about it, it was down in numbers of the -- of RFP s, it was up in membership, and Anthem had an exceptionally successful year\nMorgan Kendrick: Up-market did quite well. I think one of the other things that was notably observed is a record number of customers that went out for a -- that went from a multi-partner healthcare solution to a single partner healthcare solution in selected Anthem. And to get directly to your question, to me, we have to earn the right to win every day. And I think when you -- so look at our assets and how they are resonating in the market, you look at the advocacy-based Whole Health digital solutions are winning.\nMorgan Kendrick: When you think about Sydney, Gail mentioned earlier that we have 50 customers that were Sydney Preferred, which is theoretically our digital front door or we could call it our gateway to help. It's the entry point for all the other assets that we deliver. Also, when we think about 23, I mean, these assets continue to be innovated upon, and like I said, it's incumbent upon us to earn this right to when, we don't take it lightly. But the market is loudly voting with their feet and -- so we're excited about where we're headed in '23.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Cottrell : Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask about, Gail, you mentioned behavioral briefly. Curious if you can provide a little bit more comment on the Beacon cross-selling efforts and how that's going across both the government and commercial businesses?\nGail Boudreaux : Great. Thank you. I'll offer a quick comment and then I'll ask Pete to to comment on that because it fits within our Diversified Business Group. But overall, we know that there has been significant need for behavioral health. And what I want to just touch on briefly is the tight that Morgan said to Whole Health. And we -- Beacon has always been a very strong player in the Medicaid space. And we're continuing to integrate it into our overall government business, but it's got a big upside in the commercial space. And maybe, Pete, some early commentary from what you're saying.\nPeter Haytaian : No, I appreciate, Ralph. Just to remind everybody, Beacon serves about 44 million members, 13 million of which is Anthem. The services are very broad, and as I said, Beacon 's an industry-leading asset, it's been a leader in the behavioral health space for a long time. So as it relates to some of the services from mild, moderate, to acute mental health, treatment for family support, crisis prevention, opioid abuse, FMI, EAP programs, it's a broad portfolio, which really will serve, I think, Anthem really well. The other thing I'll say, and this was very important to us and it really worked out from a strategic perspective. But the pandemic obviously really accentuated the need for behavioral health. We experienced three times more people reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression in this period, 2.5 times more people reporting suicidal ideation, and with opioid abuse, there was a very significant increase. And so that plays really well across our portfolio. We obviously have a broad portfolio across Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial. The integration process is going really well between the parties. We actually, as it relates to penetrating, the Anthem business have embraced a lot of the clinical programs and expertise of Beacon as we integrate. We also, in my old life on the commercial side, we worked on new product offerings. A product called Behavioral Health Advantage which is being deployed in 2022. And then obviously, as it relates to our government program business working very closely with Felicia and the government team -- and the Medicare team on a post-acute care product, and this is just the beginning. I think there will continue to be tremendous opportunities around behavioral. One of the areas that I'm very focused on is also virtual, and the importance of virtual. We've seen an exponential increase in virtual services as it relates to Beacon and penetrating our portfolio in that regard, will become very important going forward. I appreciate the question.\nGail Boudreaux : Thanks, Pete and the only thing, I guess I would add is you think about the commercial markets, that next-generation of EAP services in area that we are highly focused on. And you've heard us share our strategy about sub-segment market within the commercial business. So we see it clearly in the employer space expansion student space to military services space where we see the demand and need for behavioral health services dramatically increasing as a result of the pandemic. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Question on utilization. John, you talked about the fact that September you saw a dip in non - COVID utilization. How is it trending in October? And if I recall last quarter, you said that the MLR guidance did low-end of the range assumes that I think going to end the year above baseline. So how are we trending there? And then in line with that, if we think about 2022 your commercial pricing, what did you embed in your assumptions regarding return of core utilization?\nJohn Gallina : Thank you for the question Ricky. And maybe I'll talk a little bit about the fourth quarter and then turn it over to Morgan to talk a little bit more about 2022. But in terms of the fourth quarter, our expectations and our guidance are that the COVID and non COVID combined will continue to be above baseline each month in the fourth quarter. So obviously the entirety of the fourth quarter being above baseline. We are seeing very good trends, as I stated we had the spike in August, it started to decline coming into September, non COVID utilization was lower in September than we had expected. October is relatively close to expectations at this point, but there's a lot of uncertainties in the fourth quarter.  The Delta variant is still out there, and we want to be very respectful for it, as well as any other new variants that may or may not exist. And we are expecting an increase in testing, an increase in some of the vaccinations and booster shots, especially with the kids. It's unclear right now exactly when the 5-year - old will be eligible for vaccination, but we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of our guidance associated with that cost structure as well. And as you -- I'm sure you already know, the fourth quarter just on a normal basis has a higher seasonality in terms of MLR. And so, that's obviously factored in as well. But I'd say, at the end of the day, we've been very cautious and very prudent in our fourth quarter expectations with combination of COVID and non-COVID combined being above baseline. Morgan.\nMorgan Kendrick: Yeah, John, thank you. And, Ricky, thanks for the question. I would -- John covered most of it, I think. I would say, looking next year, it's not indifferent. We remain confident in the approach and our discipline. In consistent with what we've done quarter-over-quarter year-over-year, we're pricing to forward view of trend. Certainly, that's always respectful of market uncertainty. And as John indicated, COVID is going to be around for a while. We've done extensive work to assess various scenarios and how that could play out. But nonetheless, we feel quite confident that way we priced the '22 business. So thank you again for the question.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please, go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. Just wanted to dig in a little bit into the redetermination headwind that you mentioned. Is there any way for you to kind of size how much memberships today you think you have due to redeterminations, how you're thinking about net losses, how much you might pick up on the exchanges in the commercial market. And then, as it relates to Medicaid rates, how you feel about Medicaid rates broadly, particularly again, with redeterminations coming in that can influence what rates are appropriate given the risk pool. So, those 3 aspects.\nJohn Gallina : Sure, Kevin. I'll see if I can start out and respond to your questions. But in terms of the redetermination, we're really taking a look at where we think these members are going to go and there's been a lot of other studies out there that we think are relatively credible. But we believe that by the end of next year, and that assumes that redeterminations do start to occur maybe late, early second quarter of 2022, that will still have a good 35% of those folks would still be maintained on the Medicaid rolls. We're looking at about 45% of them going back into employer-sponsored plans, and that would take the -- about 20% being eligible for subsidized coverage on exchanges.  And as I stated, we have products and all those things, and we expect to keep and maintain our fair share. So we feel very good about our opportunity and our ability to keep the membership within an -- the Anthem family over the course of next year. And then as it relates to the Medicaid pricing, we learned a lot a few years ago in terms of working with states being very proactive and ensuring that we're having actuarially - justified rates, and we'll certainly continue to do that. It's very early in the ratings season, but we're comfortable with what we're seeing to-date and building our financial plan with prudent assumptions that we believe are well supported. And the states are very -- say we're having some very productive conversations with the states as well about ensuring that we get actuarially - justified rates throughout the future. The only other thing I'll say about the Medicaid is there are a lot of financial measures that are in place now that -- far more than used to be in place in terms of collars, corridors, and things like that. That -- it really helped maintain the profitability and maintain the stability of that marketplace. So really need to look at Medicaid over a long period of time. Thank you, Kevin.\nGail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. My question is about kind of your strategic investment preference. Gail, you've emphasized that for Anthem, your preferences to partner rather than own your provider networks. I'm wondering if you could shine maybe a brighter light on how your investments in behavioral and digital and some of the other areas that you've mentioned kind of accelerate your strategy and driving a better return for Anthem than the possibility of owning and controlling some of your key providers. Just I'm sure that those others are higher return, but in what way are they for Anthem? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux : Thanks for the question, David. A couple of things, I think you hit on many of the core drivers. First and foremost, as we've said, because of the density that we have in our markets, we believe that investing in partnerships makes the most sense because we believe we can drive better membership, better stars ratings, and with 1 out of 8 patients being an Anthem member, the density of working with those providers provides us a good return. And also remember, we can participate in the profit stream s there by embedding some of our DBG assets, or our other assets around Interior and so, it's not that we're walking away from participating in those profit streams. We actually think we have a much more capitally efficient use by investing, partnering, and then pulling through the other assets that we have invested in.  And so that's the core of our strategy and it worked really well and we're continuing to accelerate that strategy. And as I shared, we expect to have 70% in value-based arrangements, 30% in full capitated arrangements. It's a big driver for our Medicare Advantage business. Quite frankly, all of our benefits businesses are going to have an opportunity there. In terms of other areas that we're investing and we've said that we really want to transform ourselves and part of that transformation is building this digital platform for health. The opportunities are inside of Anthem as well as with our Blue partners and we see again opportunities to commercialize that.  That's going to be over the next several years, one of the reasons they elevated Rajeev Ronanki who has been leading this area, is to really explore those opportunities. Again, we've been doing that inside of the Anthem, but we think there's an opportunity with our partners to do more. Areas around Sydney, for example Sydney Health, which is gaining great traction, our Health OS, which we think could be a broader opportunity for the Health ecosystem. We've done quite a bit of investment in Stars and heat is quality improvement in AI and analytics, digital therapeutics. So there's a broad range of things around the digital capabilities and ecosystem we're building. But in terms of the value, again, we look at the most efficient way to deploy our capital, where we have our strength, which is the density in the markets we serve, and how it fills I think our strategy and then how we pull through Ingenio, DBG, and other services, which really are not -- those are still immature in the sense that we haven't pulled them through to the potential that they have and excited about Pete 's leadership there, given his understanding of both commercial and the government business and the opportunities that exist. But thanks for the question. Again, we think it's a really strong future growth opportunity for us. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette : Great. Thanks. Good morning. So I have another question on the lower than expected non - COVID utilization for the third quarter. I guess I was curious if you have any additional color by medical cost category, whether it's inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, etc. What I'm really curious about is specifically whether any cost category had a more notable falloff versus baseline when thinking about the sequential trends in 3Q versus the trend back in June quarter. Thanks.\nJohn Gallina : Thanks for your question, Steve. In terms of the specificity, I would say that what we saw in September was that inpatient non - COVID probably dropped the most of all of the different buckets that you stated. We don't view any of these things as being changing to the ultimate baseline. There were announcements that were made at the beginning of September that certain facilities were deferring or canceling some elective procedures in order to ensure that there is appropriate bed space. So while certainly we saw the impact on the financials, we do monitor pre-OSP research, various other things, and don't really view that situation as a significant change through the baseline going forward. But thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux : Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel : Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about the additional Group MA contracts that you called out that you've added in the 3Q for 2022. Any chance that you can maybe size the number of lives that you're expecting from those? And then just on the Group NYC contract implementation, I know you're still working on membership and things like that, but interested if you can maybe bring expense for loss, the dilution, you're thinking about for 2022 against that 12% EPS growth off the baseline you talked about. That will be helpful as well. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux : I was going to ask Felicia to respond on your MA questions first and then we'll have John. Thank you.\nFelicia Norwood: Good morning, and thank you for the question. I'll say, Scott, that at the end of the day, the additional contracts that Gail referenced, we're certainly pleased with the opportunity to add those to our business for 1/1/22. They are not going to be material drivers of their own. But what they do is that they represent the ability for us to continue to penetrate that pipeline that we have with our Commercial customers. So as you know, our strategy has always been to be able to penetrate the inherent commercial pipeline that we have so that we're able to keep members Blue for life. And what we've done in terms of that third quarter is to have a very robust pipeline that gives us some very nice sized groups, certainly much smaller than anything you've seen around city of New York or anything else, but they are not going to be material drivers in bit, I would say, very closely with what we consider the sweet spot when we look at the opportunities to grow MA going forward.  We still consider this a very strategic asset for us in being able to grow that business as we go forward. Once again, we are very poised to deliver on the launch of the City of New York business for 1/1/22, and are certainly pleased with the opportunity to be able to continue to support New York retirees, who have been customers for Empire for a long period of time. So this is another, I would say, affirmation of our strategy around what we're doing with respect to group MA business. And additionally, the pipeline for this business remains strong as we head into 2023. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to talk about the dilution.\nJohn Gallina : Thank you, Felicia and Scott, I appreciate the question. Unfortunately, this is third quarter call and we're really not going to get into specificity associated with guidance for 2022. We'll talk in more detail about that at the next quarter. And as I said, New York's still going through their enrollment process, so we don't have all the information that quite fine-tuned, but what I would ask you to do is to really evaluate the tailwinds and the headwinds that I provided in their entirety. And then after you adjust for the out performance and investment income, we think that those headwinds and tailwinds pretty much offset each other and will allow us to achieve our 12 to 15% growth for the future. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux : Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess this is probably going to be a 22 question as well, John, but I was wondering if you could claim any numbers around the success of Ingenio, given all the positive commentary. Can we just have any comments on how you guys are thinking about the opportunities with generics to [Indiscernible] and biosimilars in general?\nJohn Gallina : Yeah, thanks for that. Thanks for that question. As you referenced as it relates to Ingenio, we're really pleased with the performance. In large part, the performance this year was due to strong membership and volume across the entire portfolio, so all our lines of business. And utilization is also tracking to expectation. So we feel good about that heading into 2022, as well as the growth that I talked about and our focus on penetrating the ASO business. So we feel good about the Ingenio business heading into 2022, the growth and then the stability of the business in terms of its margin contribution.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Raskin: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. How do you think about the No Surprises Act around your strategy or network contracting and maybe potential changes in the balance of power between payers and providers and local markets? And specific to Anthem, do you think best cost position, biggest discounts, is that helpful or harmful as you think about the future?\nGail Boudreaux : Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of the overall, our past year, we have had a cost structure advantage in a cost structure advantage. But as you heard in my comment, given our market density, we are moving heavily towards value-based payment. I mean, that is at the core of our strategy. So that's an alignment of working with care providers in a much different way.  And again, we believe both the investments we're making in primary care, the investments we're making in downstream homecare, other things through our Diversified Business Group, IngenioRx that we have an opportunity to bring those assets together uniquely. And then, leverage the density, originally, in our Commercial business, but now our Medicaid business and our Medicare Advantage business, so we feel we've made really good strides on that and we actually see a better alignment with care providers than we've ever had in the past. So quite frankly, I'm optimistic about where we're heading, and I think that that really is the core of our strategy. So thank you for the question and next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Last year you guys in the industry waived a lot of co-insurance requirements, and just remind me what you're doing now, are you -- are we back to 2019 co-pay, co-insurance member requirements? Are we still waiving on MA for primary care? I guess really the question here is thinking through 2022 and any headwinds or tailwinds as we think about any changes and member cost sharing. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux : Thanks. Thank you for the question, Whit. Certainly during this heart of the pandemic, where non - COVID utilization dropped significantly, and we also wanted to be a very thoughtful participant in what was happening. We did a number of waiving of cost shares as you know, it was part of our response across all of our businesses.\nGail Boudreaux : As we headed into 2021, those normal -- I'll call it normal course, came back into play mostly because non - COVID utilization returned back to normal levels in many instances in total and there weren\u2019t significant drops. So from that perspective, we're following the policies that we have across the board right now and then heading into 2022. Thanks for the question. Next question.\nOperator: And our final question will go to the line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nFrank Morgan: Good morning. There is a lot of suggestions about labor with providers, and I'm just curious, are you starting to have discussions when you start to negotiate with the providers about their wage inflation outlook they're seeing, and what is your sense of that? And then secondly, just any early initial insights into what might be resonating so far in the annual enrollment period. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks for the double question. The first one around the labor market, clearly across all labor markets, people are seeing pressure on the ability to get employment levels up to where they need to, and then there is some pressure. In terms of our negotiated contract, we do those over three-year cycle and we're also very focused, again, on value-based payments. So I think the big opportunity is to move away from individual unit costs increases, which has been the historical, I guess, trend in the industry to really bundling value-based payment, paying for episodes and procedures.  And that's really where we've been. So at this stage, what I'd say is look, we're always in a dynamic environment in terms of our negotiation, but we feel we factored that into how we're looking at the forward view of everything that's going on, and we just see the biggest opportunity is not just only managing unit costs, but really managing value and part of the value-based payments because there is a much better alignment of taking -- doing the right services at the right time, and that's our view. But in terms of our forward review, again, we're taking into consideration everything. And again, many of our largest contracts are on a 3-year basis, so not all of them obviously are in play right now. Thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Felicia to talk a little bit about our annual enrollment period, which I think was your second question.\nFelicia Norwood: Yeah. Good morning, Frank, and thank you for the question. If you know, we're in the early days of the annual enrollment period, and we're actually very pleased with what we've seen so far with respect to how we are positioned competitively in terms of our benefits in the plans that we're offering, and feel that we'll be able to produce another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare products. I'll say we're especially pleased with our supplemental benefits, our over-the-counter offerings. These are the things we call our essential extras, everyday extras. We give members an opportunity to choose from a portfolio of benefits that allows them to address during these, particularly the social drivers of health. The other thing I will say is that we are also pleased with how we are positioned with respect to our [indiscernible] products, where we have a very strong value proposition considering our deep knowledge and experience between Medicare and Medicaid, and being able to serve chronic and complex populations. So when we think about where we are today, a little bit less than 5 days in, we feel good about our positioning and look forward to having a very successful AEP.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you Felicia, and thank you again for your interest in Anthem. As we close the call, I want to recognize our associates. This continues to be a challenging year, each day they step up and they step out to live our mission and values and serve our members and communities with care and compassion. I'm impressed and grateful for what they do all the time. We work hard to create a culture at Anthem where everyone feels valued and their contributions make a difference, so I'm particularly proud to see us recently named among America 's 100 great places to work, and healthiest 100 workplaces. I'll leave you with this.  There's increasing opportunity for Anthem to offer elevated personalized experiences as we holistically address what our society needs to be and stay healthy. We're building for tomorrow and beyond, evolving the business to be more digital, moving fast, thinking differently, and operating with discipline. Personally, I'm extremely optimistic for our future. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 AM today through November 19th, 2021.

            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "Thanks, Lance. No, I really appreciate it. I'll -- I think I'll touch on the growth associated with Ingenio first, and then reference Diversified Business Group. And I do want to thank Gail and the team for putting me in this position. I do think I'm in a unique position having non-Government and Commercial have a perspective on this. And I think working collectively as an enterprise, we can do very well in penetrating the Anthem portfolio to a much greater degree.  But as it relates to your question on Ingenio and growth in Ingenio, we worked very closely with the commercial business. And as we talked about before, the greatest opportunity for us is penetrating the self-funded business. I'd say that activity for us has really picked up this year relative to last year. We're seeing really nice success plans down market. on the smaller side of the business and the middle market. So we're definitely seeing more activity there and we're also seeing a lot more wins from that perspective.  And as we've talked about, that's really a sweet spot from a financial and profitability perspective, whereas that's a really good position for us to be in on the larger end of the market with some of the jumbo accounts. We are also seeing activity pick up as it relates to pharmacy. But it is a competitive space and we see the power of incumbency being a little more significant and a factor there. So heading into 2022, as it relates to Ingenio, we feel really good about our growth trajectory and our performance and net membership growth will be improved relative to what we've seen in 2021. As it relates to the Diversified Business group and our strategies and then I'll also talk strategically about Ingenio a bit, I'm really excited about where we are. If you think about where the puck is going in healthcare, you think about the significance of specialty pharmacy. You heard Gail talk earlier about virtual and the opportunities for virtual even in pharmacy. There's tremendous opportunity for that business to continue to grow. We're at the beginning of the evolution of, I think, that pharmacy business and there's a great opportunity there for us and to penetrate the Anthem business.  And then as it relates to the DBG portfolio, if you think about the verticals that we talked about at Investor Day and the opportunity there, a tremendous opportunity. So you think about behavioral health and the opportunities there with Beacon as a leading asset in the space, and we think there's tremendous opportunity to grow that business and diversify that business. When you think about side of care and redirection, it becomes hugely important as it relates to the Commercial business and cost of care when you think about assets like AIM and myNEXUS, a recent transaction where we're seeing tremendous success. And then you think about managing the chronically ill and the great assets we have there around CareMore and Aspire. I would say this, Lance, that my -- and I've only been on the job for about a week-and-a-half, so I don't want to be too presumptuous here, but the opportunity to penetrate Anthem is very significant across our entire portfolio: Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial, but I also think there's tremendous external opportunities. So I look forward to leading us and working with my colleagues, Felicia and Morgan on growing the business together. No, I appreciate, Ralph. Just to remind everybody, Beacon serves about 44 million members, 13 million of which is Anthem. The services are very broad, and as I said, Beacon 's an industry-leading asset, it's been a leader in the behavioral health space for a long time. So as it relates to some of the services from mild, moderate, to acute mental health, treatment for family support, crisis prevention, opioid abuse, FMI, EAP programs, it's a broad portfolio, which really will serve, I think, Anthem really well. The other thing I'll say, and this was very important to us and it really worked out from a strategic perspective. But the pandemic obviously really accentuated the need for behavioral health. We experienced three times more people reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression in this period, 2.5 times more people reporting suicidal ideation, and with opioid abuse, there was a very significant increase. And so that plays really well across our portfolio. We obviously have a broad portfolio across Medicare, Medicaid, and Commercial. The integration process is going really well between the parties. We actually, as it relates to penetrating, the Anthem business have embraced a lot of the clinical programs and expertise of Beacon as we integrate. We also, in my old life on the commercial side, we worked on new product offerings. A product called Behavioral Health Advantage which is being deployed in 2022. And then obviously, as it relates to our government program business working very closely with Felicia and the government team -- and the Medicare team on a post-acute care product, and this is just the beginning. I think there will continue to be tremendous opportunities around behavioral. One of the areas that I'm very focused on is also virtual, and the importance of virtual. We've seen an exponential increase in virtual services as it relates to Beacon and penetrating our portfolio in that regard, will become very important going forward. I appreciate the question."

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks Steve, and good morning everyone. We're pleased to talk with you about another strong quarter. This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.13, and adjusted earnings per share of $6.79. Ahead of expectations, despite another surge in COVID that created challenges throughout the country, once again, Anthem continues to deliver on stakeholder commitments, accelerate growth in every core benefits business, and make considerable progress towards our long-term strategy to transform from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. Addressing the whole person is essential to becoming a trusted lifetime partner in health.  Responding to the pandemic has allowed us to instill new agility and innovation into the business, particularly around solutions for physical health, pharmacy, behavioral and social needs, with an emphasis on maternal health, access to nutritious food, and health disparities. Ultimately, we believe we're only as healthy as the communities we live in, and recognize our important role in ensuring everyone has an opportunity to be and stay healthy. As the healthcare paradigm shift, we're accelerating work to simplify members' and clients' every day experiences, and meet their evolving needs to a personalized experience. Moreover, there's abundant opportunity to modernize further and reinforce our position, leveraging our technology, predictive analytics, and innovative products and services to bring an enhanced experience only Anthem can offer. We expect whole-person healthcare, powered by digital technology to help us achieve our goal of driving commercial medical cost trend down towards the rate of TPI by 2025. Currently, we're exploring more ways to drive differentiated value across medical and pharmacy. Our insight-driven approach is fueling new programs that drive better cost and quality outcomes for our members, including in the areas of behavioral health and autoimmune disease. Additionally, we recently launched a new offering to test the full suite of our capability in the form of a virtual primary care first product, which we expect to demonstrate meaningful reduction in overall cost of care, and greater member satisfaction. We are already selling virtual-first risk-based commercial plans in certain markets across each of Anthem's 14 blue states for the 2022 plan year, featuring simplified plan designs, 24 by 7 service, and leveraging our high performing network that enable affordable price points.  We've also seen strong interest in these capabilities from our fee-based clients, and will be embedding virtual primary care with several large fee-based clients throughout 2022. At the same time, innovative product offerings like Sydney Preferred, which allows employers to customize a digital first health care experience for their employees are gaining considerable momentum. To date, more than 50 national accounts have signed up for Sydney Preferred, representing nearly 900,000 commercial members. To help accelerate our digital platform, we've elevated Rajeev Ronanki to President of Digital Platform. Rajeev will drive the commercialization of our digital capabilities for consumers and care providers, as we re-imagine the health ecosystem.  Then we'll share notable third quarter highlights and business driving initiatives for the balance of fiscal 2021, starting with our Medicaid business which is performing well. Our Healthy Blue plan in partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina has quickly become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina and the leading choice for consumers. Its success, coupled with the ongoing suspension of eligibility redetermination, drove Anthem's total Medicaid membership, above 10 million at quarter-end, exceeding our internal expectations. Our commitment to members and their community has never been stronger. And we continue to develop innovative solutions to meet their unique holistic health needs. As a result, our focus on reducing health disparities and inequities remains vital to the value Anthem offers day partners. This is reflected in our momentum along with our 100% RFP win rate year-to-date. Looking further ahead, Anthem will launch another new statewide Medicaid managed care contract in Ohio in the summer of 2022. After earning the City of New York 's Group Medicare Advantage contract last quarter, we added several new group MA customers in the third quarter for January 1st, 2022 start dates, and having growing pipelines of new prospects. As part of our strategy to deepen our Medicare Advantage market penetration, we remain focused on converting commercial age-outs to MA relationship, and preparing for a flawless January launch of our Group Medicare Advantage plan for New York City's retiree. Customized solutions at scale underpin our approach to individual Medicare Advantage benefit for 2022.  Many of our MA plans will allow customers to choose what's best for them from a menu of innovative Whole Health benefits. For example, in some areas, the program will include a Kroger grocery card, generous over-the-counter benefits, and up to 60 hours of in-home support to assist with light housekeeping, errand, and companionship. We expect these and other benefit enhancements to help drive another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership next year. Medicare star ratings continue to be a focused area across Anthem. And the ratings released 2 weeks ago show we've made solid progress. We're particularly proud. Health Fund received a five-star rating for the fifth consecutive year.  The only Medicare Advantage health plan in Florida to accomplish such an achievement. For the 2023 payment year, we anticipate approximately 73% of members in plans that CMS rated as 4-plus stars up from 58% on a comparable basis a year ago. That figure will move even higher with the City of New York 's Group Medicare Advantage contract launch next year. At the same time, investments in provider partnerships are accelerating Anthem's evolution towards high quality, value-based care. This is necessary to drive improved outcomes and cost of care across all of our benefits businesses, and is critical in Medicare Advantage where they are impacts reimbursement through star ratings.  This year, more than 60% of our Medicare Advantage spending will be in risk-sharing arrangements. Based on our current contracts, we expect that to increase to more than 70% in 2022 with approximately 30% of Medicare Advantage spending in fully capitated risk arrangements. Investments in our primary care partnerships in particular will support members and drive growth through the expansion of value-based care leading to an even larger proportion of our members and 4-plus star contracts over time. We recognize there's still more work to do, and we'll continue our efforts to raise customer satisfaction by aligning incentives with care providers to improve quality and medication adherence, while simultaneously enhancing our member experience, accelerating our use of data and analytics, and leveraging IngenioRx as our pharmacy benefit manager.  Lastly, a few highlights of the strong growth we see in our commercial business. We're nearing the end of the most robust national account selling season in Anthem's history. Volume of RFPs was down, but averaged size was up considerably, and we want a disproportionate share of new business and expanded services with our existing clients. IngenioRx is also showing exciting growth, with more than fivefold increase in new sales at this point in the selling season, compared to the relatively depressed base a year ago when the pandemic weighed heavily on employer decision-making. The consistent theme across all of our businesses is that each continues to produce strong organic growth.  This droves medical enrolment to more than 45 million U.S. consumers, strengthening Anthem's position as the largest health insurer in America by membership. I'm pleased with the progress we're making towards delivering our strategy, and want to share two recent leadership changes to accelerate our efforts. Pete Haytaian will lead our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx, both of which are critical components of our growth strategy. Pete has an impressive track record of growth and innovation in his previous roles, leading Anthem's commercial and government businesses. With Pete 's transition, we're confident our commercial and specialty business division will maintain its strong momentum under leadership of Morgan Kendrick, who has driven market-leading growth across critical lines of our commercial business, including national accounts and most recently, as President of Anthem's commercial west markets, our largest region. The breadth and depth of our collective leadership ensures we stand ready to deliver on our promises to stakeholders across all areas of our business and will guide Anthem to long-term sustainable growth. It's a privilege to work alongside such a strong group of leaders committed to advancing our purpose and mission. In summary, our actions and the focus and discipline we've brought to the business have positioned Anthem for the next several years of growth. Our strategy to extend our role from a partner in health benefit to a lifetime trusted partner in health is resonating in the marketplace, as evidenced by our growth. Our response to COVID brings a new level of agility and speed to the business, along with more opportunities to reach consumers and care providers than ever before.  And we continue to simplify and personalize our member relationships with relevant benefits and enhanced innovative experiences. where and when they want. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our financial results in more detail. AJ, I'd add to John 's response that one of the things that we do feel very good about is the underlying strength and the core of our -- all of our benefits businesses. Our growth's been strong, and I think we've been performing very well in line with the expectations we set. So next question, please. Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Thanks for the multitude of questions I'll ask Pete in his new role to respond to Lance. Thank you, Pete, and thanks for the question, Lance. I think to sum up what Pete has shared; this really is part of our ongoing journey and evolution in Anthem that we shared with you at our Investor Day. It really is part of our transformation from a health benefits company to truly a trusted lifetime partner in health and we see significant opportunities. And I think this shows the maturing of the strategy we shared. So thanks for the question and next question, please. Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. We are still in the midst of that litigation and the settlement is ongoing, so I won't comment. I think it's inappropriate to comment at this time. But given the tone of your question, I think it's really important, and we've had a long history, quite frankly, up partnering with Blue in addition to working with them on accounts that are in our service areas, part of the seeding process. And so, we expect that to continue, expect, obviously, to offer the capabilities that we have.  Pete just shared with you what we're doing with IngenioRx. We also think our diversified business capabilities are going to be incredibly important. Some of our Digital Platform capabilities that we've also offered to other Blues. So I can't really comment on where we are in terms of that litigation because it's not finally settled yet, but we feel that there's a significant amount of opportunities for us even outside of this settlement to worked with Blue partners across the country. Thanks to question and next question, please. Ralph, thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick, who's leading our Commercial businesses also, they've been intimately involved in these, to respond to your questions. Please, Morgan. And one last thing, Ralph. You asked the question about anything distinctive about the individual relative to COVID, and I would say no. I mean, our individual business has performed in line. So across the board, we saw -- as John shared, higher COVID spikes in commercial -- individual is not unique or distinct that we feel that we're appropriately positioned in that market. Next question, please. Thanks for the question, Lisa. I think it's actually a really important one as we think about the next-generation of where products are going to go. One of the things that's happened is the pandemic has really highlighted the need for these virtual care services. We shared with you quite some time ago, our JV with Hydrogen Health, and we've been in the market actually working closely with our partners to deliver those services, particularly best-in-class urgent and care, primary care, using chat and texting. What we're talking about now is, I'll call it the next-generation of virtual primary care.  We've gotten some experience in our early entree with virtual care over the last year, and now we're continuing to evolve that. So we did launch as I shared in my remarks, this virtual first services. Think what's interesting and unique about this is they're integrated with our high-performance network, and that's really important. And we're seeing a lot of traction in our high-performance network. And I know we've shared previously, our high -performance network has anywhere from 12% to 15% cost structure differential. And as you think about virtual primary care added to that, we expect those to be the starting point of what we can gain traction on.  So I'm really encouraged by this initial launch. We can -- we're going to continue to, I think, innovate and evolve from that. In terms of where we are doing it, we are working in our Blue states. We're in most of our markets right now. We have offerings not in every county, but we're going to continue to expand that as we certainly learn about it, look at the alignment. A lot of this does, as I said, rely on our high-performing networks and our ability to use both virtual care as well as our high -performing network. And just to give you a sense of what it is, I mean, we're looking at the offerings to cover virtual visits with the $0 copay simplified plan designs, 24 by 7 service to leverage the network. Value-based contracts are at the core of this to drive that cost structure differential. And again, we would expect at least 15% below traditional products. But again, that's a starting point. We're going to gain experience with this. And there's been a lot of interest. We've seen a significant amount of interest. We've offered it first in our fully insured risk-based business and now our national fee accounts are interested in embedding this in their offerings. And as you heard, I think from my opening comments and then what Morgan said, we've had one of our strongest ever national account-selling seasons. And again, I do credit the innovation we're bringing around digital to the success we're having there, and just a fundamentally strong differentiated cost structure really driven by high -performance networks. But thanks for the question. We are -- we're excited and optimistic about how we think that this can drive future trend and future opportunities for our clients. So again, more to come on this, but you'll be hearing a lot more about it in the coming months as we gain more traction with our employers. So thanks for the question. Next question, please. We can. Thank you. Next question, please. I'll ask Morgan to address that. Thank you. Next question, please. Great. Thank you. I'll offer a quick comment and then I'll ask Pete to to comment on that because it fits within our Diversified Business Group. But overall, we know that there has been significant need for behavioral health. And what I want to just touch on briefly is the tight that Morgan said to Whole Health. And we -- Beacon has always been a very strong player in the Medicaid space. And we're continuing to integrate it into our overall government business, but it's got a big upside in the commercial space. And maybe, Pete, some early commentary from what you're saying. Thanks, Pete and the only thing, I guess I would add is you think about the commercial markets, that next-generation of EAP services in area that we are highly focused on. And you've heard us share our strategy about sub-segment market within the commercial business. So we see it clearly in the employer space expansion student space to military services space where we see the demand and need for behavioral health services dramatically increasing as a result of the pandemic. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question, please. Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Thanks for the question, David. A couple of things, I think you hit on many of the core drivers. First and foremost, as we've said, because of the density that we have in our markets, we believe that investing in partnerships makes the most sense because we believe we can drive better membership, better stars ratings, and with 1 out of 8 patients being an Anthem member, the density of working with those providers provides us a good return. And also remember, we can participate in the profit stream s there by embedding some of our DBG assets, or our other assets around Interior and so, it's not that we're walking away from participating in those profit streams. We actually think we have a much more capitally efficient use by investing, partnering, and then pulling through the other assets that we have invested in.  And so that's the core of our strategy and it worked really well and we're continuing to accelerate that strategy. And as I shared, we expect to have 70% in value-based arrangements, 30% in full capitated arrangements. It's a big driver for our Medicare Advantage business. Quite frankly, all of our benefits businesses are going to have an opportunity there. In terms of other areas that we're investing and we've said that we really want to transform ourselves and part of that transformation is building this digital platform for health. The opportunities are inside of Anthem as well as with our Blue partners and we see again opportunities to commercialize that.  That's going to be over the next several years, one of the reasons they elevated Rajeev Ronanki who has been leading this area, is to really explore those opportunities. Again, we've been doing that inside of the Anthem, but we think there's an opportunity with our partners to do more. Areas around Sydney, for example Sydney Health, which is gaining great traction, our Health OS, which we think could be a broader opportunity for the Health ecosystem. We've done quite a bit of investment in Stars and heat is quality improvement in AI and analytics, digital therapeutics. So there's a broad range of things around the digital capabilities and ecosystem we're building. But in terms of the value, again, we look at the most efficient way to deploy our capital, where we have our strength, which is the density in the markets we serve, and how it fills I think our strategy and then how we pull through Ingenio, DBG, and other services, which really are not -- those are still immature in the sense that we haven't pulled them through to the potential that they have and excited about Pete 's leadership there, given his understanding of both commercial and the government business and the opportunities that exist. But thanks for the question. Again, we think it's a really strong future growth opportunity for us. Next question, please. Next question, please. I was going to ask Felicia to respond on your MA questions first and then we'll have John. Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question, please. Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of the overall, our past year, we have had a cost structure advantage in a cost structure advantage. But as you heard in my comment, given our market density, we are moving heavily towards value-based payment. I mean, that is at the core of our strategy. So that's an alignment of working with care providers in a much different way.  And again, we believe both the investments we're making in primary care, the investments we're making in downstream homecare, other things through our Diversified Business Group, IngenioRx that we have an opportunity to bring those assets together uniquely. And then, leverage the density, originally, in our Commercial business, but now our Medicaid business and our Medicare Advantage business, so we feel we've made really good strides on that and we actually see a better alignment with care providers than we've ever had in the past. So quite frankly, I'm optimistic about where we're heading, and I think that that really is the core of our strategy. So thank you for the question and next question, please. Thanks. Thank you for the question, Whit. Certainly during this heart of the pandemic, where non - COVID utilization dropped significantly, and we also wanted to be a very thoughtful participant in what was happening. We did a number of waiving of cost shares as you know, it was part of our response across all of our businesses. As we headed into 2021, those normal -- I'll call it normal course, came back into play mostly because non - COVID utilization returned back to normal levels in many instances in total and there weren't significant drops. So from that perspective, we're following the policies that we have across the board right now and then heading into 2022. Thanks for the question. Next question. Yes, thanks for the double question. The first one around the labor market, clearly across all labor markets, people are seeing pressure on the ability to get employment levels up to where they need to, and then there is some pressure. In terms of our negotiated contract, we do those over three-year cycle and we're also very focused, again, on value-based payments. So I think the big opportunity is to move away from individual unit costs increases, which has been the historical, I guess, trend in the industry to really bundling value-based payment, paying for episodes and procedures.  And that's really where we've been. So at this stage, what I'd say is look, we're always in a dynamic environment in terms of our negotiation, but we feel we factored that into how we're looking at the forward view of everything that's going on, and we just see the biggest opportunity is not just only managing unit costs, but really managing value and part of the value-based payments because there is a much better alignment of taking -- doing the right services at the right time, and that's our view. But in terms of our forward review, again, we're taking into consideration everything. And again, many of our largest contracts are on a 3-year basis, so not all of them obviously are in play right now. Thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Felicia to talk a little bit about our annual enrollment period, which I think was your second question. Thank you Felicia, and thank you again for your interest in Anthem. As we close the call, I want to recognize our associates. This continues to be a challenging year, each day they step up and they step out to live our mission and values and serve our members and communities with care and compassion. I'm impressed and grateful for what they do all the time. We work hard to create a culture at Anthem where everyone feels valued and their contributions make a difference, so I'm particularly proud to see us recently named among America 's 100 great places to work, and healthiest 100 workplaces. I'll leave you with this.  There's increasing opportunity for Anthem to offer elevated personalized experiences as we holistically address what our society needs to be and stay healthy. We're building for tomorrow and beyond, evolving the business to be more digital, moving fast, thinking differently, and operating with discipline. Personally, I'm extremely optimistic for our future. Thank you."

I'll say, Scott, that at the end of the day, the additional contracts that Gail referenced, we're certainly pleased with the opportunity to add those to our business for 1/1/22. They are not going to be material drivers of their own. But what they do is that they represent the ability for us to continue to penetrate that pipeline that we have with our Commercial customers. So as you know, our strategy has always been to be able to penetrate the inherent commercial pipeline that we have so that we're able to keep members Blue for life. And what we've done in terms of that third quarter is to have a very robust pipeline that gives us some very nice sized groups, certainly much smaller than anything you've seen around city of New York or anything else, but they are not going to be material drivers in bit, I would say, very closely with what we consider the sweet spot when we look at the opportunities to grow MA going forward.  We still consider this a very strategic asset for us in being able to grow that business as we go forward. Once again, we are very poised to deliver on the launch of the City of New York business for 1/1/22, and are certainly pleased with the opportunity to be able to continue to support New York retirees, who have been customers for Empire for a long period of time. So this is another, I would say, affirmation of our strategy around what we're doing with respect to group MA business. And additionally, the pipeline for this business remains strong as we head into 2023. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to talk about the dilution. Yeah. Good morning, Frank, and thank you for the question. If you know, we're in the early days of the annual enrollment period, and we're actually very pleased with what we've seen so far with respect to how we are positioned competitively in terms of our benefits in the plans that we're offering, and feel that we'll be able to produce another year of double-digit growth in our individual Medicare products. I'll say we're especially pleased with our supplemental benefits, our over-the-counter offerings. These are the things we call our essential extras, everyday extras. We give members an opportunity to choose from a portfolio of benefits that allows them to address during these, particularly the social drivers of health. The other thing I will say is that we are also pleased with how we are positioned with respect to our [indiscernible] products, where we have a very strong value proposition considering our deep knowledge and experience between Medicare and Medicaid, and being able to serve chronic and complex populations. So when we think about where we are today, a little bit less than 5 days in, we feel good about our positioning and look forward to having a very successful AEP."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $6.79, an increase of approximately 62% year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all of our businesses. This growth was a result of focused execution against our strategic priorities despite a challenging backdrop created by another surge in COVID. Our third quarter results once again, demonstrate the balance and resilience of our core benefit businesses, and the strong growth momentum we are producing across the board. We ended the quarter with 45.1 million members, growth of 2.4 million lives year-over-year, or 5.7%, including growth of 730,000 during the quarter, led by the successful launch of our Healthy Blue Medicaid plan in North Carolina. In addition to the 426,000 members gained in that state, we produced incremental organic growth of nearly 380,000 members during the quarter, driven by strong growth on our Medicaid and commercial risk-based businesses. This growth was partially offset by continued in-group attrition in our group fee-based business, consistent with our expectations. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $35.5 billion, an increase of 16% versus prior-year quarter, and nearly 18% on a HIF adjusted basis. The increase was driven by higher premium revenue associated with strong membership growth in our Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial risk businesses, as well as rate increases to cover cost trends, and ongoing momentum in our diversified service businesses, including in IngenioRx.  The benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.7%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Excluding the impact of the HIF, our medical loss ratio would have decreased by approximately 50 basis points, driven by an unfavorable rate adjustment in our Medicaid business in the third quarter of 2020. All in, the cost of care was above what we would consider to be normalized or baseline levels in the third quarter of this year, driven by higher COVID cost in the month of August and September. But medical costs were nonetheless better than we had expected for the quarter overall, With lower non COVID utilization helping absorb the higher-than-expected COVID related cost. Our third quarter SG&A ratio was 11.1%, a decrease of 620 basis points from the 17.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to charges we took last year related to business optimization and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association litigation settlement.  Excluding charges from the base year, and the impact of the repeal of the health insurance tax, our SG&A ratio would have decreased by approximately 130 basis points, driven by leverage associated with growth and operating revenues. Partially offset by higher spending to support our growth and our transition to becoming a digital enterprise for health. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $2.5 billion- or 1.7-times net income. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9%, down approximately 100 basis points from the 39.9% as of the end of the second quarter. The decrease was driven by growth in shareholders equity associated with our earnings in the quarter and a reduction in commercial paper outstanding.  We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves, given the ongoing uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in lengthening in cycle times that we have seen since the pandemic began. We ended the third quarter with 46.8 days in claims payable, a decrease of 1.3 days compared to the second quarter, and an increase of 5.7 days as compared to the prior year quarter. The timing of our acquisition of MMM inflated days and claims payable in the second quarter, and drove the sequential change. Excluding timing-related impacts associated with the acquisition, our days and claims payable would've increased by 0.2 days sequentially. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.85 from greater than $25.50, putting us at the high-end of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%.  Please note that this guidance continues to reflect the total COVID and non - COVID costs combined, exceeding baseline in every month of the fourth quarter and assumes a similar overall net headwind from COVID for the year relative to our prior guidance. Given significant outperformance in the third quarter on our investment income line, we have increased our full-year outlook for investment income by $100 million to approximately $1.2 billion, which is 260 million above our initial outlook of $940 million. Much of the outperformance in this area stems from stellar results in our alternative investment portfolio year-to-date that we would not expect to recur. Accordingly, we believe that there is at least $200 million of non-recurring upside in the investment income line that should be removed when assessing the appropriate base for earnings growth for 2022, equating to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share in 2021 and implying a baseline for growth entering 2022 of $25.20. Most importantly, our businesses are performing well with strong growth momentum that we expect we'll carry into 2022. Although we will not provide specific guidance for next year on this call, I would now like to shift focus to the tailwinds and headwinds that we are considering into next year starting with the tailwinds. Recall that our 2021 guidance continues to embed a significant net headwind related to the effects of COVID.  While it is too early to declare how much of the overall net headwind, we will be able to earn back in 2022, we do believe that we will recover a portion of it resulting in a year-over-year tailwind. Based on our strong competitive positioning, we expect another year of double-digit membership growth in our individual Medicare Advantage membership. We also expect strong growth in our Commercial membership, aided by what is shaping up to be the strongest national account selling season in the history of the company. We expect accretion from the annualization of earnings of our acquisitions of MMM and myNEXUS. And we expect an EPS lift from our share repurchase program, which was opportunistic during recent periods of volatility in our stock price. Our tailwinds will be weighed against known headwinds and these include the dilution associated with the first year of operations of our new Group Medicare Advantage contract serving New York City's retirees, which we continue to expect will launch on January 1st, as well as dilution related to the startup and launch of our new Medicaid contract in Ohio, which we expect to begin on July 1st, 2022.  In addition, the resumption of Medicaid eligibility re-determinations, assuming a return to a more normal operating environment, and finally, the non-recurrence of the upside in the investment income line this year that I had described earlier. Based on what we know today, we believe our tailwinds will largely offset our headwind, enabling us to reaffirm our commitment to growth and adjusted earnings per share of at least 12% in 2022 after adjusting for the portion of investment income that we have identified is non-recurring. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call when we will discuss our 2022 outlook in more detail. In closing, we continue to execute against our strategic growth priorities, and are pleased to have delivered another quarter of strong growth and continued reinvestment in our business, all while maintaining a solid balance sheet given the ongoing uncertainties associated with the pandemic. And with that, Operator, please open the line to questions. Good morning A.J. and thank you for the question. Associated with the headwinds and tailwinds, of course, we do want to look at them in their entirety but we should think about the potential variability, COVID has the absolute most uncertainty of any line item on there. I mean it's been an incredible situation that we've been through as a country since March of 2020 and COVID continues to have uncertainty associated with it. The New York group retiree business are still going through their enrollment process so we don't have the absolute exact number of lives lined up at this point in time. And so there's some variability there. But you are correct. We do have some pretty good line of sight on most of the rest of them. But COVID is clearly the lion's share of uncertainty at this point. Yes. Thanks Justin, I appreciate the question. In terms of the jump off point for 2022, you are correct. We've quantified our investment income, outperformance for the year. We believe that there is at least $200 million that's unlikely to recur. And so that $200 million equates to approximately $0.65 of earnings per share. And then you take that off of our updated guidance, and we believe the appropriate jump off point for 2022 growth is $25.20. So appreciate the opportunity to clarify that.  Associated with the various lines of business, the commercial profitability, they're still very, very good. However, commercial had the surge of COVID in August and September was really more significantly pronounced within the commercial line of business than it was in the other two lines of business. We took the opportunity to reserve prudently within the commercial line for that spike and to build commercial reserves as a result of what we're seeing at that point in time. Fortunately, non - COVID came in much lower in September across all lines business, which allowed our quarter to come out in a really, really good place. Medicare was very much consistent with expectations.  Medicaid was actually a little bit better than expectations for the quarter. And just as a reminder, we had guided to be above baseline costs for COVID and non - COVID combined for each of the 3 months in the third quarter and we were. We were just ended up being better than our expectations. But the commercial issue was really had to do with the spike in August associated with COVID. Thank you for the question. Yes, sure, Gary. Thank you for the question. So let me see if I can address these appropriately. With the special enrollment period and the exchanges, we have talked about the fact that exchanges are a nice strategy of ours. We're being very, very prudent in terms of our approach. We're going from having I think just a little bit over 70% of our counties covered, just over 80% of our counties covered next year. And we do expect some nice membership growth associated with the individual. But I would say that is all captured in just our core underlying growth in the fundamentals of the business performing extremely well.  We expect all of our businesses to grow, and the individual is no different. In terms of the Medicaid in the redeterminations, the headwind that we referenced really has to do with Medicaid membership, but this is my opportunity to again talk about the balance and resilience of our membership and our catcher's mitt. And we may be able to turn that headwind into a tailwind depending on where those folks go. We do believe that once redeterminations start, that we will be able to maintain a significant amount of that membership within an Anthem product. We offer a product for every American in every situation, young, old, rich, poor, sick, healthy. We have a product for all of them.  And right now, there is a significant number of members within our Medicaid plans. And after redetermination occurs, Medicaid may shrink a little bit, but that means that there's really some significant growth opportunities in other lines of business. I didn't spike it out specifically because we think it's a driver and we could actually turn a headwind into a tailwind. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question Ricky. And maybe I'll talk a little bit about the fourth quarter and then turn it over to Morgan to talk a little bit more about 2022. But in terms of the fourth quarter, our expectations and our guidance are that the COVID and non COVID combined will continue to be above baseline each month in the fourth quarter. So obviously the entirety of the fourth quarter being above baseline. We are seeing very good trends, as I stated we had the spike in August, it started to decline coming into September, non COVID utilization was lower in September than we had expected. October is relatively close to expectations at this point, but there's a lot of uncertainties in the fourth quarter.  The Delta variant is still out there, and we want to be very respectful for it, as well as any other new variants that may or may not exist. And we are expecting an increase in testing, an increase in some of the vaccinations and booster shots, especially with the kids. It's unclear right now exactly when the 5-year - old will be eligible for vaccination, but we want to make sure that we're cautious in terms of our guidance associated with that cost structure as well. And as you -- I'm sure you already know, the fourth quarter just on a normal basis has a higher seasonality in terms of MLR. And so, that's obviously factored in as well. But I'd say, at the end of the day, we've been very cautious and very prudent in our fourth quarter expectations with combination of COVID and non-COVID combined being above baseline. Morgan. Sure, Kevin. I'll see if I can start out and respond to your questions. But in terms of the redetermination, we're really taking a look at where we think these members are going to go and there's been a lot of other studies out there that we think are relatively credible. But we believe that by the end of next year, and that assumes that redeterminations do start to occur maybe late, early second quarter of 2022, that will still have a good 35% of those folks would still be maintained on the Medicaid rolls. We're looking at about 45% of them going back into employer-sponsored plans, and that would take the -- about 20% being eligible for subsidized coverage on exchanges.  And as I stated, we have products and all those things, and we expect to keep and maintain our fair share. So we feel very good about our opportunity and our ability to keep the membership within an -- the Anthem family over the course of next year. And then as it relates to the Medicaid pricing, we learned a lot a few years ago in terms of working with states being very proactive and ensuring that we're having actuarially - justified rates, and we'll certainly continue to do that. It's very early in the ratings season, but we're comfortable with what we're seeing to-date and building our financial plan with prudent assumptions that we believe are well supported. And the states are very -- say we're having some very productive conversations with the states as well about ensuring that we get actuarially - justified rates throughout the future. The only other thing I'll say about the Medicaid is there are a lot of financial measures that are in place now that -- far more than used to be in place in terms of collars, corridors, and things like that. That -- it really helped maintain the profitability and maintain the stability of that marketplace. So really need to look at Medicaid over a long period of time. Thank you, Kevin. Thanks for your question, Steve. In terms of the specificity, I would say that what we saw in September was that inpatient non - COVID probably dropped the most of all of the different buckets that you stated. We don't view any of these things as being changing to the ultimate baseline. There were announcements that were made at the beginning of September that certain facilities were deferring or canceling some elective procedures in order to ensure that there is appropriate bed space. So while certainly we saw the impact on the financials, we do monitor pre-OSP research, various other things, and don't really view that situation as a significant change through the baseline going forward. But thank you for the question. Thank you, Felicia and Scott, I appreciate the question. Unfortunately, this is third quarter call and we're really not going to get into specificity associated with guidance for 2022. We'll talk in more detail about that at the next quarter. And as I said, New York's still going through their enrollment process, so we don't have all the information that quite fine-tuned, but what I would ask you to do is to really evaluate the tailwinds and the headwinds that I provided in their entirety. And then after you adjust for the out performance and investment income, we think that those headwinds and tailwinds pretty much offset each other and will allow us to achieve our 12 to 15% growth for the future. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for that. Thanks for that question. As you referenced as it relates to Ingenio, we're really pleased with the performance. In large part, the performance this year was due to strong membership and volume across the entire portfolio, so all our lines of business. And utilization is also tracking to expectation. So we feel good about that heading into 2022, as well as the growth that I talked about and our focus on penetrating the ASO business. So we feel good about the Ingenio business heading into 2022, the growth and then the stability of the business in terms of its margin contribution."

            "content": "Thanks, Gail. And Ralph, thanks for the question. There was a lot there. And when you talk about your comments about the reductions in the large group business, that's certainly in line with our expectations. We were expecting reduction in our fee-based business. We've had, as you indicated, noted, nice growth on the risk-based business across the segment. Individual, as you've noted, has benefited from a long extending special enrollment period. So we've seen year-over -- month-over-month growth there. Also, when you look at our large group, small group business, we've seen month-over-month growth in sales exceeding lapses. And notably, our large group businesses performed quite well. In fact, 23 of the last 25 quarters, our sales have exceeded lapses. Looking forward into the new year, clearly, it's a competitive geography and competitive market when you look at individuals and HDA. It's one of those that I would characterize it as rational nonetheless. And one that we've -- not inconsistent with our strategies in the past, we take a very disciplined approach. We look at this market-by-market, county-by-county. And in fact, as we expand next year for 2022, we're going to be at 83% of the counties that we can serve. That's up from 71% from the prior year. And this is most notably done by leveraging our unique provider partnerships, leveraging the scale and density we have in our geographies to provide value for the market. Again, the strategy is not a shortsighted one and we're confident the pricing is appropriate on our modeling of our forward trends. So thank you again for the question. Yes, Steve, thank you for the question. And as Gail noted, the national business continues to perform exceptionally well, and also noted there was a bit of a dampening in the RFP activity, it was down. But when you think about it, it was down in numbers of the -- of RFP s, it was up in membership, and Anthem had an exceptionally successful year Up-market did quite well. I think one of the other things that was notably observed is a record number of customers that went out for a -- that went from a multi-partner healthcare solution to a single partner healthcare solution in selected Anthem. And to get directly to your question, to me, we have to earn the right to win every day. And I think when you -- so look at our assets and how they are resonating in the market, you look at the advocacy-based Whole Health digital solutions are winning. When you think about Sydney, Gail mentioned earlier that we have 50 customers that were Sydney Preferred, which is theoretically our digital front door or we could call it our gateway to help. It's the entry point for all the other assets that we deliver. Also, when we think about 23, I mean, these assets continue to be innovated upon, and like I said, it's incumbent upon us to earn this right to when, we don't take it lightly. But the market is loudly voting with their feet and -- so we're excited about where we're headed in '23. Yeah, John, thank you. And, Ricky, thanks for the question. I would -- John covered most of it, I think. I would say, looking next year, it's not indifferent. We remain confident in the approach and our discipline. In consistent with what we've done quarter-over-quarter year-over-year, we're pricing to forward view of trend. Certainly, that's always respectful of market uncertainty. And as John indicated, COVID is going to be around for a while. We've done extensive work to assess various scenarios and how that could play out. But nonetheless, we feel quite confident that way we priced the '22 business. So thank you again for the question."

Gail will begin the call with the brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives and close on Anthem's commitment to its mission. John will then discuss our financials results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Anthem's second quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, ahead of our expectations despite ongoing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver on our commitments to our stakeholders, while making considerable progress against our long-term strategy to transform our organization from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. This transformation is fueled by the continued expansion of our digital platform, which improves connections across the healthcare system, while leveraging the industry's largest data sets to drive actionable insights in pursuit of better health. In the second quarter, Anthem produced strong membership growth, one significant new contract in our government business and continued to integrate and expand our digital platform. On the membership front, we ended the second quarter with 44.3 million members, up 1.9 million or 4.4% year-over-year and 820,000 new members since the end of the first quarter, reflecting the strategic acquisition of Puerto Rico's leading Medicare Advantage organization MMM as well as strong organic growth in our core benefits businesses. MMM is the largest Medicare Advantage plan in Puerto Rico and operates the only 4.5 star rated plans in the territory. And it's also the second largest Medicaid health plan. Through its integrated care delivery model, MMM has established a strong track record of delivering quality care for seniors and dual eligible with complex and chronic needs. Medicare Advantage remains a key area of focus for our organization. And we continue to see an immense opportunity to grow and optimize this business. Just last week, we were awarded a major contract to serve the retirees of the city of New York in partnership with Emblem Health. And what was one of the largest public procurements for group Medicare in the last decade.  This opportunity builds on our more than 50-year relationship serving New York City's workers, retirees and their families and will significantly increase Anthem's group Medicare Advantage business as well as our Medicare Advantage market share in New York. We're honored to have been selected to make a material difference in the lives of New Yorkers who worked hard to serve the city.  In addition to MMM, we also closed on the acquisition of myNEXUS during the second quarter, advancing our strategy to grow and deepen Anthem's capabilities and Medicare Advantage. MyNEXUS is a digitally enabled organization that optimizes home health for more than 2 million Medicare Advantage members across 20 states, including more than 900,000 existing Anthem Medicare Advantage members. MyNEXUS improves outcomes by facilitating timely, personalized care for our members in the comfort of their homes, leading to improved continuity of care and reduced hospital admissions, readmissions and ER visits. In addition to supporting future growth in Medicare Advantage, myNEXUS furthers our diversified business group's strategy to deliver on its risk contracts to the expansion of home-based care.  Our Medicaid business is also performing very well and continues to build upon our deep local alliances and investments in population health, digital tools and local solutions to help address the social drivers of health in our communities. We extended our strong RFP track record in the quarter, securing an award to continue serving consumers in the state of Nevada. This follows our recent award in Ohio. These wins build on the momentum, we have coming off a fantastic start to the launch of North Carolina, which went live at the beginning of this month. Our healthy Blue plan has already become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina, and the leading choice for consumers of beneficiaries who chose their plan; nearly 50% selected Healthy Blue, underscoring the power of our alliance partnerships and the Blue brand.  In our commercial business, together with IngenioRx, we continue to innovate while demonstrating the power of true integration. By deploying machine learning and automation across our comprehensive ecosystem of medical, pharmacy, lab and social drivers of health data, Anthem and IngenioRx are improving outcomes. Across these businesses, we're leveraging our proprietary predictive modeling algorithms to apply rich and analytic solutions that allow us to tailor our integrated medical and pharmacy offerings to each member population. This enables us to deliver the right solutions to improve health based on individualized needs. We extend this customized approach to our specialty products, which we are increasingly selling in bundles through Anthem's Whole Health Connection, a differentiator in the marketplace. This traction gives us confidence in the long-term targets we articulated for our commercial business at our recent Analyst Day, including narrowing the profit gap between our fee and risk based commercial business by serving more of our fee base members in more ways. The success we are seeing in our core business validates our commitment to continue to invest in building our digital platform for health. The essence of a platform is that what we own matters less than what we can connect and we are seeing great success in making connections through consumer and provider facing tools.  While we are still in the early innings, our efforts to simplify the healthcare experience, while creating a more connected and powerful platform are clearly resonating with consumers, providers and employers. For example, over 30% of members registered for Sydney health are actively using the platform. In the second quarter, we continue to expand access to Sydney across multiple Medicaid markets and saw a five-fold increase in engagement compared to our legacy digital tools for Medicaid. In the commercial markets, 32 national accounts have purchased Sydney preferred for its superior end to end experience and enhance functionality like our find care feature, which provides members seeking surgical treatments, a personalized omni channel experience including price transparency, tailored physician and facility recommendations and access to telephonic health coaches to guide them through the process.  Digital is also playing a key role in deepening our value based care penetration and provider enablement by improving conductivity and real time access to meaningful, actionable data. We continue to invest in building enhanced data connections to enable deeper collaboration at scale via our HealthOS provider platform. HealthOS connects siloed health data in disparate technologies to drive deeper insights and reduce costs and complexity. More than 100,000 value-based care physicians and 13,000 value- based care coordinators are connected to HealthOS today. This connection allows technology partners and providers to plug into HealthOS and gain data driven insights as part of their existing workflow. In May, we announced a new partnership with Epic that will allow bi- directional exchange of health information, paving the way to better leverage data driven insights into care decisions. Epic is a significant enabler of many of our efforts to improve our HEDIS and star scores. We have nearly 150 provider systems on our glide path through the end of 2022 and are in discussions with other healthcare information companies for similar partnerships. All of these efforts aligned to Anthem's purpose, to improve the health of humanity. Our community health strategy supports our purpose by addressing the health related social needs of our associates, members and communities, to data and evidence based interventions that promote health equity. Our commitment to living this purpose has earned recognition that I'm particularly proud of, for example, Anthem was recently named one of the top 100 US companies supporting healthy communities and families by Just Capital, the leading platform for measuring and improving corporate performance in the stakeholder economy. We are the leader in our industry, ranking number one among healthcare providers, and number 14 overall on the list. In addition, Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service, recently recognized Anthem as one of the 50 most community minded companies in America for 2021. As we reflect on our achievements this quarter, and our broader mission, we're cognizant that fundamentally improving the health of humanity takes partnerships, aligned incentives and connections across people, care providers, researchers, data scientists, communities, and others dedicated to improving health. Anthem is making these connections through our digital platform for health while following the data and embracing our unique assets to drive positive change in ways that only Anthem can. We have deep local roots in our communities, and the industry's largest data sets, both of which position us uniquely well to deliver against our mission.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail. And good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03. Another strong quarter in which we delivered on our financial commitments, while reinvesting in each of our businesses, all while navigating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Second quarter results again underscored the balance and resilience of our enterprise. We ended the quarter with 44.3 million members, growth of 1.9 million lives year-over-year, or 4.4%, including growth of 820,000 in the second quarter alone. Excluding the acquisition of MMM, we grew organically by 232,000 members in the quarter driven by growth in our Medicaid and commercial fully insured businesses partially offset by continued in group attrition in our large group and national fee based accounts, in line with our expectations and prior guidance. Second quarter operating revenue of $33.3 billion grew 14% over the prior year quarter, on a HIF-adjusted basis; our top line grew nearly 16% with no impact from MMM, which closed at the end of the quarter. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare associated with strong membership growth. In addition to rate increases to cover cost inflation. Pharmacy product revenue also contributed to our top line growth as IngenioRx grew affiliated and unaffiliated revenue, with a value proposition that continues to resonate in the marketplace. The medical loss ratio for the second quarter was 86.8%; an increase of 890 basis points is compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in non-COVID utilization from the press levels a year ago, and to a lesser extent, the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Relative to our expectations, total medical costs were favorable, driven by non-COVID cost developing favorably partially offset by somewhat higher than expected cost for COVID related care. Please note that while total benefit costs were favorable to our expectations, total cost ended the quarter slightly above our estimate of a normalized level. Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 11.5%, a decrease of 240 basis points year-over- year, excluding the effect of the repeal the health, our SG&A ratio decreased 110 basis points, driven by leverage of strong revenue growth, partially offset by ongoing investments in support of our growth and our evolution to become a digital first enterprise.  Turning to our balance sheet; we ended the second quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 40.9%, down sequentially from 41.6% in the first quarter. The decrease was due to the early repayment of debt at par originally scheduled to mature in August of this year, and an increase in equity driven by our strong bottom line performance in the quarter. We continue to expect our debt to capital ratio to end the year, slightly below 40%. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $380.59 for $480 million. We have now repurchased close to 60% of our full year outlook of $1.6 billion, which is still an appropriate figure for modeling purposes. We maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves to the second quarter, ending the period with 48.1 days in claims payable, an increase of 1.2 days compared with the first quarter and 2.1 days year-over- year. MMM and myNEXUS, both of which close during the quarter, increased our June 30th claims payable balances with minimal impact on the average day of claims, resulting in the DCP calculation increasing by 1.6 days. Excluding these acquisitions, days and claims payable was largely consistent with the last quarter decreasing by just 0.4 days. Given the continued uncertainty associated with COVID, we continue to take a prudent posture in establishing reserves. And as a result, our second quarter earnings did not benefit from the favorable prior period development. Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion or 0.9x net income in the second quarter. The year-on-year decline was driven by the deferral of normal tax payments out of the second quarter of last year into the back half as was permitted by the IRS. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow is $4.2 billion or 1.2x of net income. Given our solid performance in the first half, we are increasing our guidance for full year operating cash flow to greater than $5.8 billion. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is depressed this year due to the timing of certain payments, as well as the settlement of the BlueCross and BlueShield multi district litigation scheduled for the fourth quarter. Turning to our earnings outlook for the year, we're raising our guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.50 from the greater than $25.10, which squarely puts us at the midpoint of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%. There are a number of moving pieces associated with our revised guidance, which includes a portion of the upside we generated in the second quarter. The underlying fundamentals of our core business remain strong, evidenced by our first half results. Given strong year-to-date performance on medical costs, we now expect our full year medical loss ratio to end in the lower half of our full year guidance of 88% plus or minus 50 basis points. Given accelerated reinvestment in our business in the first half of the year, and startup costs for new contracts in the back half, we now expect full year SG&A ratio to end the year in the upper half of our prior guidance range of 10.8% plus or minus 50 basis points. We have also increased our outlook for investment income for the year, given strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio in the first two quarters, which we have not carried forward in our guidance. The outperformance in this non-operating line item is more than entirely offset by higher effective tax rate and our full year guidance. In the context of our upwardly revised guidance, we now expect to absorb earnings delusion in the second half associated with the startup cost for the award of the city of New York group Medicare Advantage contract and our entry into the Ohio Medicaid program, both of which will go live in 2022.  We have also taken a slightly more cautious view of the back half of the year, in light of new COVID variants, coupled with a slowing vaccination rate, a combination that could result in the potential for higher COVID related cost. Our guidance also includes a partial year of MMM and myNEXUS, both of which are expected to contribute much more meaningfully to our financial results in 2022 and beyond. As noted in our press release, we now expect to generate approximately $137 billion of operating revenue in 2021. And to end the year with 44.8 to 45.3 million members. Finally, while it is premature to comment quantitatively on 2022, we want to remind you that group Medicare Advantage contracts and large Medicaid wins are generally dilutive in the first full year of operations. We have a strong line of sight towards a compelling ROI on our recent new business wins. And over the seven year term of our new group Medicare Advantage contract with the City of New York, our expect to returns are well in excess of our cost of capital. Additionally, with these two wins, our percent of membership and revenues from our government business division will become an even larger percentage of our totals. In closing, we were pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth while reinvesting in our enterprise. We continue to grow inward in our services businesses, and outward in all of our segments, each of which remains well positioned for growth. Our mix continues to evolve towards our strategic areas of focus, Medicare Advantage and the government business. In addition to our service segments. We have entered the second half with strong underlying fundamentals, solid momentum in a prudently position balance sheet. And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For a first question, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein.\nLanceWilkes: Yes, could you could you talk a little bit about utilization you saw during the quarter in both government and commercial lines and any trends you're seeing with July? And in particular, maybe any distinction between COVID and non-COVID? And how you think the Delta variant might impact that? Thanks.\nJohnGallina: Good morning, Lance. And thank you for the question. This is John. So in terms of the utilization of the second quarter, the overall utilization was slightly above normalized levels, but slightly less than our expectation. So in total for the company we exceeded baseline, albeit that we were better than what we projected. When you really think about it on a line of business by line of business basis Medicaid had the highest level of deferred utilization. And then certainly, they had some COVID costs, and so Medicaid was below baseline, commercial was slightly above baseline all-in and Medicare Advantage was actually slightly above baseline all-in once you take into account all the other issues associated with the risk score revenues, and the additional payments that were still making on the 3.75% rate increases that existed. So all very much consistent with what we thought 90 days ago, just a little bit better. And as you look at July, we really don't provide mid quarter guidance, per se. But we're obviously monitoring our preop and pre certification data and as a reminder, as I just said, in the prepared comments, we do expect both the third quarter and the fourth quarter to be above baseline each quarter for the rest of the year. So based on everything we've seen so far, July is tracking very consistent with those expectations. So thank you, Lance.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.\nJustinLake: Thanks. A couple of questions on the government side; one, can you give us an update on how much membership you've gotten from, you think you've gotten from re-determinations being delayed? And then how you think about that kind of rolling off as you look ahead to 2022 and beyond. And then you talked about this big Medicare Advantage contract from the city of New York, would be helpful to know, I was just looking on the internet was like it might be a couple 100,000 members. Is that a ballpark estimate there for 2022 on what you might pick up? Thanks.\nGailBoudreaux: Great. Well, thanks for the questions Justin; we will try to tick them off. I'll start first on the city of New York and then Felicia should share some of her insights on the Medicaid business in particular. Thanks again for the question, because first, we're really honored to have been awarded the contract with the City of New York and continue serving these members in the state as we execute on our strategy. This is really, I think, a great proof point for Anthem that we shared with everyone at our Investor Day about our goal to get deeper in each of the sites we serve. This contract gives us that opportunity in a very important state. And it also I think, is a proof point for our goal to convert our existing clients to group Medicare Advantage, so two really strong, I think proof points for the strategy that we've been talking about over the last several years. I think a little bit of background would be helpful on the city in New York; we have served them for more than 50 years.  And we've actually been their medical management vendor of the past five years. So if you think about that, it's really given us a really good strong understanding of the members and their health needs. So it was really for us a great opportunity to provide them sort of the strategic offering and group MA. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that generally these contracts are dilutive in the first full year of operations. The back half of the year, we're going to incur startup costs and with no offsetting revenue, so as we get ready to go live in January of '22. And we're absorbing that in the guidance that we've given you. And as we've noted, in past contracts of this size tend to be diluted as the members transition a group MA. I think the good news is obviously as the medical management vendor we have some insight into these members, but we also need to collect the data to reflect the members acuity and risk scores and ramp up other medical management issues, particularly our value based care provider relationships, and obviously working with our partner Emblem. In terms of overall membership, at this time, it's a little bit early to call, but we believe it'll be over 200,000 lives, there's going to be some variability in that because there is a choice in open enrollment to buy up and do different things. But we think, clearly, it'll be over the 200,000 lives. And as we think about 2022, the guidance and what that means we'll share that later in this year. We're a little early and ahead of that, and we'll address that at the end of the year. But again, I'll just close on this section, that as a seven year contract, we think that it's really positive for us overall. And it really gives us breadth and depth in the market. And beginning in '23, we expected to have a positive impact to our earnings and a really strong and compelling ROI. So with that, I'm going to ask Felicia to address the second part of your question, I guess, which was about Medicaid and re-verification.\nFeliciaNorwood: So good morning, Justin. Our Medicaid enrollment ended the second quarter at about 9.7 million members, that was up 582,000 when you include MMM, so just in terms of our organic growth, 267,000 increase in terms of our Medicaid membership compared to the first quarter of 2021, when you take a look at it all-in, the increase is certainly predominantly due to the continued suspension of re-verifications. And we had a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions in our Florida market as well. As our guidance assumes that re-verifications remain on hold through the end of 2021. And with the renewed public health emergency from the Biden administration on yesterday, we still feel very good about that timeline. With that said, we continue to work very closely with our state partners, and our members, helping them understand re-verifications what it means. And we're going to continue to stay close to that as we look to the end of the year. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse.\nA.J.Rice: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. I just may be asked about Ingenio, looks like it was one of the bright spots in the quarter. Is there any update you can provide as to script trends? I know COVID vaccines as well as just the return of acute scripts seem to be helping and wonder if you saw that. And any comment you could give us on the PBM selling season. I know you were targeting some of your customers; do you have ASO business with long standing relationships, any movement there that you've seen?\nGailBoudreaux: Well, thanks, AJ. I'm going ask Jeff Alter to comments on your questions. But thank you, we felt very strongly about our Ingenio results and think Jeff can share with you some of what's happening inside of the business. Jeff?\nJeffAlter: Thanks, good morning, AJ. Yes, so we, it was a strong quarter, thanks for noticing that. We believe our integrated stories are beginning to take hold in the marketplace. And then the work that we do to make sure that our partners with inside, our Anthem businesses, as well as some of our external partners, are getting the best course of treatment at the lowest possible drug costs. And so, as we see that continuing to resonate in the market, we were enjoying a nice trajectory on our earnings, as well as our growth in script volume, and membership. So it's -- we're in the middle of the selling season, that value story is resonating. We particularly see it an advantage inside the labor and trust segment and the mid market of our commercial business. And again, continue to be strong support for our government businesses, Medicaid and Medicare. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research.\nRobCottrell: Hi, good morning. I wanted to see if you could help quantify what you're thinking the expected COVID kind of all-in number will be this year relative to the previous $600 million expectation. \nJohnGallina: Thank you, Rob and good morning. So as you noted the prior guidance was $600 million headwind. And there's certainly a lot of moving parts behind that estimate. Year-to-date, COVID cost did come in slightly better than expected. Non COVID cost tracking. I'm sorry. COVID came in slightly higher than expected with non-COVID tracking slightly better than expected. So all-in costs are a bit favorable to our outlook in the first half. But there's still a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding COVID in the back half of the year, until we obviously want to maintain a prudent if not cautious posture with respect to our guidance. Yes. So in that context, we believe that the net headwind of $600 million is still appropriate, with a majority of that in the back half of the year. And that's an all-in type of an estimate that includes the impact on our risk scores, the additional fee schedules, the COVID cost, the increase in vaccination, administrative cost all-in so at this point in time, we think $600 million is a reasonable estimate to stay with. Thank you for the question.\nGailBoudreaux: Thanks, John. Only thing I'd add is that's very similar and consistent to what we've guided through throughout the year.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gilson, JPMorgan.\nLisaGilson: Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much. Gail, you mentioned several times today digital as well as virtual Care Initiative. Can you maybe just give us a little more color as we think about virtual care and utilization of virtual care? And, ultimately, how do you see that impacting your medical cost trend?\nGailBoudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. I think a couple things there embedded in that we are, as I shared with you, in the opening comments, particularly around our HealthOS platform, we're really building an integrated platform where we can drive data. So I'll address virtual care in a minute. But I think it's all connected, we're starting with really our deep data insights. And we're connecting that with our care provider network, trying to give them the best information across every point in time. And then we're using that to enable our value based care providers. So I think the core of what we're sharing is that virtual is a component of it. And you saw, not only virtual, but also at home care. We believe that our ability to get to the commitment, we made at Investor Day around getting our trend to CPI is really about the -- I guess I'd say the combination of all of these things. So starting again, with enabling our value based providers providing data at real time, and connecting that to consumers through our Sydney platform. So we accelerated a lot of those initiatives over the past year, particularly in the second quarter, you heard the proof point that we just shared about our Medicaid because we think there's opportunities there as well to accelerate the engagement of our consumers. But fundamentally, this is really about getting our value based payment, and our providers enabled with the data so that they can make the right decisions take greater risk. And we do see that as a critical element of getting to CPI, trended CPI over the next several years. So I think they all come together. And again, virtual care is just part of I think, the continuum of care, including at home care that we're offering our providers as part of the mix of how they best serve patients, where they need to be at the right time. So thanks for the question. I think it's a core element of our strategy. But it's quite comprehensive. It's not only about the digital platform; it's really about value based care. It's about connecting of care providers with consumers, and then enabling the providers to actually get more involved and take more risk along the way and feel confident that they can manage those patients. So thanks again.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays.\nStevenValiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on memberships. So in the prepared remarks, you talked about commercial and specialty enrollment decreasing by 174,000 lives mainly on the fee base side as a result of the economic environment. I know the high level unemployment is still trending favorably as 2021 progresses, and now there's all sorts of noise around for low impact on payrolls. I guess I was just curious to hear more from you guys just color or just around the mechanics of the economic environment leading to that sequentially lower membership and how that sort of plays out for the rest of year. Thanks.\nGailBoudreaux: Well, thanks. We'll have Pete address that as part of the commercial outlook.\nPeterHaytaian: Hey, Steve. No, thanks for the question. And as you alluded to, I mean, enrollment and membership in the quarter really came in as we expected. And again, as you suggested, the themes haven't really fundamentally changed. First of all, I do want to note how proud I am of the team in terms of our performance and execution, as you saw it on the print, we have good year-to-date growth over 100,000 members year-to-date, our sales again exceeded our lapses in our local market business, really strong performance on the fully insured side where we saw sequential growth in the individual small and local large group business so that was very good in terms of what we can control and execute against.  As it relates to your question on the economy. Yes, I mean, that's where we continue to see a headwind, on our fee-based business, and the group changes that continue to put some pressure on us. We are beginning to see things open up a bit. And the pipe had been light in the fee-based business, over the last year, but we are beginning to see that pipe open up as it relates to Q3, and Q4, and then headed into 2022.  We have some good visibility, as it relates to 2022, on the national side of our business. So, we are feeling good about where that stands right now, in terms of the growth headed into 2022. It's a little bit early. We're sort of at the middle to the end of that selling season. But I do feel strongly that based upon the execution of our team, the tools and capabilities, we're using, our engagement with the broker community are focused on affordability that as the economy continues to improve, you will begin to see that membership come back in the back half of the year into 2022.\nGailBoudreaux: Thanks, Pete. I just want to reiterate a couple points that Pete made, because I think they're really important; one, is just our ability to sell more than our lapses. I mean, we've really been consistent over the last year and a half plus. And I think a lot of that goes back to our tools, our products. We've done a lot of work on our sales effectiveness, and that's really resonating in the marketplace, are focused on whole health. And so again, while Pete shared that attrition, still in our fee-based business is something that we're closely watching. We're really pleased with the growth in our risk based business. We've taken a very consistent approach. And we've done well in the markets. And again, it's all about our depth, trying to continue to get keep being deep in those markets and strong national account showing as well this year. And we're very optimistic about our pipeline. So, thanks for that question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Vidal from Stevens.\nScottFidel: Hi, thanks, and good morning. I'm just interested; just I know you're not ready to talk specifically about 2022. But just first, in terms of the proper jumping off point to think about as remodeling would be increased guidance range for EPS be the right number, or are you still thinking about where the prior EPS was in terms of the jumping off point. And then, clearly significant, two contracts that you've got here with New York City, group MA in Ohio, Medicaid, and just thinking if there's a way to potentially just ring fence, how you're thinking about initial dilution in 2022. On that just as we try to sort of model properly thinking about 2022 growth rates? Thanks. \nJohnGallina: Thank you, Scott, for the question. And I completely agree with the very first comment you made, it's premature to talk about 2022 at this point in time. However, related to the specificity in our new guidance is $25.50, which does reflect that $0.40 raise. And we're really very, very happy with the core operating performance of the company, really improving throughout the quarter and throughout the year.  I think what I could say, though, without providing any specifics for 2022, is that the core fundamentals of our business do remain solid, we're very confident in our ability to deliver 12% to 15% annual EPS growth over the long term. However, having said that, there will be dilution in for these big contracts in 2022, it's too early to actually declare that as Gail said, we still don't even know the exact number of members that we have in the city of New York.  And we need to do a lot more work on that. And so, as we get closer to 2022, we'll be in a position to provide additional clarity on our expectations. The only other comment I will make is that, we are incurring various startup cost, and set up and cost here in the second half of '21. And we have already included that cost structure in our thought processes, and then our guidance for the year. But thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies.\nDavidWindley: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. If I look back balance sheet was to the beginning of the pandemic, your DCP depending on the kind of the starting timeframe looks like it's increased anywhere from like 7 to 10 days. I'm wondering, do you expect that over the long term DCP will come back down to the high 30s where it was pre pandemic and what visibility would you need to see that happen? And then, if I could slip in, since nobody else has asked where are your analysis of AduHelm and your thoughts around coverage of AduHelm. Thank you.\nJohnGallina: So, thank you. I'll start with the first question and then I think I would like to address the AduHelm. But, in terms of the dates and claims payable, it was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter as you said up either 7 or 10 days, depending on your starting point, really a ton of uncertainty associated with this environment. And we have to record reserves, consistent with the actuarial standards. And we need to ensure that our methodologies and calculations are very consistent. And as I said that they need generally accepted accounting principles.  Having said that, there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of unknowns that have existed, each and every quarter each and every month, during this entire pandemic. And so, we've tried to be extremely prudent and conservative in our approach, and would expect to have that to continue until, there's a little bit more line of sight into the future. I would say that over time, and over time is a long period of time, it could be a few years, but over time, I would expect our DCPs to go back down.  Now there\u2019s lot of other things that impact the days and claims payable as well. We've talked a lot about our investment in digital. Well, that investment in digital also includes better auto adjudication rates, cleaner claim submissions from providers to us, and that is done better and better and faster and faster. That automatically would reduce the days and claims payable without impacting the income statement by a penny, it would just be better throughput.  And actually, the improvement would be our administrative cost structure could go down simultaneously. So, there\u2019s a lot of variables with DCP. And I would really carry out everyone to say, do not just look at a number, and then think that there's a P&L impact, because you also have rate collars and corridors and impacted et cetera, et cetera. But really the short answer to your question is yes, we do expect it to go down over time as we get a little bit more clarity into the current environment. Thank you for the question.\nGailBoudreaux: Thank you. In terms of your second question, I want to address that because Anthem does recognize that there has been really little hope or choice for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, quite frankly it is a heartbreaking disease for patients, their families, their friends and caregivers. We've been monitoring the development of the drug for over a year, we're closely watching the FDA guidance and all available evidence as it continues to change. And as new information becomes available, we're going to continue to evaluate it with our clinical experts we've had, we've advanced them the FDA guidance and recommendation from others. So it's all really, I think times to the relevant evidence that will become available. We really do appreciate the patience as we can take this due diligence and ensure that it really is the most clinically appropriate use of drugs and therapies for our members. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi.\nRalphGiacobbe: Thanks. Good morning. I guess first just wanting to clarify the commentary. Maybe I misheard it, but sounded like better medical cost performance. But John, I think you said, but overall, our total cost was higher than expectations. So just wanted to clarify that. And then going back to Scott's question sounds like, you don't want to really sort of quantify the dilution for '22. But it sounds like there is startup costs this year. So can you help at all in terms of the magnitude of that in terms of what you're absorbing this year for startup costs around those contracts? Thanks.\nJohnGallina: Ralph, thank you for the question. And I appreciate you asking me to clarify, because if anyone wasn't clear, then I did want to take this opportunity. Our total cost for the second quarter was better than our expectations. Simultaneously, our total costs for the second quarter were above baseline or a normalized level, given the absence of COVID. So maybe that's where the clarification is necessary. So we're above baseline for the quarter, but better than overall expectations, and that's one of the reasons our medical loss ratio is at the very low end of the guidance range as well. And then associated with the City of New York startup costs, the Ohio startup cost, we're really not going to go through specificity of dollars at this point in time. Since there's a lot of moving parts in our 2021 guidance. We do have, we closed on MMM and myNEXUS, which certainly includes some financing costs, deal costs and integration costs on for those entities. We have the startup costs for New York GRS as well as Ohio; we've taken all that into consideration. And it's all been thought through in terms of our $25.50 guidance. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo.\nStephenBaxter: Hey, thanks for the question. Wanted to ask one on Medicare Advantage. Just wanted to ask about your current expectations for risk adjustment revenue in 2021. And then get a sense of how the company is feeling about revenue recovery for 2022. And then as we think about, MMM, is there anything we should be keeping in mind here about any dynamics they might have versus the rest of your portfolio? Thanks.\nGailBoudreaux: Felicia?\nFeliciaNorwood: Good morning and thank you for that question. We've engaged in significant outreach this year, with our members really checking in to see how they were doing helping to address health related social need, making sure that they were getting vaccines, and that they're able to see their doctors and access care, especially to close gaps in care that were lingering from 2020. This includes home visits and telehealth, really meeting members where they are and how they feel most comfortable engaging with their care providers. Based on our analytics, we feel very good about where we are, and believe that we are on track to help our members health risks reflected in our 2020 payments at levels that are similar to 2019. And in terms of the CMS make your payment. I wanted to make sure that you know we've received that. And it's certainly in line with our expectations. So we feel good about where we are around risk scores, collecting the data, making sure that we are having coding accuracy appropriately. And as I said before, the '22 payments will be similar to what they were in 2019. And just want to make sure I corrected that. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets.\nMattBorsch: Yes, if I could just ask about a little bit more about utilization patterns. So in Medicare Advantage in the second quarter, you made reference to the impact of the risk score issues, but were the utilization, the elective procedures and so forth were that above your sort of normal baseline? If I understood you correctly.\nJohnGallina: Oh, yes. Thanks, Matt. Maybe I can help answer that question. So in the second quarter, we saw that the inpatient was still below baseline, ER utilization is still short of baseline. However, doctor's visits and outpatient were a bit above. And part of that at our encouragement, we're trying to encourage our members to seek health care when they need it, paying their checkups, and their annual visits, and various things like that. And as you know, more often that the seniors going to see the doctor, the better opportunity there is for us to collect data and information on them to help maximize the risk or revenues. So part of our strategy was consistent with that, to ensure that our members actually saw it and got the care they needed. And we're seeing that. So yes, we did see outpatient and doctor's visits above baseline for the quarter. And we're actually pretty happy about that because we think that's a good thing in the long term. So hopefully, that helps.\nGailBoudreaux: Yes, and I just like to add to John's comment, because remember, we've been forecasting that we expected this to be above our normalized level. And again, particularly Medicare, where you have a highly vaccinated population, we looked at what happened in 2020. Again, we're encouraging them, with house visits to come into the doctor's immunizations, preventative care, et cetera. So that's an important part of it. And again, as we've shared, while we're projecting the back half of the year to be above baseline, again, been very consistent with that. We don't see a surge coming just because of some of the utilization constraints within the system. But again, we're very prudent about what's going to happen with the Delta variant. And that's all been part of the guidance that we gave you. So hopefully that helps clarify.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research.\nJoshuaRaskin: Thanks. Good morning. So my question is on the commercial employer preferences as we move into 2022 and I'm curious if you're seeing any impacts from COVID on sort of employer group preference around benefit design, and work from home, any sort of things that are popping up in terms of new apps and then I guess the other would be any impact on your goal to increase that number of products that you sell into individual or specific customer groups.\nPeterHaytaian: Yes, thanks for the question, Josh. We continue to see what we spoke about at Investor Day, real focus on affordability, on ease of use. And that's really been also on behavioral health and advocacy, those are really been, that has been the focus, over the last several months, especially coming out of COVID, as you'd expect, with a greater focus on behavioral health and the needs associated with behavioral health. And the importance of being able to navigate the system and the complexity of the system. And when we talk about around advocacy is really become critically important. And we are selling that value proposition into the marketplace, we're beginning to see that really resonate, as I alluded to before, in talking about our national business, which again, we're about in the seventh inning of that selling season, those are the themes that were selling through, and we're really seeing it resume, we're seeing new account wins come through, and then importantly, and what I'm really encouraged by, is our existing employer accounts are also growing.  And for the reasons, that we stated that we were really being sensitized to these issues, around COVID, and need for advocacy, affordability, and focus on issues like behavioral health. In addition to that, you had mentioned digital and some of the things that we previously talked about that and digitization of our business. And yes, that is also focused, again, looking back to what Gail said earlier about, really leveraging digital in a much greater way, both as it relates to navigating our product portfolio, but then importantly, as it relates to our members and our providers, and having data in the hands of providers at the point of care is really an important point that is also resonating and something that we're trying to sell to.\nGailBoudreaux: Thanks, Pete, and I guess the only thing I'd add, and Pete did a really good job of describing everything. I'll point to sort of the two proof points. One is the Sydney care sales that we've been seeing, particularly in the largest end which usually are the first movers. And it's been all about integration. And we've done really well with our Total Health, Total You, which is really focused on, again, integration and overall between behavioral pharmacy everything. So overall, I think those are, again, the themes and as Pete laid out the major things that are happening in the space. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America.\nKevinFischbeck: Hi. Great, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on the commercial commentary, because we've been hearing this from a couple of other companies as well, that commercial utilization is coming in a little bit above baseline, just kind of figure out whether you can parse that out as far as core utilization versus COVID utilization and whether there's any kind of implications for pricing for next year, and whether you're able to kind of really parse out whether there's an actual trend issue or whether it's simply, timing or COVID costs.\nJohnGallina: Thanks, Kevin. Well, I'll just address the pricing issue head on, and we've said this before, we are going to stay disciplined with respect to pricing, and we're going to price it to forward trend. We said this in 2020. We did that. And we're seeing that come through in 2021. And feel good about our pricing as it relates to what we did in 2020. Yes, you're right; there are a lot of moving pieces and parts. We do have a sophisticated model, we're tracking this stuff, weekly, we talk about this and we take really all the COVID and non COVID impacts into consideration for pricing purposes. So everything that you mentioned, whether or not what, what are vaccination rates looking like the population, in terms of who's receiving vaccines, the upticks and potential, variants, non COVID electives, core utilization, et cetera. All that is being taken into consideration. If you look at some of our public filings, like in the individual business, you will see, that we are pricing in for these COVID impacts, I would say there's variation by geography, and there's variation by product line. So there is complexity to it, but I think we're being very prudent and again, we're going to price the forward trend and be disciplined about pricing going forward.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley.\nRickyGoldwasser: Yes, hi, good morning. Two questions here. One on the MMM acquisition. Can you quantify for us the impact to the benefit for the second half of '21? And then Gail in your prepared remark you talked about myNEXUS about 900,000 of Anthem MA members on it. How long would take to deploy it across your entire MA book? What's the limiting factor there? And can you maybe quantify for us what would be the impact on medical cost?\nJohnGallina: Thank you, Ricky for those questions. First of all, I'll address the MMM, past year results for MMM when you look at it in our consolidated numbers, certainly weighed down by financing cost, integration costs. And also Puerto Rico has a higher tax rate on average than the rest of the US. And so all those things have been taken into consideration. And really, there's not a lot of accretion associated with that for 2021. It's really we expected to be much more meaningful in terms of its contribution in 2022. So as I had stated in the prior question, there's a lot of moving parts for the back half of '21, and a lot of integration and implementation cost. They've all been factored into our $25.50 guidance already. With that, I'll turn it back to Gail.\nGailBoudreaux: Yes, thanks. In terms of your question on myNEXUS, thank you. MyNEXUS, as I shared is really one of the critical elements of our strategy, both inside of Anthem and outside of Anthem. So you think about 2 million lives serve 900,000 inside of anthem, we've deployed it pretty extensively. But there is more opportunity. We're working through our integration plans clearly, as we grow. And some of the new opportunities, we see this as a critical opportunity for us to get care in the home and also have a digital integration. So I think that's really important. But also, it's part of our diversified business group strategy to sell to others, our Blue strategy and other clients that we work with extensively. So I see it both the opportunity to grow inside of Anthem, and that's something we know them well, we really liked the capabilities, obviously, we use 900 -- we have them against 900,000 members. So we see more opportunity there across our businesses, including our duals. And then secondarily, we think there's a really significant opportunity to grow that business outside of Anthem as well. So this one hits kind of both parts of our strategy. In terms of our cost of care, going to the home, virtual value based care, all of those are critical elements of our cost of care strategy. And so again, having a strong in home offering, I think, is a really important part particularly for the senior population. So we see this as having an important part of that piece of it. So thanks for the question. I think it's for us an important building block and an important piece of our overall strategy.\nOperator: For the last question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank.\nGeorgeHill: Hey, good morning, guys. And thanks for taking the question. I guess as it relates to Medicare Advantage and partnerships, you guys have relationships with Agilant and other kind of provider based organizations. I guess can you talk about the appetite to expand and grow those partnerships as a way to contain costs and ensure visibility? And what can -- and as you roll out those partnerships, and cover lives faster, can you talk about how that impacts how you run the MA business as you have better cost visibility?\nGailBoudreaux: Well, thanks for the question. I'll tell start. And then I'll ask Jeff Alter to provide a little more context. I mean, part of our strategy there is, and again, as we think of our value based relationships, working with dense providers in markets that we want to go much deeper in Medicare Advantage; we want to have stronger enablement for them to move up the risk quarter. And so we've picked partners that we think can help us do that, again, we are -- goal is to be extremely deep in the markets we serve. And so we see the capabilities there is really strong and also aligned, again, with the data that we shared, our HealthOS platform, so part of the partnership is not just to do a contracting relationship, but it truly is to integrate with our data, our systems connected to our consumer facing capabilities, and then have the capabilities that we've built, whether it's myNEXUS or other things, help support them and hitting their overall cost goal. So I think it's an important piece and component of our value based strategy. And we see, again, our opportunity to get deeper and grow with these partners is actually a really compelling value proposition for that. So, Jeff, I don't know if you want to make any additional comments about that.\nJeffAlter: Maybe I'll just say that, we believe it is the best way to effectively build a strong value base network for our Medicare partners, and have the ability to bring that data into the Agilant and the [Indiscernible] in the S3, so the world and then have them distribute that down into their network. So that we do this in a one to one to one to many, as opposed to Anthem having to connect to 1000s of smaller primary care practices. This enables our strategy in a much more efficient and expeditious way.\nGail Boudreaux: So thank you for that question. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us for this morning's call. As you can see, Anthem has shown solid growth throughout this pandemic. While we continue to provide critical support and resources to our communities as we combat the pandemic together. Our performance in the second quarter gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth prospects and deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Our success would not be possible, however, without the hard work and dedication of our more than 87,000 associates, who truly exemplify our mission, vision and values. And I want to thank each and every one of them for everything they do each and every day. Thank you all for your interest as well in Anthem, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11 AM today, through August 20, 2021.

            "content": "Thanks, good morning, AJ. Yes, so we, it was a strong quarter, thanks for noticing that. We believe our integrated stories are beginning to take hold in the marketplace. And then the work that we do to make sure that our partners with inside, our Anthem businesses, as well as some of our external partners, are getting the best course of treatment at the lowest possible drug costs. And so, as we see that continuing to resonate in the market, we were enjoying a nice trajectory on our earnings, as well as our growth in script volume, and membership. So it's -- we're in the middle of the selling season, that value story is resonating. We particularly see it an advantage inside the labor and trust segment and the mid market of our commercial business. And again, continue to be strong support for our government businesses, Medicaid and Medicare. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll just say that, we believe it is the best way to effectively build a strong value base network for our Medicare partners, and have the ability to bring that data into the Agilant and the [Indiscernible] in the S3, so the world and then have them distribute that down into their network.

            "name": "PeterHaytaian",
            "content": "Hey, Steve. No, thanks for the question. And as you alluded to, I mean, enrollment and membership in the quarter really came in as we expected. And again, as you suggested, the themes haven't really fundamentally changed. First of all, I do want to note how proud I am of the team in terms of our performance and execution, as you saw it on the print, we have good year-to-date growth over 100,000 members year-to-date, our sales again exceeded our lapses in our local market business, really strong performance on the fully insured side where we saw sequential growth in the individual small and local large group business so that was very good in terms of what we can control and execute against.  As it relates to your question on the economy. Yes, I mean, that's where we continue to see a headwind, on our fee-based business, and the group changes that continue to put some pressure on us. We are beginning to see things open up a bit. And the pipe had been light in the fee-based business, over the last year, but we are beginning to see that pipe open up as it relates to Q3, and Q4, and then headed into 2022.  We have some good visibility, as it relates to 2022, on the national side of our business. So, we are feeling good about where that stands right now, in terms of the growth headed into 2022. It's a little bit early. We're sort of at the middle to the end of that selling season. But I do feel strongly that based upon the execution of our team, the tools and capabilities, we're using, our engagement with the broker community are focused on affordability that as the economy continues to improve, you will begin to see that membership come back in the back half of the year into 2022. Yes, thanks for the question, Josh. We continue to see what we spoke about at Investor Day, real focus on affordability, on ease of use. And that's really been also on behavioral health and advocacy, those are really been, that has been the focus, over the last several months, especially coming out of COVID, as you'd expect, with a greater focus on behavioral health and the needs associated with behavioral health. And the importance of being able to navigate the system and the complexity of the system. And when we talk about around advocacy is really become critically important. And we are selling that value proposition into the marketplace, we're beginning to see that really resonate, as I alluded to before, in talking about our national business, which again, we're about in the seventh inning of that selling season, those are the themes that were selling through, and we're really seeing it resume, we're seeing new account wins come through, and then importantly, and what I'm really encouraged by, is our existing employer accounts are also growing.  And for the reasons, that we stated that we were really being sensitized to these issues, around COVID, and need for advocacy, affordability, and focus on issues like behavioral health. In addition to that, you had mentioned digital and some of the things that we previously talked about that and digitization of our business. And yes, that is also focused, again, looking back to what Gail said earlier about, really leveraging digital in a much greater way, both as it relates to navigating our product portfolio, but then importantly, as it relates to our members and our providers, and having data in the hands of providers at the point of care is really an important point that is also resonating and something that we're trying to sell to."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us today for Anthem's second quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03, ahead of our expectations despite ongoing uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver on our commitments to our stakeholders, while making considerable progress against our long-term strategy to transform our organization from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. This transformation is fueled by the continued expansion of our digital platform, which improves connections across the healthcare system, while leveraging the industry's largest data sets to drive actionable insights in pursuit of better health. In the second quarter, Anthem produced strong membership growth, one significant new contract in our government business and continued to integrate and expand our digital platform. On the membership front, we ended the second quarter with 44.3 million members, up 1.9 million or 4.4% year-over-year and 820,000 new members since the end of the first quarter, reflecting the strategic acquisition of Puerto Rico's leading Medicare Advantage organization MMM as well as strong organic growth in our core benefits businesses. MMM is the largest Medicare Advantage plan in Puerto Rico and operates the only 4.5 star rated plans in the territory. And it's also the second largest Medicaid health plan. Through its integrated care delivery model, MMM has established a strong track record of delivering quality care for seniors and dual eligible with complex and chronic needs. Medicare Advantage remains a key area of focus for our organization. And we continue to see an immense opportunity to grow and optimize this business. Just last week, we were awarded a major contract to serve the retirees of the city of New York in partnership with Emblem Health. And what was one of the largest public procurements for group Medicare in the last decade.  This opportunity builds on our more than 50-year relationship serving New York City's workers, retirees and their families and will significantly increase Anthem's group Medicare Advantage business as well as our Medicare Advantage market share in New York. We're honored to have been selected to make a material difference in the lives of New Yorkers who worked hard to serve the city.  In addition to MMM, we also closed on the acquisition of myNEXUS during the second quarter, advancing our strategy to grow and deepen Anthem's capabilities and Medicare Advantage. MyNEXUS is a digitally enabled organization that optimizes home health for more than 2 million Medicare Advantage members across 20 states, including more than 900,000 existing Anthem Medicare Advantage members. MyNEXUS improves outcomes by facilitating timely, personalized care for our members in the comfort of their homes, leading to improved continuity of care and reduced hospital admissions, readmissions and ER visits. In addition to supporting future growth in Medicare Advantage, myNEXUS furthers our diversified business group's strategy to deliver on its risk contracts to the expansion of home-based care.  Our Medicaid business is also performing very well and continues to build upon our deep local alliances and investments in population health, digital tools and local solutions to help address the social drivers of health in our communities. We extended our strong RFP track record in the quarter, securing an award to continue serving consumers in the state of Nevada. This follows our recent award in Ohio. These wins build on the momentum, we have coming off a fantastic start to the launch of North Carolina, which went live at the beginning of this month. Our healthy Blue plan has already become the largest Medicaid managed care plan by membership in North Carolina, and the leading choice for consumers of beneficiaries who chose their plan; nearly 50% selected Healthy Blue, underscoring the power of our alliance partnerships and the Blue brand.  In our commercial business, together with IngenioRx, we continue to innovate while demonstrating the power of true integration. By deploying machine learning and automation across our comprehensive ecosystem of medical, pharmacy, lab and social drivers of health data, Anthem and IngenioRx are improving outcomes. Across these businesses, we're leveraging our proprietary predictive modeling algorithms to apply rich and analytic solutions that allow us to tailor our integrated medical and pharmacy offerings to each member population. This enables us to deliver the right solutions to improve health based on individualized needs. We extend this customized approach to our specialty products, which we are increasingly selling in bundles through Anthem's Whole Health Connection, a differentiator in the marketplace. This traction gives us confidence in the long-term targets we articulated for our commercial business at our recent Analyst Day, including narrowing the profit gap between our fee and risk based commercial business by serving more of our fee base members in more ways. The success we are seeing in our core business validates our commitment to continue to invest in building our digital platform for health. The essence of a platform is that what we own matters less than what we can connect and we are seeing great success in making connections through consumer and provider facing tools.  While we are still in the early innings, our efforts to simplify the healthcare experience, while creating a more connected and powerful platform are clearly resonating with consumers, providers and employers. For example, over 30% of members registered for Sydney health are actively using the platform. In the second quarter, we continue to expand access to Sydney across multiple Medicaid markets and saw a five-fold increase in engagement compared to our legacy digital tools for Medicaid. In the commercial markets, 32 national accounts have purchased Sydney preferred for its superior end to end experience and enhance functionality like our find care feature, which provides members seeking surgical treatments, a personalized omni channel experience including price transparency, tailored physician and facility recommendations and access to telephonic health coaches to guide them through the process.  Digital is also playing a key role in deepening our value based care penetration and provider enablement by improving conductivity and real time access to meaningful, actionable data. We continue to invest in building enhanced data connections to enable deeper collaboration at scale via our HealthOS provider platform. HealthOS connects siloed health data in disparate technologies to drive deeper insights and reduce costs and complexity. More than 100,000 value-based care physicians and 13,000 value- based care coordinators are connected to HealthOS today. This connection allows technology partners and providers to plug into HealthOS and gain data driven insights as part of their existing workflow. In May, we announced a new partnership with Epic that will allow bi- directional exchange of health information, paving the way to better leverage data driven insights into care decisions. Epic is a significant enabler of many of our efforts to improve our HEDIS and star scores. We have nearly 150 provider systems on our glide path through the end of 2022 and are in discussions with other healthcare information companies for similar partnerships. All of these efforts aligned to Anthem's purpose, to improve the health of humanity. Our community health strategy supports our purpose by addressing the health related social needs of our associates, members and communities, to data and evidence based interventions that promote health equity. Our commitment to living this purpose has earned recognition that I'm particularly proud of, for example, Anthem was recently named one of the top 100 US companies supporting healthy communities and families by Just Capital, the leading platform for measuring and improving corporate performance in the stakeholder economy. We are the leader in our industry, ranking number one among healthcare providers, and number 14 overall on the list. In addition, Points of Light, the world's largest organization dedicated to volunteer service, recently recognized Anthem as one of the 50 most community minded companies in America for 2021. As we reflect on our achievements this quarter, and our broader mission, we're cognizant that fundamentally improving the health of humanity takes partnerships, aligned incentives and connections across people, care providers, researchers, data scientists, communities, and others dedicated to improving health. Anthem is making these connections through our digital platform for health while following the data and embracing our unique assets to drive positive change in ways that only Anthem can. We have deep local roots in our communities, and the industry's largest data sets, both of which position us uniquely well to deliver against our mission.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. John? Great. Well, thanks for the questions Justin; we will try to tick them off. I'll start first on the city of New York and then Felicia should share some of her insights on the Medicaid business in particular. Thanks again for the question, because first, we're really honored to have been awarded the contract with the City of New York and continue serving these members in the state as we execute on our strategy. This is really, I think, a great proof point for Anthem that we shared with everyone at our Investor Day about our goal to get deeper in each of the sites we serve. This contract gives us that opportunity in a very important state. And it also I think, is a proof point for our goal to convert our existing clients to group Medicare Advantage, so two really strong, I think proof points for the strategy that we've been talking about over the last several years. I think a little bit of background would be helpful on the city in New York; we have served them for more than 50 years.  And we've actually been their medical management vendor of the past five years. So if you think about that, it's really given us a really good strong understanding of the members and their health needs. So it was really for us a great opportunity to provide them sort of the strategic offering and group MA. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that generally these contracts are dilutive in the first full year of operations. The back half of the year, we're going to incur startup costs and with no offsetting revenue, so as we get ready to go live in January of '22. And we're absorbing that in the guidance that we've given you. And as we've noted, in past contracts of this size tend to be diluted as the members transition a group MA. I think the good news is obviously as the medical management vendor we have some insight into these members, but we also need to collect the data to reflect the members acuity and risk scores and ramp up other medical management issues, particularly our value based care provider relationships, and obviously working with our partner Emblem. In terms of overall membership, at this time, it's a little bit early to call, but we believe it'll be over 200,000 lives, there's going to be some variability in that because there is a choice in open enrollment to buy up and do different things. But we think, clearly, it'll be over the 200,000 lives. And as we think about 2022, the guidance and what that means we'll share that later in this year. We're a little early and ahead of that, and we'll address that at the end of the year. But again, I'll just close on this section, that as a seven year contract, we think that it's really positive for us overall. And it really gives us breadth and depth in the market. And beginning in '23, we expected to have a positive impact to our earnings and a really strong and compelling ROI. So with that, I'm going to ask Felicia to address the second part of your question, I guess, which was about Medicaid and re-verification. Well, thanks, AJ. I'm going ask Jeff Alter to comments on your questions. But thank you, we felt very strongly about our Ingenio results and think Jeff can share with you some of what's happening inside of the business. Jeff? Thanks, John. Only thing I'd add is that's very similar and consistent to what we've guided through throughout the year. Well, thanks for the question, Lisa. I think a couple things there embedded in that we are, as I shared with you, in the opening comments, particularly around our HealthOS platform, we're really building an integrated platform where we can drive data. So I'll address virtual care in a minute. But I think it's all connected, we're starting with really our deep data insights. And we're connecting that with our care provider network, trying to give them the best information across every point in time. And then we're using that to enable our value based care providers. So I think the core of what we're sharing is that virtual is a component of it. And you saw, not only virtual, but also at home care. We believe that our ability to get to the commitment, we made at Investor Day around getting our trend to CPI is really about the -- I guess I'd say the combination of all of these things. So starting again, with enabling our value based providers providing data at real time, and connecting that to consumers through our Sydney platform. So we accelerated a lot of those initiatives over the past year, particularly in the second quarter, you heard the proof point that we just shared about our Medicaid because we think there's opportunities there as well to accelerate the engagement of our consumers. But fundamentally, this is really about getting our value based payment, and our providers enabled with the data so that they can make the right decisions take greater risk. And we do see that as a critical element of getting to CPI, trended CPI over the next several years. So I think they all come together. And again, virtual care is just part of I think, the continuum of care, including at home care that we're offering our providers as part of the mix of how they best serve patients, where they need to be at the right time. So thanks for the question. I think it's a core element of our strategy. But it's quite comprehensive. It's not only about the digital platform; it's really about value based care. It's about connecting of care providers with consumers, and then enabling the providers to actually get more involved and take more risk along the way and feel confident that they can manage those patients. So thanks again. Well, thanks. We'll have Pete address that as part of the commercial outlook. Thanks, Pete. I just want to reiterate a couple points that Pete made, because I think they're really important; one, is just our ability to sell more than our lapses. I mean, we've really been consistent over the last year and a half plus. And I think a lot of that goes back to our tools, our products. We've done a lot of work on our sales effectiveness, and that's really resonating in the marketplace, are focused on whole health. And so again, while Pete shared that attrition, still in our fee-based business is something that we're closely watching. We're really pleased with the growth in our risk based business. We've taken a very consistent approach. And we've done well in the markets. And again, it's all about our depth, trying to continue to get keep being deep in those markets and strong national account showing as well this year. And we're very optimistic about our pipeline. So, thanks for that question. Thank you. In terms of your second question, I want to address that because Anthem does recognize that there has been really little hope or choice for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, quite frankly it is a heartbreaking disease for patients, their families, their friends and caregivers. We've been monitoring the development of the drug for over a year, we're closely watching the FDA guidance and all available evidence as it continues to change. And as new information becomes available, we're going to continue to evaluate it with our clinical experts we've had, we've advanced them the FDA guidance and recommendation from others. So it's all really, I think times to the relevant evidence that will become available. We really do appreciate the patience as we can take this due diligence and ensure that it really is the most clinically appropriate use of drugs and therapies for our members. So thank you for the question. Felicia? Yes, and I just like to add to John's comment, because remember, we've been forecasting that we expected this to be above our normalized level. And again, particularly Medicare, where you have a highly vaccinated population, we looked at what happened in 2020. Again, we're encouraging them, with house visits to come into the doctor's immunizations, preventative care, et cetera. So that's an important part of it. And again, as we've shared, while we're projecting the back half of the year to be above baseline, again, been very consistent with that. We don't see a surge coming just because of some of the utilization constraints within the system. But again, we're very prudent about what's going to happen with the Delta variant. And that's all been part of the guidance that we gave you. So hopefully that helps clarify. Thanks, Pete, and I guess the only thing I'd add, and Pete did a really good job of describing everything. I'll point to sort of the two proof points. One is the Sydney care sales that we've been seeing, particularly in the largest end which usually are the first movers. And it's been all about integration. And we've done really well with our Total Health, Total You, which is really focused on, again, integration and overall between behavioral pharmacy everything. So overall, I think those are, again, the themes and as Pete laid out the major things that are happening in the space. So thanks for the question. Yes, thanks. In terms of your question on myNEXUS, thank you. MyNEXUS, as I shared is really one of the critical elements of our strategy, both inside of Anthem and outside of Anthem. So you think about 2 million lives serve 900,000 inside of anthem, we've deployed it pretty extensively. But there is more opportunity. We're working through our integration plans clearly, as we grow. And some of the new opportunities, we see this as a critical opportunity for us to get care in the home and also have a digital integration. So I think that's really important. But also, it's part of our diversified business group strategy to sell to others, our Blue strategy and other clients that we work with extensively. So I see it both the opportunity to grow inside of Anthem, and that's something we know them well, we really liked the capabilities, obviously, we use 900 -- we have them against 900,000 members. So we see more opportunity there across our businesses, including our duals. And then secondarily, we think there's a really significant opportunity to grow that business outside of Anthem as well. So this one hits kind of both parts of our strategy. In terms of our cost of care, going to the home, virtual value based care, all of those are critical elements of our cost of care strategy. And so again, having a strong in home offering, I think, is a really important part particularly for the senior population. So we see this as having an important part of that piece of it. So thanks for the question. I think it's for us an important building block and an important piece of our overall strategy. Well, thanks for the question. I'll tell start. And then I'll ask Jeff Alter to provide a little more context. I mean, part of our strategy there is, and again, as we think of our value based relationships, working with dense providers in markets that we want to go much deeper in Medicare Advantage; we want to have stronger enablement for them to move up the risk quarter. And so we've picked partners that we think can help us do that, again, we are -- goal is to be extremely deep in the markets we serve. And so we see the capabilities there is really strong and also aligned, again, with the data that we shared, our HealthOS platform, so part of the partnership is not just to do a contracting relationship, but it truly is to integrate with our data, our systems connected to our consumer facing capabilities, and then have the capabilities that we've built, whether it's myNEXUS or other things, help support them and hitting their overall cost goal. So I think it's an important piece and component of our value based strategy. And we see, again, our opportunity to get deeper and grow with these partners is actually a really compelling value proposition for that. So, Jeff, I don't know if you want to make any additional comments about that. So thank you for that question. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us for this morning's call. As you can see, Anthem has shown solid growth throughout this pandemic. While we continue to provide critical support and resources to our communities as we combat the pandemic together. Our performance in the second quarter gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth prospects and deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Our success would not be possible, however, without the hard work and dedication of our more than 87,000 associates, who truly exemplify our mission, vision and values. And I want to thank each and every one of them for everything they do each and every day. Thank you all for your interest as well in Anthem, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future."

            "content": "So good morning, Justin. Our Medicaid enrollment ended the second quarter at about 9.7 million members, that was up 582,000 when you include MMM, so just in terms of our organic growth, 267,000 increase in terms of our Medicaid membership compared to the first quarter of 2021, when you take a look at it all-in, the increase is certainly predominantly due to the continued suspension of re-verifications. And we had a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions in our Florida market as well. As our guidance assumes that re-verifications remain on hold through the end of 2021. And with the renewed public health emergency from the Biden administration on yesterday, we still feel very good about that timeline. With that said, we continue to work very closely with our state partners, and our members, helping them understand re-verifications what it means. And we're going to continue to stay close to that as we look to the end of the year. Thank you. Good morning and thank you for that question. We've engaged in significant outreach this year, with our members really checking in to see how they were doing helping to address health related social need, making sure that they were getting vaccines, and that they're able to see their doctors and access care, especially to close gaps in care that were lingering from 2020. This includes home visits and telehealth, really meeting members where they are and how they feel most comfortable engaging with their care providers. Based on our analytics, we feel very good about where we are, and believe that we are on track to help our members health risks reflected in our 2020 payments at levels that are similar to 2019. And in terms of the CMS make your payment. I wanted to make sure that you know we've received that. And it's certainly in line with our expectations. So we feel good about where we are around risk scores, collecting the data, making sure that we are having coding accuracy appropriately. And as I said before, the '22 payments will be similar to what they were in 2019. And just want to make sure I corrected that. Thank you."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail. And good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results that included GAAP earnings per share of $7.25 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.03. Another strong quarter in which we delivered on our financial commitments, while reinvesting in each of our businesses, all while navigating the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Second quarter results again underscored the balance and resilience of our enterprise. We ended the quarter with 44.3 million members, growth of 1.9 million lives year-over-year, or 4.4%, including growth of 820,000 in the second quarter alone. Excluding the acquisition of MMM, we grew organically by 232,000 members in the quarter driven by growth in our Medicaid and commercial fully insured businesses partially offset by continued in group attrition in our large group and national fee based accounts, in line with our expectations and prior guidance. Second quarter operating revenue of $33.3 billion grew 14% over the prior year quarter, on a HIF-adjusted basis; our top line grew nearly 16% with no impact from MMM, which closed at the end of the quarter. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare associated with strong membership growth. In addition to rate increases to cover cost inflation. Pharmacy product revenue also contributed to our top line growth as IngenioRx grew affiliated and unaffiliated revenue, with a value proposition that continues to resonate in the marketplace. The medical loss ratio for the second quarter was 86.8%; an increase of 890 basis points is compared to the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in non-COVID utilization from the press levels a year ago, and to a lesser extent, the repeal of the health insurance tax in 2021. Relative to our expectations, total medical costs were favorable, driven by non-COVID cost developing favorably partially offset by somewhat higher than expected cost for COVID related care. Please note that while total benefit costs were favorable to our expectations, total cost ended the quarter slightly above our estimate of a normalized level. Our second quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 11.5%, a decrease of 240 basis points year-over- year, excluding the effect of the repeal the health, our SG&A ratio decreased 110 basis points, driven by leverage of strong revenue growth, partially offset by ongoing investments in support of our growth and our evolution to become a digital first enterprise.  Turning to our balance sheet; we ended the second quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 40.9%, down sequentially from 41.6% in the first quarter. The decrease was due to the early repayment of debt at par originally scheduled to mature in August of this year, and an increase in equity driven by our strong bottom line performance in the quarter. We continue to expect our debt to capital ratio to end the year, slightly below 40%. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $380.59 for $480 million. We have now repurchased close to 60% of our full year outlook of $1.6 billion, which is still an appropriate figure for modeling purposes. We maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves to the second quarter, ending the period with 48.1 days in claims payable, an increase of 1.2 days compared with the first quarter and 2.1 days year-over- year. MMM and myNEXUS, both of which close during the quarter, increased our June 30th claims payable balances with minimal impact on the average day of claims, resulting in the DCP calculation increasing by 1.6 days. Excluding these acquisitions, days and claims payable was largely consistent with the last quarter decreasing by just 0.4 days. Given the continued uncertainty associated with COVID, we continue to take a prudent posture in establishing reserves. And as a result, our second quarter earnings did not benefit from the favorable prior period development. Operating cash flow was $1.7 billion or 0.9x net income in the second quarter. The year-on-year decline was driven by the deferral of normal tax payments out of the second quarter of last year into the back half as was permitted by the IRS. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow is $4.2 billion or 1.2x of net income. Given our solid performance in the first half, we are increasing our guidance for full year operating cash flow to greater than $5.8 billion. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is depressed this year due to the timing of certain payments, as well as the settlement of the BlueCross and BlueShield multi district litigation scheduled for the fourth quarter. Turning to our earnings outlook for the year, we're raising our guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share to greater than $25.50 from the greater than $25.10, which squarely puts us at the midpoint of our long-term annual adjusted earnings per share growth target of 12% to 15%. There are a number of moving pieces associated with our revised guidance, which includes a portion of the upside we generated in the second quarter. The underlying fundamentals of our core business remain strong, evidenced by our first half results. Given strong year-to-date performance on medical costs, we now expect our full year medical loss ratio to end in the lower half of our full year guidance of 88% plus or minus 50 basis points. Given accelerated reinvestment in our business in the first half of the year, and startup costs for new contracts in the back half, we now expect full year SG&A ratio to end the year in the upper half of our prior guidance range of 10.8% plus or minus 50 basis points. We have also increased our outlook for investment income for the year, given strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio in the first two quarters, which we have not carried forward in our guidance. The outperformance in this non-operating line item is more than entirely offset by higher effective tax rate and our full year guidance. In the context of our upwardly revised guidance, we now expect to absorb earnings delusion in the second half associated with the startup cost for the award of the city of New York group Medicare Advantage contract and our entry into the Ohio Medicaid program, both of which will go live in 2022.  We have also taken a slightly more cautious view of the back half of the year, in light of new COVID variants, coupled with a slowing vaccination rate, a combination that could result in the potential for higher COVID related cost. Our guidance also includes a partial year of MMM and myNEXUS, both of which are expected to contribute much more meaningfully to our financial results in 2022 and beyond. As noted in our press release, we now expect to generate approximately $137 billion of operating revenue in 2021. And to end the year with 44.8 to 45.3 million members. Finally, while it is premature to comment quantitatively on 2022, we want to remind you that group Medicare Advantage contracts and large Medicaid wins are generally dilutive in the first full year of operations. We have a strong line of sight towards a compelling ROI on our recent new business wins. And over the seven year term of our new group Medicare Advantage contract with the City of New York, our expect to returns are well in excess of our cost of capital. Additionally, with these two wins, our percent of membership and revenues from our government business division will become an even larger percentage of our totals. In closing, we were pleased to deliver another quarter of solid growth while reinvesting in our enterprise. We continue to grow inward in our services businesses, and outward in all of our segments, each of which remains well positioned for growth. Our mix continues to evolve towards our strategic areas of focus, Medicare Advantage and the government business. In addition to our service segments. We have entered the second half with strong underlying fundamentals, solid momentum in a prudently position balance sheet. And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions. Good morning, Lance. And thank you for the question. This is John. So in terms of the utilization of the second quarter, the overall utilization was slightly above normalized levels, but slightly less than our expectation. So in total for the company we exceeded baseline, albeit that we were better than what we projected. When you really think about it on a line of business by line of business basis Medicaid had the highest level of deferred utilization. And then certainly, they had some COVID costs, and so Medicaid was below baseline, commercial was slightly above baseline all-in and Medicare Advantage was actually slightly above baseline all-in once you take into account all the other issues associated with the risk score revenues, and the additional payments that were still making on the 3.75% rate increases that existed. So all very much consistent with what we thought 90 days ago, just a little bit better. And as you look at July, we really don't provide mid quarter guidance, per se. But we're obviously monitoring our preop and pre certification data and as a reminder, as I just said, in the prepared comments, we do expect both the third quarter and the fourth quarter to be above baseline each quarter for the rest of the year. So based on everything we've seen so far, July is tracking very consistent with those expectations. So thank you, Lance. Thank you, Rob and good morning. So as you noted the prior guidance was $600 million headwind. And there's certainly a lot of moving parts behind that estimate. Year-to-date, COVID cost did come in slightly better than expected. Non COVID cost tracking. I'm sorry. COVID came in slightly higher than expected with non-COVID tracking slightly better than expected. So all-in costs are a bit favorable to our outlook in the first half. But there's still a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding COVID in the back half of the year, until we obviously want to maintain a prudent if not cautious posture with respect to our guidance. Yes. So in that context, we believe that the net headwind of $600 million is still appropriate, with a majority of that in the back half of the year. And that's an all-in type of an estimate that includes the impact on our risk scores, the additional fee schedules, the COVID cost, the increase in vaccination, administrative cost all-in so at this point in time, we think $600 million is a reasonable estimate to stay with. Thank you for the question. Thank you, Scott, for the question. And I completely agree with the very first comment you made, it's premature to talk about 2022 at this point in time. However, related to the specificity in our new guidance is $25.50, which does reflect that $0.40 raise. And we're really very, very happy with the core operating performance of the company, really improving throughout the quarter and throughout the year.  I think what I could say, though, without providing any specifics for 2022, is that the core fundamentals of our business do remain solid, we're very confident in our ability to deliver 12% to 15% annual EPS growth over the long term. However, having said that, there will be dilution in for these big contracts in 2022, it's too early to actually declare that as Gail said, we still don't even know the exact number of members that we have in the city of New York.  And we need to do a lot more work on that. And so, as we get closer to 2022, we'll be in a position to provide additional clarity on our expectations. The only other comment I will make is that, we are incurring various startup cost, and set up and cost here in the second half of '21. And we have already included that cost structure in our thought processes, and then our guidance for the year. But thank you for the question. So, thank you. I'll start with the first question and then I think I would like to address the AduHelm. But, in terms of the dates and claims payable, it was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter as you said up either 7 or 10 days, depending on your starting point, really a ton of uncertainty associated with this environment. And we have to record reserves, consistent with the actuarial standards. And we need to ensure that our methodologies and calculations are very consistent. And as I said that they need generally accepted accounting principles.  Having said that, there are a lot of uncertainties and a lot of unknowns that have existed, each and every quarter each and every month, during this entire pandemic. And so, we've tried to be extremely prudent and conservative in our approach, and would expect to have that to continue until, there's a little bit more line of sight into the future. I would say that over time, and over time is a long period of time, it could be a few years, but over time, I would expect our DCPs to go back down.  Now there's lot of other things that impact the days and claims payable as well. We've talked a lot about our investment in digital. Well, that investment in digital also includes better auto adjudication rates, cleaner claim submissions from providers to us, and that is done better and better and faster and faster. That automatically would reduce the days and claims payable without impacting the income statement by a penny, it would just be better throughput.  And actually, the improvement would be our administrative cost structure could go down simultaneously. So, there's a lot of variables with DCP. And I would really carry out everyone to say, do not just look at a number, and then think that there's a P&L impact, because you also have rate collars and corridors and impacted et cetera, et cetera. But really the short answer to your question is yes, we do expect it to go down over time as we get a little bit more clarity into the current environment. Thank you for the question. Ralph, thank you for the question. And I appreciate you asking me to clarify, because if anyone wasn't clear, then I did want to take this opportunity. Our total cost for the second quarter was better than our expectations. Simultaneously, our total costs for the second quarter were above baseline or a normalized level, given the absence of COVID. So maybe that's where the clarification is necessary. So we're above baseline for the quarter, but better than overall expectations, and that's one of the reasons our medical loss ratio is at the very low end of the guidance range as well. And then associated with the City of New York startup costs, the Ohio startup cost, we're really not going to go through specificity of dollars at this point in time. Since there's a lot of moving parts in our 2021 guidance. We do have, we closed on MMM and myNEXUS, which certainly includes some financing costs, deal costs and integration costs on for those entities. We have the startup costs for New York GRS as well as Ohio; we've taken all that into consideration. And it's all been thought through in terms of our $25.50 guidance. So thank you for the question. Oh, yes. Thanks, Matt. Maybe I can help answer that question. So in the second quarter, we saw that the inpatient was still below baseline, ER utilization is still short of baseline. However, doctor's visits and outpatient were a bit above. And part of that at our encouragement, we're trying to encourage our members to seek health care when they need it, paying their checkups, and their annual visits, and various things like that. And as you know, more often that the seniors going to see the doctor, the better opportunity there is for us to collect data and information on them to help maximize the risk or revenues. So part of our strategy was consistent with that, to ensure that our members actually saw it and got the care they needed. And we're seeing that. So yes, we did see outpatient and doctor's visits above baseline for the quarter. And we're actually pretty happy about that because we think that's a good thing in the long term. So hopefully, that helps. Thanks, Kevin. Well, I'll just address the pricing issue head on, and we've said this before, we are going to stay disciplined with respect to pricing, and we're going to price it to forward trend. We said this in 2020. We did that. And we're seeing that come through in 2021. And feel good about our pricing as it relates to what we did in 2020. Yes, you're right; there are a lot of moving pieces and parts. We do have a sophisticated model, we're tracking this stuff, weekly, we talk about this and we take really all the COVID and non COVID impacts into consideration for pricing purposes. So everything that you mentioned, whether or not what, what are vaccination rates looking like the population, in terms of who's receiving vaccines, the upticks and potential, variants, non COVID electives, core utilization, et cetera. All that is being taken into consideration. If you look at some of our public filings, like in the individual business, you will see, that we are pricing in for these COVID impacts, I would say there's variation by geography, and there's variation by product line. So there is complexity to it, but I think we're being very prudent and again, we're going to price the forward trend and be disciplined about pricing going forward. Thank you, Ricky for those questions. First of all, I'll address the MMM, past year results for MMM when you look at it in our consolidated numbers, certainly weighed down by financing cost, integration costs. And also Puerto Rico has a higher tax rate on average than the rest of the US. And so all those things have been taken into consideration. And really, there's not a lot of accretion associated with that for 2021. It's really we expected to be much more meaningful in terms of its contribution in 2022. So as I had stated in the prior question, there's a lot of moving parts for the back half of '21, and a lot of integration and implementation cost. They've all been factored into our $25.50 guidance already. With that, I'll turn it back to Gail."

Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today\u2019s press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Anthem\u2019s firsts quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, reflecting growing momentum in our business despite the challenges of the environment. When we came together for this call a year ago, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for health care. Over these last 12 months, I'm incredibly proud of how we've led during a period characterized by uncertainty. From day one, we partnered with local state and federal officials to ensure our members were prepared with the resources and support they need to navigate through the pandemic. In 2020, our associates logged more than 110,000 volunteer hours and more than 17,000 hours so far in 2021, addressing critical issues in their local communities, such as food insecurity, and social isolation. Our efforts have recently shifted from a focus on treatment and testing to vaccinations. We recognize that we play a critical role in the fight against the pandemic, and in ensuring safe and equitable access to vaccines in our communities. Through our multi-channel approach, we've been able to reach nearly two-thirds of our members with information regarding where, when, and how they can access COVID-19 vaccines in their own communities, including coordinating in-home vaccinations for our homebound members, while covering vaccine administration costs for our commercial members with no out of pocket cost sharing. In addition, clinicians at our CareMore and HealthSun clinics have helped thousands of our most vulnerable seniors get vaccinated. I'm incredibly grateful to our associates, who have adapted seamlessly and work diligently through the pandemic to support our consumers. Our focus on health starts with our own associates, and we're committed to empowering them to live a healthy lifestyle. For those who received the vaccine, we're offering a choice of a one-time credit towards their own health care premiums or a donation on their behalf to the Anthem Cares Fund, which provides financial support to Anthem Associates in need. As a company that has been grounded in our local communities for more than 75 years, we have an unwavering commitment to positively influence not only the health of our consumers, but the health of the communities in which we live and work. Membership growth in the first quarter clearly reflects the balance and resilience of our core business, with strong growth in our government business led by Medicaid. With eligibility re-verifications on hold across the country, our organic growth remains robust. Medicare Advantage membership also tracked in-line with our expectations growing [15%] year-over-year through the first quarter.  We're honored to have been selected to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in Ohio, a state where Anthem currently holds the leading commercial and Medicare Advantage market share positions. With the launch of this contract, Anthem will serve consumers across all products in the State of Ohio further underscoring our ability to be a lifetime trusted health partner.  Commercial enrollment grew sequentially to start the year outperforming expectations with growth led by our risk-based business. As expected, commercial membership decreased slightly year-over -year, driven by in-group attrition in our group fee based business. In spite of many national account prospects electing to delay decisions until 2022, we had one of our strongest selling seasons in the past five years. Sales exceeded lapses in our large group fully insured business for the sixth consecutive quarter and for 10 of the past 11. Our success speaks to the strength of our sales team, the value of our innovative solutions, and our commitment to being a valued partner to our customers. Given our solid overall performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $25.10 from greater than $24.50, putting us on track to achieve our long-term 12% to 15% annual adjusted EPS growth target, even as we continue to dedicate resources to combating the pandemic. Looking ahead, our digital solutions will continue to drive growth, and we are fundamentally changing how we leverage technology to deliver the exceptional experiences that consumers expect from us, and to help address health disparities and improve outcomes by sharing insight with care providers. We now have close to 10 million people engaged on our digital channels with access to a wide array of virtual care specialties and resources to help them lead healthy lives. One of our digital solutions, Anthem\u2019s Concierge Care program aims to solve distinct problems for our customers. Our suite of programs universally offers seamless experience for members facing chronic or complex conditions, connecting them with their entire care team on a single centralized platform and allowing them to seek support in real time when it's right for them.  Today, our Concierge Care programs are available to just under 1 million members, with line of sight into tripling enrollment over the next few years. This program integrates remote patient monitoring that shares real time data with care providers at all times. We have also partnered with connected device manufacturers to leverage their capabilities to expand remote care options that allow patients and their clinicians to conduct virtual office visits, culminating and personalized experiences for members\u2019 better outcomes and improved affordability. Our deep roots in our communities and our partnership with local care providers enable us to scale these initiatives in real time with a focus on collaborating across the continuum of care, while ensuring our care provider partners have access to best-in-class digital tools and capabilities to help them deliver better outcomes. Predictive AI and real time access to data, coupled with a growing focus on value-based arrangements with care providers, is enabling us to improve access to high quality, affordable healthcare and facilitate better consumer and physician decision making. The integration of these capabilities is what will enable us to deliver on our commitment to drive commercial medical cost trend down towards CPI by 2025. A goal we shared with you at our Investor Day last month. Earlier this year, we launched the nation's largest high performance network in partnership with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The Blue high performance network is guiding members towards providers who are aligned with our goal of driving greater affordability and improved outcomes. The benefits are compelling, with average savings of 11% and up to 20% in certain markets. Through AI and machine learning, we're also providing members with access to personalized health information to help them make informed healthcare decisions. When searching for providers, most digital tools automatically default to recommending providers based solely on location. Anthem\u2019s smart provider finder on our Sydney Health App gives consumers greater control of their care by taking into account the factors that matter most, such as conditions, specific needs, affordability, and quality. We're intensely focused on enhancing our capabilities aimed at addressing the needs of people with chronic and complex conditions. Our pending acquisition of MyNEXUS combines the power of digital and advanced analytics to expertly manage and coordinate home based health care. Anthem has been a customer of MyNEXUS since 2017 with more than 830,000 of our individual and group retiree Medicare Advantage members currently managed by MyNEXUS. We have seen first-hand the positive contributions MyNEXUS has had on our members\u2019 quality of life, and we look forward to expanding this impact across even more of our members. Equally important, this acquisition provides Anthem with another pathway to managing a greater portion of the overall healthcare dollar. A key strategic pillar of our diversified business group that will allow us to create end-to-end seamless experiences from post acute care to home health, with pathways to services like [AIM], Aspire, and Beacon. As we continue to focus on addressing the social drivers of health, Anthem is introducing new programs and partnerships to positively impact community health. Beginning this year, Beacon is launching an innovative program designed to address the basic needs of an employer's workforce through onsite resource coordinators focused on things like housing, food, transportation, and other core resources. Through this program, Beacon will help employers identify and remove obstacles to creating a safer and more productive work environment for their employees. The need for this type of solution will only increase as employer\u2019s transition their workforce back into the workplace. And we look forward to scaling this offering across our markets in the future, after going live with a major national retailer in the second quarter. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we stand ready to adapt and carry forward our momentum. Anthem\u2019s Benefit business is among the most balanced and resilient in the sector. And we have ample opportunity to unlock our full potential by scaling best in class healthcare services businesses to serve Anthem\u2019s members, as well as other health care plans externally. Should the pandemic come to an end sooner, and the economy recover faster, our commercial business will be well-positioned to accelerate its growth. Should the pandemic persist, our Medicaid business will likely continue to grow at an accelerated pace. Regardless of the outcome, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our consumers, care partners, and shareholders. I'll now turn the floor over to John to discuss our financial performance in more detail. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01 growth of over 8% year-over-year. Our first quarter results reflect the execution of our enterprise strategy, while continuing to navigate through the pandemic.  We ended the quarter with medical membership totaling 43.5 million members, an increase of 1.4 million lives, or 3.3% year-over-year, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our risk-based membership grew by 1.8 million members over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by organic growth in Medicaid, aided by the suspension of re-verifications. In addition, our Medicare Advantage membership grew by 197,000 lives or 15% year-over-year, in-line with our expectations, and on track to achieve low double digit growth for the full year. This growth was partially offset by negative in-group change within our commercial fee-based business, which was to be expected given the economic challenges presented by the pandemic. From a membership reporting perspective, please note that we have changed our presentation to delineate commercial risk-based and fee-based membership, and included a table looking back to the first quarter of 2020 in our press release for modeling purposes. Our overall growth in membership despite challenging economic backdrop reflects resilience and value of our core benefits businesses as our significant presence in both commercial and [Medicare] continue to complement one another well. First quarter operating revenue of $32.1 billion increased 9% over the prior year quarter or approximately 11% when excluding the impact of the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare and growth in our pharmacy product revenue. The medical loss ratio for the first quarter was 85.6%, an increase of 140 basis points over the first quarter of 2020 driven by cost associated with COVID-19, including testing and vaccine administration cost, and to a lesser extent, the permanent repeal of the HIF. Adjusted for the HIF, our first quarter MOR would have decreased by 10 basis points. Relative to our expectations, the cost of COVID-related care developed favorably driven by an earlier and sharper decline in COVID hospitalizations than we had anticipated. This was partially offset by a faster recovery and non-COVID cost, in-part due to the accelerated roll-out of the vaccine, as well as the impact of an extra calendar day in the first quarter of 2020. Medical claims payable for 2020 dates of service, or prior year reserve development also developed better than our expectations, but were entirely offset by reserve reestablishment. Or first quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 12.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2020.  Excluding the effects of the HIF, our SG&A ratio would have increased by 60 basis points, driven by increased spending to support growth, including our ongoing efforts to become a digital first enterprise, partially offset by the leverage against the growth in our operating revenue. The investments we're making today will be key to achieving greater operating efficiency over the long-term, and will enable us to achieve our 11% to 12% SG&A ratio target by 2025. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 41.6%, up from 38.7% at year-end 2020. The increase was due to debt raised in the quarter to fund our pending acquisitions and refinance and upcoming maturity. We continue to expect a debt to cap ratio to be slightly below 40% by the end of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $316.06 for approximately $447 million, representing slightly more than 25% of our full-year guidance. At this point, we continue to believe that our initial guidance of $1.6 billion in share repurchase remains appropriate for the full-year. We maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves in-light of the pandemic and its associated uncertainties. And as a result, days and claims payable increased by 3.5 days sequentially, ending the first quarter at 46.9 days, which is up 5 days year-over-year. Medical claims payable increased nearly 25% year-over-year, compared with premium growth of approximately 9%. Finally, our operating cash flow during the first quarter was $2.5 billion or 1.5 times net income better than expected and yet another indication of our strong quality of earnings. Note that operating cash flow as a percentage of net income will drop later in the year as we make payments on the multi-district litigation settlement and satisfy certain [MLR or collar payments]. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. And as a result, we have raised our full-year outlook for adjusted earnings per share by $0.60 from greater than $24.50 to greater than $25.10. The raise in our guidance reflects both the upside from strong core performance in the first quarter, and the approximate $0.30 benefit associated with the extension of the sequestration holiday through the end of the year, partially offset by higher vaccine administration cost and the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic. Our full-year outlook continues to embed net cost associated with COVID in the order of $600 million. Despite this headwind, we are pleased to be on track to deliver growth and adjusted earnings per share inside our long-term annual target range of 12% to 15%. While our core businesses perform well during the quarter, we remain cognizant of the risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic. Notably, the potential for a prolonged fourth wave, new COVID variants, pent-up demand for healthcare services, and the potential for higher acuity episodes of care associated with a deferral of procedures throughout the pandemic. Our updated guidance contemplates all these factors and we are pleased to pass through much of the upside in the first quarter, despite a cautious, but prudent approach to forecasting the balance of this year. With much of our guidance raise reflecting the first quarter outperformance, we now expect between 52% and 54% of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to occur in the first half of the year. Given a faster roll-out of the vaccine, we expect non-COVID utilization to rebound sooner, and we now expect to absorb higher COVID vaccination administration cost during the second quarter. As a result, we are currently modeling our second quarter [MLR] to be near the midpoint of our full-year outlook of 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points.  And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Mr. Wolfe, please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. So, a couple of quick numbers questions here. First, PYD and reserves in the quarter, you had [growth PYD] of 1.5 billion significantly above typical, but reserves actually grew despite that. So, I was hoping you could give us some color on, you know how that impacted the quarter? And then, you know, the Biden administration has been making a significant changes to the exchanges in Medicaid that would seem to drive membership growth, I was hoping you might be able to give us some color on how you think the benefit might be here and the potential offset against the future restart of re-determinations in Medicaid by the states at some point? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the questions, Justin, and good morning. This is John. So, I'll start out with the reserve question in the prior period development, you know, the $1.5 billion number looks like a big number, but you know, please note that the presentation is on a gross basis. And that number in a vacuum can be somewhat misleading. You know, a large percentage of that release will never hit the income statement.  I'm sure you know that as reserves are released, you know, some of the items impact MLR rebates and collars, risk corridor calculations, and we're funding mechanisms with some of our contractual provisions. But most importantly, we believe that we have reestablished the reserves to be uncertainty associated with COVID. And, you know, consistent with that maybe a question, you know, I will affirm that we believe that there is no net benefit to the first quarter associated with the PYD that was going through the statements this quarter, [with that].\nGail Boudreaux: Hi Justin, this is Gail, thanks for that question. In terms of the exchanges, we are pleased about the extended open enrollment and feel that while we're in the midst of it now, we feel that there will be some solid membership growth in the individual exchanges. In addition, though, to your second part of the question, how does that affect re-verification? I think at this stage, it's very hard for us to see our assumption is that re-verification remains on hold through all of 2021. You know, we do have a balanced portfolio. We've shared that a number of times and the mix serves as a natural hedge for us. But as we look at, you know, the growth inside of our Medicaid business, we've not really seen a significant amount of individuals coming from the commercial market into Medicaid at this stage. Some of that just may still be the timing and people are still on their employer plans, etcetera. But at this stage, we haven't seen a significant growth in Medicaid. It's been predominantly through e-verifications. The other thing I just want to note is that we don't really see a cliff event in 2022 as we work with our states, even as re-verification will go away in 2022. We see that as much more of a gradual approach as our states think about continuing to keep people on the Medicaid rolls. So thanks very much for the question, and we'll go to the next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Mr. Borsch, please go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: Yes, can you hear me?\nOperator: Yes, I can.\nMatt Borsch: Okay, sorry. I just wanted to ask a question on your utilization management program. Specifically, what I'm referring to, we're hearing what seems to be some apparently sort of intense pushback from the hospital providers regarding what they're describing is your push to drive outpatient services off the hospital campus to less expensive freestanding locations? I'm not really familiar with what you're doing here. But I know, I think I understand you're not alone, other plans are taking similar actions. I'm just curious about how you're handling the blowback from hospitals? It's all financial and what they claim is related to quality of care.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Matt. I think that there's a lot in there and not just specifically to, you know, your question on hospitals. You know, first and foremost, our focus is on really implementing value-based care and ensuring that our care providers really are in the driver\u2019s seat of right place, appropriate place of service etcetera. As I think about your specific question, however, we are looking to work with our hospital providers, as well as our outpatient facilities to ensure that patients are in the right place of care with what's happened in the pandemic. Clearly, our patients were more concerned about being in the hospital settings. That allowed us to enable that we supported outpatient care and outpatient settings more specifically. And so, so we have implemented those policies, we had them in place before. So, this isn't new, but I think it's accelerated with the pandemic, as patients have become much more comfortable in those settings, as well as the access has been greater for individuals. So, in terms of the overall model, our focus again is on affordability, trying to drive affordability, make sure that it's appropriate care at the right place and right setting that's been specific. And it ties very much to our value-based model, where we work closely with our local physicians. So, it's not just Anthem doing this through [UM programs], it's really part of embedded in our value-based value based programs with physicians. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Mr. Rice, please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. I might just ask, sounds like working with the other Blues, this launch of the high performance network you're talking about? And the savings you're generating, I guess I'm interested in how much of a change you have to get in the way people there \u2013 the patterns that people are using for care with doctors, hospitals, close to give providers to realize those savings? Are you changing significant amounts of their typical patterns of utilization to get that or is that sort of around the edges? And to the extent that you're doing this with the other Blues, I guess I brought it out and also asked you about any updates on you thought about Blues collaboration, some of the initiatives around there?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, A.J. It's a great question. As I shared in my opening remarks, we launched the high performance network in conjunction with other Blues. And just to give a little bit of background on how it works, it really launched just beginning in January of 2021. So, it's a fairly new offering across the system. And it's available right now in 55 MSAs. So, most of those, but half of those, roughly half are in Anthem service areas right now, but we comprise about 56% of the U.S. population, and it's something we're going to continue to grow every year. So, I think that's important. The cost savings are significant. I gave you a range of savings anywhere from around 11% to up to 20%. Our goal in this, like a strategy, network strategy is focused on leveraging already deep provider relationships and to scale and simplify it and also focus on the high performing providers that we know based on our deep data across the country. So what we're seeing, you know, in our first offering, you know, we had a number of customers select us over 350,000, I think total members had access to it and our first entry, again, is about 10% to 15% of those who have access to it are picking the high performance network, we expect that to grow. Again, this is a new offering in January. But it's flexible enough to allow our local markets in partnership with other Blues to continue to build and develop that. So again, this is based off of our deep knowledge and deep information that we have around networks and our partnership with other Blues. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Mr. Wilkes, please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yeah, good morning. Could you just give an update on capital deployment priorities and what I was specifically interested in is, if you could talk a little bit about your focus and what you're doing with respect to, kind of value-based care delivery initiatives, including stakes in companies and things like that, and maybe contrasting that with your discussion on digital first, and especially businesses to cross-sell, and complimentary care delivery capabilities. In particular, I'm focused on where you're acquiring or partnering with companies as opposed to your organic build.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Lance. I appreciate the question. So, first of all, I think our approach to the capital deployment is remaining consistent. We're looking to take approximately 50% of our free cash flow and utilize it for reinvestment in the business, as well as M&A and their deployment activities close to 30% for share buyback and 20% as dividends directly return back to the shareholders. And we obviously want to be very opportunistic and advantages associated with that, but, you know with that, I think Gail wanted to make a couple comments on your specific question.\nGail Boudreaux : Yeah, thanks, Lance. There was a lot in there. So, I'll try to try to capture each of them. I want to start with your, sort of underlying question, which is investments in the care delivery system. You know, as you know, our strategy first and foremost is to partner with primary care physicians in our local markets. And I've shared that on a number of times in this call. Part of that, again, is one in eight patients already carrying [Anthem idea], we feel that that model really enables us to work closely with them, and that we can drive differentiated managed care performance by using the data and we've been investing in AI and virtual care to ensure that we can help them make better decisions. With that said, though, I think what's under I think, valued and under understood, not understood well, in terms of our investments that we are participating in the value created through our value-based relationships. So, where we can keep our members healthier and I think specific examples of where we participate in that value creation and invest is, you know our examples of CareMore in HealthSun, and recently our announced acquisition of MMM.  And another area where we've deployed capital, which I shared areas that enable and create new payment models, and those are the ones that can address the more complex conditions. And again, examples there would be MyNEXUS, Aspire and Beacon, where we\u2019re leveraging that first and foremost across our Anthem membership to create value both for DBG, as well as Anthem in driving down overall costs of care, but also to sell externally. So, it's a bit of a double strategy there and I think, help support, you know, how we're using our capital to drive better returns, both for our customers, as well as Anthem internally. And then, you know, we shared at Investor Day a number of investments that we're making in digital to create the healthcare platform. Some of those are around consumer tools. Sydney, we've continued to advance where we are with Sydney Care. We're also investing in our health OS model. All of that\u2019s wrapped around artificial intelligence to really drive much better decision making. And the last area that I just want to share is, we recently announced collaboration that's part of our broader innovation. A collaboration that allows us to partner with stakeholders across the health system called [hydrogen]. Our goal there is to really support virtual care driving down costs and trend towards CPI, which we've shared, giving consumers access to basic health care needs. And this is again, another virtual care opportunity, whether it's via video, phone, text, or chat, looking for efficiency and quality. The partnerships with K Health enables us to provide access to virtual care. So that's an example of innovation, where we're investing as part of the overall healthcare ecosystem. So again, a lot of examples there, trying to give you a sense of both from how we're investing in the healthcare delivery system, and participating in the value that we create there, as well as in our virtual tools. So thanks very much for that question. Hopefully, we got to all the components of it. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Mr. Windley, please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill into, kind of claims and your visibility into pent up demand and utilization, it seems that patient hesitancy has perhaps been a little bit higher in the senior populations. I think that's logical, but it also seems to be borne out in the data. And so I'm wondering if you could speak to the relative levels of deferred care between the books of business, and how much visibility do you feel like you have into what is scheduled? How much might come back, how much might not come back, and whether the reserves that you are keeping on the balance sheet at this point are a conservative position against the unknown, or more of a known position against what you're kind of able to assess in the system capacity? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, David, for that one lengthy question. See, if I can respond to all of the items that you've focused on. You know, in terms of the claims versus the visibility, we obviously track that very, very closely. You know, we're evaluating pre-served, pre-authorization information on a daily basis, certainly understand that. We're looking at the types of care that are deferred versus those that are not deferred, and trying to assess that associated with, you know, the core underlying businesses. You know, it's still a little bit too early to have a noticeable shift in non-COVID utilization. But as I said, we continue to closely monitor our markets as vaccination rates increase. And, you know, in terms of geographic, there's probably not a big disparity at this point associated with lines of business. You know, the senior population has been vaccinated sooner. And so we are seeing a significant decline in COVID in-patient associated with seniors, which means that the non-COVID can rebound a bit faster. We believe that we've totally factored that in. You know, people were still able to largely get care in 2020, after the stay at home mandates for ease. So, you know, the giant backlog we don't think is quite there, the same way, and there are natural systems capacities as well. And maybe just to focus on your reserves that question at the end, we believe our reserves are very prudently stated, and that they are associated with a lot of the unknowns and uncertainties associated with COVID as opposed to the other part of your question. So, thank you for that and hopefully that addresses all of your questions.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steve Valiquette from Barclays. Mr. Valiquette, please go ahead.\nSteve Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Yeah, John, on the last quarterly conference call, you made some positive comments that with the $0.50 to $0.70 COVID headwinds built in the initial 2021 guidance of $24.50, [but] you still viewed $25.10 as a proper jump off point in 2021 when thinking about EPS growth in 2022 that could still track within the long-term range. I guess, just given the updated guidance for 2021 today with the increase as the moving parts, as you alluded to, I just want to confirm what you believe is the updated jump-off points this year when thinking about potential normalized 12% to 15% EPS growth for 2022? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thanks for the question, Steve. You know, as we discussed last quarter, you know, $25.10 was the level of earnings that we felt best represented or normalized earnings power for 2021. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the 12% to 15% growth target off of that level beginning in 2022. You know, it's really too premature to get any more specific associated with 2022 at this point in time, but we do feel very good about the $25.10 representing our core earnings or normalized earnings power is a jumping off point. So, thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Mr. Fidel, please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks and good morning. Had a question just on the Medicaid business and interested if you could just give us an update on what the impact was from Medicaid, from the risk corridors and experience rated rebates in the first quarter, and how that trended relative to your expectations? And then just how you're thinking about the tempo of government margin over the course of the year? First quarter was a bit below the long-term target, but obviously had the impact from the Medicaid rebates, I'm assuming. So, just thinking about how that \u2013 you think that's going to trend over the course of the year? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Sure. No, thank you for the question. You know, Medicaid, certainly Medicaid is performing well. You know, we do believe that we have received appropriate [naturally sound] rates from our state partners. And we very much expect to end 2021 within our target margin ranges. Feel very, very good about Medicaid. On Medicare, maybe just to be very forthright about the Medicare business, finished the first quarter slightly below our target margin ranges, but largely for all the reasons that we've already identified. The elevated COVID cost, mostly in January impacted the senior population.  The reduction of the risk revenue did a suppressed 2020 utilization, which we've talked about in the last call is certainly impacting. And as you know, we have the continued payment of the 20%, DRG bump, and the 3.75% Medicare fee schedule increases impacting that line of business. But you know, those COVID factors are all transient. And, you know, we have great membership growth trajectory in Medicare, really improving that block of business, and we think that the future earnings potential for Medicare is significant and feel very, very good about the long-term aspects associated with Medicare.\nGail Boudreaux: Can ask Felicia maybe to comment a little bit just about the Medicaid business?\nFelicia Norwood: Thank you. You know, our Medicaid business is continuing to perform well. We are very respectful that our states are going through a very challenging time in light of the pandemic, but we've been working very closely with them to make sure that the rates that we're receiving are actuarially sound and taking a view with respect to the long-term. If you know, we are at a point now, where roughly 50% of our states have already renewed and our states that renew in the second half of the year with respect to rates, we're engaged in conversations with them right now. You know, as you know, this is really an iterative process. We work very closely with our state partners to make sure that we achieve actuarially sound rates, but have been very mindful of the consequences of the pandemic and the recovery that needs to follow. So, as we think about 2022, we are very optimistic about being able to deliver performance within our target margin range of 2% to 4%. And we'll continue to work closely with our state partners during this time. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Felicia. And as you heard, I think we feel very constructive about those businesses. And as John shared with you a lot of the things that are really transient related to COVID-19, but overall feel very good about our core businesses. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Mr. Giacobbe, please go ahead.\nRalph Giacobbe: Thanks, morning. Gail, you mentioned the delayed decisions until 2022. First, just wanted to clarify that the 2021 selling season for 2022 or were you saying 2022 for 2023? And then just maybe if you can give us a sense of how much of your book is going out this year versus a typical year, and just any insights on how much is up for grabs more broadly, and maybe your opportunity to gain share within commercial? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Thanks for the question, Ralph. Let me just clarify or answer your specifics. And I'll ask Pete to talk about the commercial market. Now in my prepared comments, I was really referring to this year selling season for national accounts where a lot of individuals differed from 2021 to 2022. However, we still, as I mentioned, had one of our most successful selling seasons ever, and I really credit Pete and his team for, you know, the focus of the products and innovation that they brought to the market, but it was in terms of pipeline, individuals winning, but Pete, why don't you comment a little bit more about the commercial market?\nPete Haytaian: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Gail. And thanks for the question, Ralph. We were really pleased with how enrollment landed in the first quarter. We saw nice sequential growth of 159,000 in the quarter, excuse me, the same dynamics that I really mentioned in the past are continuing. First of all, from an execution perspective, as Gail noted, our sales continue to exceed our losses. And what was really nice to see, you know, this year in the quarter, again, is our fully insured growth. Our local group business grew nicely, sequentially. If you were to, sort of say, you know, what was a bit of a headwind, our growth could have been more if not for the economic impacts, again, associated with COVID, and the in-group change dynamics that really continue, and most specifically affect our fee-based business. But like Gail said, I feel very good about our positioning going forward, our execution is strong, our portfolio products, our choice is strong. And as we see the economy improve, we're very confident that we're going to continue to see our growth accelerate.\nGail Boudreaux: And Ralph just a quick comment on your other question about what is the season. It's really early in the national accounts selling season? So, we're, it's really developing at this stage. We are seeing some expanded opportunities. And certainly we'll update you as we get to the second quarter call where I have a little bit better insight. But overall, we feel really well-positioned. I think our offerings have been resonating quite well. Biggest issue for Pete right now is just the in-group attrition that came through in the first quarter. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Mr. Hill, please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. One of the things that you guys highlighted in the press release was the change in timing as related to PBM business, and the impact of selling integrated pharmacy and medical on the positivity of results. I guess, could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the selling of the integrated medical and pharmacy business and the impact of the out of period adjustment? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: I\u2019m going to ask Pete to address that. Thank you.\nPete Haytaian: Yeah, thanks for your question. You know, we mentioned this, but, you know, last year because of COVID, we did see a bit of hesitancy in terms of transitioning, pharmacy and transition of PBMs, especially on the upper end of the market, as you'd expect. That said, we are beginning to see and I'm very, very pleased with the progress we're beginning to see more activity. And to your point, the team is working very closely on the integrated value proposition. I think down market, we are definitely beginning to see good signs. Our win rate is improving on down market and the [RFP activity] is picking up. And at the upper end of the market, there's still a bit of hesitancy, but as I said, we are seeing RFP activity pickup for 2022. We are in the middle of that selling season right now. We are in a lot of finalist presentations, and we're across several different opportunities. I would say, it's, just like Gail said, as it relates to the national selling season, it's early as it relates to 2022 still, and I'd say over the next several weeks and months, we'll have better visibility on our wins on the upper end of the market headed into 2022.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Jones, please go ahead.\nRobert Jones: Thanks for the question. I guess maybe just to stick with Ingenio, you know, operating gains in the quarter were relatively strong. No, I was hoping maybe you could give a little bit more around the drivers there. And I do think in the press release, you did call out an out of period adjustment. Just wanted to make sure we understood that as we think about modeling Ingenio for the balance of the year. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks very much for the question. You know, overall, Ingenio has been performing extremely well, based on our expectations, and again, it's the group growth within Ingenio and sort of the strong work on that we've had. In terms of the one-time adjustment that was called out, it really is a true up in our specialty pricing. So, on a run rate basis, we still feel very good and bullish about it being in a 6% to 6.5% margin target. That's sustainable. So, as you think about that, overall, those are really the key drivers. I think Ingenio has really hit its stride in terms of our business. One of the things I think that's important to keep in mind that our first quarter 2020 results were somewhat elevated, artificially elevated, [that is] because we relaxed the refill to soon provision as part of the pandemic, and the pandemic was intensifying here as everyone knows. So we \u2013 that resulted in a pull forward of earnings from the second quarter into the first of 2020. So, hopefully that gives you the insight that you're looking for. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron. Mr. Raskin, please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Are you seeing any evidence of an increase in utilization either pent-up demand or higher acuity resulting from, you know deferred care from last year?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Josh. I think it's still just a bit early to see any noticeable shift in non-COVID utilization and pent-up demand. We are seeing some of our states like Maine and Connecticut have some of the highest vaccination rates were Arkansas and Texas appear to be a bit lower. And there's really not a big material difference in utilization levels between those markets. And I think part of it has to do with the comment that I made earlier in the Q&A session, that, you know, folks were able to get access to care in 2020, you know when a lot of the stay at home rules were relaxed. So, at this point in time, you know, we are taking a very cautious approach, certainly monitoring all the variables. But you know, we still believe that our original outlook for utilization is appropriate and prudent.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Mr. Goldwasser, please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yeah. Hi, good morning. So, my question is on SG&A. I mean, clearly SG&A in the quarter was high, reflecting the investment in the enterprise. When we think about these investments, I mean Gail, you talked about everything that you're doing in digital, should we think about these as sort of front end loaded versus kind of like rest of the year? And then as we think about a specific investment, from your perspective, sort of what makes you most excited about and how is the relationship with Blackstone and K Health on the digital side relates to the internal investments, would love to hear a little bit more about that?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Ricky. I'll start out by answering the beginning your question and turn it over to Pete to talk a little bit more about K Health and that aspect of your question, but you know, as you know that we continue to invest in new digital mobile capabilities to drive greater automation and enhance our customer experience, really, a lot of the consumer facing tools. You know, we're focused on improving the way we do business with our distribution partners. We have a new broker portal that offers distribution partners, a simplified digital platform to enable them to sell seamlessly. And we're standardizing our clinical and well-being solutions and the preset packages. Make it easier for our employers to understand and purchase the suite of products most relevant to your needs. So, I give those examples just to show you that your digital capabilities and digital investments are impacting every aspect of the company and every aspect of the business. You know, and that's with \u2013 also doing our system consolidation work that we've been focused on here for the last several years. In terms of the spending, you know, obviously, we did accelerate some spending here in the first quarter, but we will be spending on this throughout the year. The SG&A ratio will go down a little bit in the latter half of the year as our revenue accelerates, you know specifically when we go live with North Carolina Medicaid with some of the continued growth that we expect in core Medicaid with the special enrollment for ACA. All businesses have a drive to top line accordingly, but there's still a lot of spending left to be done in order to achieve our goals and expectations. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to talk a little bit more about K Health.\nPete Haytaian: Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot, John. And, you know, I'll just jump off of what Gail was saying earlier about the acceleration of digital on our product offerings and the importance of partnerships. And our partnership with K and Blackstone is really another example of one of these strong partnerships where we're developing an approach to accelerate the use of digital AI to really help drive more efficient and effective care with a differentiated consumer experience. Specifically, as it relates to this partnership, it builds upon all this. It's helping us offer direct to consumer, direct to employer and direct to ensure or product options that really enabled Anthem as the front door to healthcare. It's really creating this digital first experience where access to basic care needs can occur via, as Gail said earlier, text, chat, and videos with a physician. And if more acute care needs or in-person care is needed, it really helps facilitate or triage care to the right care at the right place at the right time. And so, yes, this is just another great example of a partnership that helps bring greater efficiency and a better consumer experience to our members.\nGail Boudreaux: Ricky, you asked an important question about which investments and pieces of digitally you should be really excited about? And I guess I wanted to address that directly. Because I think that this is really, our investments are long-term investments to drive growth in a business model transformation. And quite frankly, I think we're excited about all of them, but fundamentally what we shared at Investor Day, the digital platform for health, which is going to transform how we work and what we do both at the consumer level, as well as at the level of our care providers with our Health OS operating platform. Plus, we're also investing heavily in virtual care. So again, that goes back to my earlier comments around us participating in the value creation of that, all surrounded by the use of the data that we've had locked for a long time. So, ability to be predictive with AI. So, I'm excited about the business transformation that digital drives across all of our businesses, and I think that's really the core. To put out a sort of final point on how we think about the investments, as John said, you know, our goal is, again, this is to drive growth in our business, and we are committed to \u2013 this is our way to get to the long-term 11% to 12% administrative expense ratio that again we shared at Investor Day. So, thanks again, for the question. There's a lot of initiatives embedded inside of that, but I think fundamentally, it's about a business model transformation and a digital platform for health. Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Mr. Fischbeck, please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. So trying to understand the moving pieces and the guidance, because you guys beat and then you raised by the beat, but then it seemed like half of the race was due to sequestration. You didn't change your view on the COVID headwind, so that doesn't seem to be an offset to the numbers. And then you said that the core business was performing better than expected. So, just trying to reconcile all of that, I guess maybe you just elaborate a little bit more when you say the core business came in better than expected, driving a raise, what exactly, you know is coming in better than expected. And if it's coming in better than expected, why isn't that leading to a larger raise, you know, through the rest of the year?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the question, Kevin. And, as you pointed out, there are many moving parts associated with the guidance for the year. First quarter results of $7.01 were about $0.60 ahead of consensus estimates. And as you pointed out, the sequestration extension adds another $0.30 of upside. And then with all that, we also have the fourth wave of COVID as I've been more prolonged and anticipated. And also, just a month or so ago, we found out that we're required to increase the vaccine administration rates from $28 of those to $48 of those. You know, all-in with the, you know, with that core performance, we obviously feel very comfortable delivering the upside back to the shareholders and raising guidance, up to $25.10. In terms of core performance, you know, core performance is a lot of things. You know, it's the growth, you know, we've seen great core performance and better than expected in commercial, in Medicaid, in Ingenio, in Diversified Business Group, they\u2019re all doing very, very well. And, you know, we've seen growth in all those areas. You know, the medical cost, as we look at the costs that have been incurred, plus the expectation of pent-up demand, we feel good about that. And the SG&A efficiencies on a run rate basis after we pull out some of the investment spending. You know, so we're really very bullish about how well positioned we are and what the future holds. So, we've raised guidance accordingly. But thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question, we'll go to the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen. Mr. Rhyee, please go ahead.\nCharles Rhyee: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. You know, maybe Gail, I wanted to go back, you were talking earlier about, you know, the work you're doing, particularly for social drivers of health and a lot of new programs, a partnership that you were talking about, and particularly with Beacon. And you kind of made a comment about Beacon like it's trying \u2013 is that talking about transitioning from an onsite kind of service to be delivered through a retail, kind of model, because you talked about going live with a major national retailer, maybe can you talk a little bit more about how that actually works? What the economics are for Anthem and who\u2019s paying for the service, is it still employers? Any kind of commentary there would be helpful?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Charles. Let me clarify a little bit about what the innovative model that we're building. One of the things that we've learned, both of our own employees, quite frankly, and the work that we've done in the community is that the social drivers obviously have a huge impact on people's health. And that has always been embedded in the core of Anthem\u2019s strategy. The specific program that Beacon is working on is with a large national employer, basically, who is a retailer to help support all of those efforts within their own employee population. That's, I think an innovative product offering, I would think of it that way, as a way to connect all of these issues that affect employees.  We've had them, at Anthem, we actually built into our own employee benefit program this year; with something we call a health essentials program to help support people. And what we learned during the pandemic is that the needs, particularly the behavioral health needs, the needs to social services, access with caregivers, all of those things really weigh heavily on employers and impact their productivity. And their ability to quite frankly, come to work and be their full self, especially in an environment like this. So, we saw that need, built this innovative product.  It does include on-site resource coordinators to help with housing, food, and transportation. This is a product we think, again, very innovative, no one else has it in the market that we believe will resonate very much with our, particularly our large national accounts. It's something we've done in our government programs. I think what's not well understood for a lot of individuals is that the issues that affect that we put in \u2013 the programs that we put into place in our government programs affect individuals, consumers in our commercial markets, as well.  And so we're taking what we've learned from those markets and hope to scale it across all of our markets. So, again, a great question. We think it's a really innovative approach. And we think it's a great opportunity to offer a different solution for employers as they bring their employees back into the physical workplace. So, thanks very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: For the last question, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Mr. Cottrell, please go ahead.\nRob Cottrell: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the color on MyNEXUS, it sounds like that's primarily focused on the Medicare population today. Curious if there's opportunity to expand that. So, Medicaid and commercial members, and then also any Blue partnership opportunities that may come from, you know, the increased exposure to home based care?\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question. I'll start and then I\u2019ll ask Felicia to provide a little bit of color because she has worked closely with MyNEXUS, as you know, MyNEXUS will be part of our diversified business group. You know, I think MyNEXUS is really a great example of a fit within Anthem and our strategy that we shared with you at Investor Day, around managing integrated and multi-care services. And again, our strategy has always been around whole person care, providing that expertise. And this one, MyNEXUS in particular, offers an extensive network of home providers, including 9 of the 10, top national providers in high quality. So again, those are really important components of it. As we look at the, you know, in-home visitation authorization and time to care, all those things, what was great about MyNEXUS is that we had worked with them extensively, and we saw the value. So, this is a great example of driving value inside of our own population. Today, it is predominantly Medicare Advantage members. But we do see opportunities to obviously offer this to other health plans, because we think it's a highly valued service. And I\u2019ll ask Felicia maybe to comment on the opportunities that are across our broader book of business, because again, we do think that the model works quite well. And we've seen nice returns. So Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood : Yes, thank you for that question, Rob. And I will say Gail hit it well. We found this to be a very valuable asset for us from a Medicare Advantage perspective. But we certainly see the opportunity to take a look at the ability to scale this across other parts of government business as well. As you know, our duals are a key platform for us when we take a look at the opportunity for growth in our government business. [Indiscernible] populations will be continued areas focus for us as we go forward. So this is an example of an opportunity for us to leverage this internally, but also across the blue partnerships that we have in government business and Medicare, as well as Medicaid. So thank you very much for that question.\nGail Boudreaux: And thanks, Felicia. One other thing that I would notice that MyNEXUS, you shouldn't think of it as just a standalone because we actually see the opportunity for really integrated solutions, combining home health post acute, palliative, and behavioral. So, if you think about what we do, and some of our other businesses like Aspire, again, our ability to be deeper in the home, this provides, again, an integrative opportunity. Thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: And that was our final question.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you very much. I guess we are done with our questions. So, appreciate all of the questions that we had today. And I want to thank all of you for joining us for the call this morning. As you heard and can see, Anthem has shown solid growth throughout this pandemic while continuing to provide critical support in resources to our communities as we combat this pandemic together. Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth prospects and deliver on our commitment to all of our stakeholders. Our success would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 85,000 associates who exemplify our mission, vision, and values. And I want to thank each and every one of them for all that they do each and every day. Thank you for your interest in Anthem, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 A.M. today through May 20, 2021.

            "name": "Pete Haytaian",
            "content": "Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Gail. And thanks for the question, Ralph. We were really pleased with how enrollment landed in the first quarter. We saw nice sequential growth of 159,000 in the quarter, excuse me, the same dynamics that I really mentioned in the past are continuing. First of all, from an execution perspective, as Gail noted, our sales continue to exceed our losses. And what was really nice to see, you know, this year in the quarter, again, is our fully insured growth. Our local group business grew nicely, sequentially. If you were to, sort of say, you know, what was a bit of a headwind, our growth could have been more if not for the economic impacts, again, associated with COVID, and the in-group change dynamics that really continue, and most specifically affect our fee-based business. But like Gail said, I feel very good about our positioning going forward, our execution is strong, our portfolio products, our choice is strong. And as we see the economy improve, we're very confident that we're going to continue to see our growth accelerate. Yeah, thanks for your question. You know, we mentioned this, but, you know, last year because of COVID, we did see a bit of hesitancy in terms of transitioning, pharmacy and transition of PBMs, especially on the upper end of the market, as you'd expect. That said, we are beginning to see and I'm very, very pleased with the progress we're beginning to see more activity. And to your point, the team is working very closely on the integrated value proposition. I think down market, we are definitely beginning to see good signs. Our win rate is improving on down market and the [RFP activity] is picking up. And at the upper end of the market, there's still a bit of hesitancy, but as I said, we are seeing RFP activity pickup for 2022. We are in the middle of that selling season right now. We are in a lot of finalist presentations, and we're across several different opportunities. I would say, it's, just like Gail said, as it relates to the national selling season, it's early as it relates to 2022 still, and I'd say over the next several weeks and months, we'll have better visibility on our wins on the upper end of the market headed into 2022. Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot, John. And, you know, I'll just jump off of what Gail was saying earlier about the acceleration of digital on our product offerings and the importance of partnerships. And our partnership with K and Blackstone is really another example of one of these strong partnerships where we're developing an approach to accelerate the use of digital AI to really help drive more efficient and effective care with a differentiated consumer experience.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for Anthem's firsts quarter 2021 earnings call. This morning, we reported first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01, reflecting growing momentum in our business despite the challenges of the environment. When we came together for this call a year ago, we were only just beginning to understand the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications for health care. Over these last 12 months, I'm incredibly proud of how we've led during a period characterized by uncertainty. From day one, we partnered with local state and federal officials to ensure our members were prepared with the resources and support they need to navigate through the pandemic. In 2020, our associates logged more than 110,000 volunteer hours and more than 17,000 hours so far in 2021, addressing critical issues in their local communities, such as food insecurity, and social isolation. Our efforts have recently shifted from a focus on treatment and testing to vaccinations. We recognize that we play a critical role in the fight against the pandemic, and in ensuring safe and equitable access to vaccines in our communities. Through our multi-channel approach, we've been able to reach nearly two-thirds of our members with information regarding where, when, and how they can access COVID-19 vaccines in their own communities, including coordinating in-home vaccinations for our homebound members, while covering vaccine administration costs for our commercial members with no out of pocket cost sharing. In addition, clinicians at our CareMore and HealthSun clinics have helped thousands of our most vulnerable seniors get vaccinated. I'm incredibly grateful to our associates, who have adapted seamlessly and work diligently through the pandemic to support our consumers. Our focus on health starts with our own associates, and we're committed to empowering them to live a healthy lifestyle. For those who received the vaccine, we're offering a choice of a one-time credit towards their own health care premiums or a donation on their behalf to the Anthem Cares Fund, which provides financial support to Anthem Associates in need. As a company that has been grounded in our local communities for more than 75 years, we have an unwavering commitment to positively influence not only the health of our consumers, but the health of the communities in which we live and work. Membership growth in the first quarter clearly reflects the balance and resilience of our core business, with strong growth in our government business led by Medicaid. With eligibility re-verifications on hold across the country, our organic growth remains robust. Medicare Advantage membership also tracked in-line with our expectations growing [15%] year-over-year through the first quarter.  We're honored to have been selected to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in Ohio, a state where Anthem currently holds the leading commercial and Medicare Advantage market share positions. With the launch of this contract, Anthem will serve consumers across all products in the State of Ohio further underscoring our ability to be a lifetime trusted health partner.  Commercial enrollment grew sequentially to start the year outperforming expectations with growth led by our risk-based business. As expected, commercial membership decreased slightly year-over -year, driven by in-group attrition in our group fee based business. In spite of many national account prospects electing to delay decisions until 2022, we had one of our strongest selling seasons in the past five years. Sales exceeded lapses in our large group fully insured business for the sixth consecutive quarter and for 10 of the past 11. Our success speaks to the strength of our sales team, the value of our innovative solutions, and our commitment to being a valued partner to our customers. Given our solid overall performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to greater than $25.10 from greater than $24.50, putting us on track to achieve our long-term 12% to 15% annual adjusted EPS growth target, even as we continue to dedicate resources to combating the pandemic. Looking ahead, our digital solutions will continue to drive growth, and we are fundamentally changing how we leverage technology to deliver the exceptional experiences that consumers expect from us, and to help address health disparities and improve outcomes by sharing insight with care providers. We now have close to 10 million people engaged on our digital channels with access to a wide array of virtual care specialties and resources to help them lead healthy lives. One of our digital solutions, Anthem's Concierge Care program aims to solve distinct problems for our customers. Our suite of programs universally offers seamless experience for members facing chronic or complex conditions, connecting them with their entire care team on a single centralized platform and allowing them to seek support in real time when it's right for them.  Today, our Concierge Care programs are available to just under 1 million members, with line of sight into tripling enrollment over the next few years. This program integrates remote patient monitoring that shares real time data with care providers at all times. We have also partnered with connected device manufacturers to leverage their capabilities to expand remote care options that allow patients and their clinicians to conduct virtual office visits, culminating and personalized experiences for members' better outcomes and improved affordability. Our deep roots in our communities and our partnership with local care providers enable us to scale these initiatives in real time with a focus on collaborating across the continuum of care, while ensuring our care provider partners have access to best-in-class digital tools and capabilities to help them deliver better outcomes. Predictive AI and real time access to data, coupled with a growing focus on value-based arrangements with care providers, is enabling us to improve access to high quality, affordable healthcare and facilitate better consumer and physician decision making. The integration of these capabilities is what will enable us to deliver on our commitment to drive commercial medical cost trend down towards CPI by 2025. A goal we shared with you at our Investor Day last month. Earlier this year, we launched the nation's largest high performance network in partnership with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. The Blue high performance network is guiding members towards providers who are aligned with our goal of driving greater affordability and improved outcomes. The benefits are compelling, with average savings of 11% and up to 20% in certain markets. Through AI and machine learning, we're also providing members with access to personalized health information to help them make informed healthcare decisions. When searching for providers, most digital tools automatically default to recommending providers based solely on location. Anthem's smart provider finder on our Sydney Health App gives consumers greater control of their care by taking into account the factors that matter most, such as conditions, specific needs, affordability, and quality. We're intensely focused on enhancing our capabilities aimed at addressing the needs of people with chronic and complex conditions. Our pending acquisition of MyNEXUS combines the power of digital and advanced analytics to expertly manage and coordinate home based health care. Anthem has been a customer of MyNEXUS since 2017 with more than 830,000 of our individual and group retiree Medicare Advantage members currently managed by MyNEXUS. We have seen first-hand the positive contributions MyNEXUS has had on our members' quality of life, and we look forward to expanding this impact across even more of our members. Equally important, this acquisition provides Anthem with another pathway to managing a greater portion of the overall healthcare dollar. A key strategic pillar of our diversified business group that will allow us to create end-to-end seamless experiences from post acute care to home health, with pathways to services like [AIM], Aspire, and Beacon. As we continue to focus on addressing the social drivers of health, Anthem is introducing new programs and partnerships to positively impact community health. Beginning this year, Beacon is launching an innovative program designed to address the basic needs of an employer's workforce through onsite resource coordinators focused on things like housing, food, transportation, and other core resources. Through this program, Beacon will help employers identify and remove obstacles to creating a safer and more productive work environment for their employees. The need for this type of solution will only increase as employer's transition their workforce back into the workplace. And we look forward to scaling this offering across our markets in the future, after going live with a major national retailer in the second quarter. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we stand ready to adapt and carry forward our momentum. Anthem's Benefit business is among the most balanced and resilient in the sector. And we have ample opportunity to unlock our full potential by scaling best in class healthcare services businesses to serve Anthem's members, as well as other health care plans externally. Should the pandemic come to an end sooner, and the economy recover faster, our commercial business will be well-positioned to accelerate its growth. Should the pandemic persist, our Medicaid business will likely continue to grow at an accelerated pace. Regardless of the outcome, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments to our consumers, care partners, and shareholders. I'll now turn the floor over to John to discuss our financial performance in more detail. John? Hi Justin, this is Gail, thanks for that question. In terms of the exchanges, we are pleased about the extended open enrollment and feel that while we're in the midst of it now, we feel that there will be some solid membership growth in the individual exchanges. In addition, though, to your second part of the question, how does that affect re-verification? I think at this stage, it's very hard for us to see our assumption is that re-verification remains on hold through all of 2021. You know, we do have a balanced portfolio. We've shared that a number of times and the mix serves as a natural hedge for us. But as we look at, you know, the growth inside of our Medicaid business, we've not really seen a significant amount of individuals coming from the commercial market into Medicaid at this stage. Some of that just may still be the timing and people are still on their employer plans, etcetera. But at this stage, we haven't seen a significant growth in Medicaid. It's been predominantly through e-verifications. The other thing I just want to note is that we don't really see a cliff event in 2022 as we work with our states, even as re-verification will go away in 2022. We see that as much more of a gradual approach as our states think about continuing to keep people on the Medicaid rolls. So thanks very much for the question, and we'll go to the next question. Thanks for the question, Matt. I think that there's a lot in there and not just specifically to, you know, your question on hospitals. You know, first and foremost, our focus is on really implementing value-based care and ensuring that our care providers really are in the driver's seat of right place, appropriate place of service etcetera. As I think about your specific question, however, we are looking to work with our hospital providers, as well as our outpatient facilities to ensure that patients are in the right place of care with what's happened in the pandemic. Clearly, our patients were more concerned about being in the hospital settings. That allowed us to enable that we supported outpatient care and outpatient settings more specifically. And so, so we have implemented those policies, we had them in place before. So, this isn't new, but I think it's accelerated with the pandemic, as patients have become much more comfortable in those settings, as well as the access has been greater for individuals. So, in terms of the overall model, our focus again is on affordability, trying to drive affordability, make sure that it's appropriate care at the right place and right setting that's been specific. And it ties very much to our value-based model, where we work closely with our local physicians. So, it's not just Anthem doing this through [UM programs], it's really part of embedded in our value-based value based programs with physicians. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question. Thanks for the question, A.J. It's a great question. As I shared in my opening remarks, we launched the high performance network in conjunction with other Blues. And just to give a little bit of background on how it works, it really launched just beginning in January of 2021. So, it's a fairly new offering across the system. And it's available right now in 55 MSAs. So, most of those, but half of those, roughly half are in Anthem service areas right now, but we comprise about 56% of the U.S. population, and it's something we're going to continue to grow every year. So, I think that's important. The cost savings are significant. I gave you a range of savings anywhere from around 11% to up to 20%. Our goal in this, like a strategy, network strategy is focused on leveraging already deep provider relationships and to scale and simplify it and also focus on the high performing providers that we know based on our deep data across the country. So what we're seeing, you know, in our first offering, you know, we had a number of customers select us over 350,000, I think total members had access to it and our first entry, again, is about 10% to 15% of those who have access to it are picking the high performance network, we expect that to grow. Again, this is a new offering in January. But it's flexible enough to allow our local markets in partnership with other Blues to continue to build and develop that. So again, this is based off of our deep knowledge and deep information that we have around networks and our partnership with other Blues. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. Yeah, thanks, Lance. There was a lot in there. So, I'll try to try to capture each of them. I want to start with your, sort of underlying question, which is investments in the care delivery system. You know, as you know, our strategy first and foremost is to partner with primary care physicians in our local markets. And I've shared that on a number of times in this call. Part of that, again, is one in eight patients already carrying [Anthem idea], we feel that that model really enables us to work closely with them, and that we can drive differentiated managed care performance by using the data and we've been investing in AI and virtual care to ensure that we can help them make better decisions. With that said, though, I think what's under I think, valued and under understood, not understood well, in terms of our investments that we are participating in the value created through our value-based relationships. So, where we can keep our members healthier and I think specific examples of where we participate in that value creation and invest is, you know our examples of CareMore in HealthSun, and recently our announced acquisition of MMM.  And another area where we've deployed capital, which I shared areas that enable and create new payment models, and those are the ones that can address the more complex conditions. And again, examples there would be MyNEXUS, Aspire and Beacon, where we're leveraging that first and foremost across our Anthem membership to create value both for DBG, as well as Anthem in driving down overall costs of care, but also to sell externally. So, it's a bit of a double strategy there and I think, help support, you know, how we're using our capital to drive better returns, both for our customers, as well as Anthem internally. And then, you know, we shared at Investor Day a number of investments that we're making in digital to create the healthcare platform. Some of those are around consumer tools. Sydney, we've continued to advance where we are with Sydney Care. We're also investing in our health OS model. All of that's wrapped around artificial intelligence to really drive much better decision making. And the last area that I just want to share is, we recently announced collaboration that's part of our broader innovation. A collaboration that allows us to partner with stakeholders across the health system called [hydrogen]. Our goal there is to really support virtual care driving down costs and trend towards CPI, which we've shared, giving consumers access to basic health care needs. And this is again, another virtual care opportunity, whether it's via video, phone, text, or chat, looking for efficiency and quality. The partnerships with K Health enables us to provide access to virtual care. So that's an example of innovation, where we're investing as part of the overall healthcare ecosystem. So again, a lot of examples there, trying to give you a sense of both from how we're investing in the healthcare delivery system, and participating in the value that we create there, as well as in our virtual tools. So thanks very much for that question. Hopefully, we got to all the components of it. Next question, please. Next question, please. Next question, please. Can ask Felicia maybe to comment a little bit just about the Medicaid business? Thanks, Felicia. And as you heard, I think we feel very constructive about those businesses. And as John shared with you a lot of the things that are really transient related to COVID-19, but overall feel very good about our core businesses. Next question, please. Sure. Thanks for the question, Ralph. Let me just clarify or answer your specifics. And I'll ask Pete to talk about the commercial market. Now in my prepared comments, I was really referring to this year selling season for national accounts where a lot of individuals differed from 2021 to 2022. However, we still, as I mentioned, had one of our most successful selling seasons ever, and I really credit Pete and his team for, you know, the focus of the products and innovation that they brought to the market, but it was in terms of pipeline, individuals winning, but Pete, why don't you comment a little bit more about the commercial market? And Ralph just a quick comment on your other question about what is the season. It's really early in the national accounts selling season? So, we're, it's really developing at this stage. We are seeing some expanded opportunities. And certainly we'll update you as we get to the second quarter call where I have a little bit better insight. But overall, we feel really well-positioned. I think our offerings have been resonating quite well. Biggest issue for Pete right now is just the in-group attrition that came through in the first quarter. Next question, please. I'm going to ask Pete to address that. Thank you. Thank you. Next question, please. Thanks very much for the question. You know, overall, Ingenio has been performing extremely well, based on our expectations, and again, it's the group growth within Ingenio and sort of the strong work on that we've had. In terms of the one-time adjustment that was called out, it really is a true up in our specialty pricing. So, on a run rate basis, we still feel very good and bullish about it being in a 6% to 6.5% margin target. That's sustainable. So, as you think about that, overall, those are really the key drivers. I think Ingenio has really hit its stride in terms of our business. One of the things I think that's important to keep in mind that our first quarter 2020 results were somewhat elevated, artificially elevated, [that is] because we relaxed the refill to soon provision as part of the pandemic, and the pandemic was intensifying here as everyone knows. So we \u2013 that resulted in a pull forward of earnings from the second quarter into the first of 2020. So, hopefully that gives you the insight that you're looking for. Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Ricky, you asked an important question about which investments and pieces of digitally you should be really excited about? And I guess I wanted to address that directly. Because I think that this is really, our investments are long-term investments to drive growth in a business model transformation. And quite frankly, I think we're excited about all of them, but fundamentally what we shared at Investor Day, the digital platform for health, which is going to transform how we work and what we do both at the consumer level, as well as at the level of our care providers with our Health OS operating platform. Plus, we're also investing heavily in virtual care. So again, that goes back to my earlier comments around us participating in the value creation of that, all surrounded by the use of the data that we've had locked for a long time. So, ability to be predictive with AI. So, I'm excited about the business transformation that digital drives across all of our businesses, and I think that's really the core. To put out a sort of final point on how we think about the investments, as John said, you know, our goal is, again, this is to drive growth in our business, and we are committed to \u2013 this is our way to get to the long-term 11% to 12% administrative expense ratio that again we shared at Investor Day. So, thanks again, for the question. There's a lot of initiatives embedded inside of that, but I think fundamentally, it's about a business model transformation and a digital platform for health. Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Next question, please. Yes. Thanks for the question, Charles. Let me clarify a little bit about what the innovative model that we're building. One of the things that we've learned, both of our own employees, quite frankly, and the work that we've done in the community is that the social drivers obviously have a huge impact on people's health. And that has always been embedded in the core of Anthem's strategy. The specific program that Beacon is working on is with a large national employer, basically, who is a retailer to help support all of those efforts within their own employee population. That's, I think an innovative product offering, I would think of it that way, as a way to connect all of these issues that affect employees.  We've had them, at Anthem, we actually built into our own employee benefit program this year; with something we call a health essentials program to help support people. And what we learned during the pandemic is that the needs, particularly the behavioral health needs, the needs to social services, access with caregivers, all of those things really weigh heavily on employers and impact their productivity. And their ability to quite frankly, come to work and be their full self, especially in an environment like this. So, we saw that need, built this innovative product.  It does include on-site resource coordinators to help with housing, food, and transportation. This is a product we think, again, very innovative, no one else has it in the market that we believe will resonate very much with our, particularly our large national accounts. It's something we've done in our government programs. I think what's not well understood for a lot of individuals is that the issues that affect that we put in \u2013 the programs that we put into place in our government programs affect individuals, consumers in our commercial markets, as well.  And so we're taking what we've learned from those markets and hope to scale it across all of our markets. So, again, a great question. We think it's a really innovative approach. And we think it's a great opportunity to offer a different solution for employers as they bring their employees back into the physical workplace. So, thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Well, thanks for the question. I'll start and then I'll ask Felicia to provide a little bit of color because she has worked closely with MyNEXUS, as you know, MyNEXUS will be part of our diversified business group. You know, I think MyNEXUS is really a great example of a fit within Anthem and our strategy that we shared with you at Investor Day, around managing integrated and multi-care services. And again, our strategy has always been around whole person care, providing that expertise. And this one, MyNEXUS in particular, offers an extensive network of home providers, including 9 of the 10, top national providers in high quality. So again, those are really important components of it. As we look at the, you know, in-home visitation authorization and time to care, all those things, what was great about MyNEXUS is that we had worked with them extensively, and we saw the value. So, this is a great example of driving value inside of our own population. Today, it is predominantly Medicare Advantage members. But we do see opportunities to obviously offer this to other health plans, because we think it's a highly valued service. And I'll ask Felicia maybe to comment on the opportunities that are across our broader book of business, because again, we do think that the model works quite well. And we've seen nice returns. So Felicia? And thanks, Felicia. One other thing that I would notice that MyNEXUS, you shouldn't think of it as just a standalone because we actually see the opportunity for really integrated solutions, combining home health post acute, palliative, and behavioral. So, if you think about what we do, and some of our other businesses like Aspire, again, our ability to be deeper in the home, this provides, again, an integrative opportunity. Thank you for the question. Next question, please. Thank you very much. I guess we are done with our questions. So, appreciate all of the questions that we had today. And I want to thank all of you for joining us for the call this morning. As you heard and can see, Anthem has shown solid growth throughout this pandemic while continuing to provide critical support in resources to our communities as we combat this pandemic together. Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on future growth prospects and deliver on our commitment to all of our stakeholders. Our success would not be possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 85,000 associates who exemplify our mission, vision, and values. And I want to thank each and every one of them for all that they do each and every day. Thank you for your interest in Anthem, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "Thank you. You know, our Medicaid business is continuing to perform well. We are very respectful that our states are going through a very challenging time in light of the pandemic, but we've been working very closely with them to make sure that the rates that we're receiving are actuarially sound and taking a view with respect to the long-term. If you know, we are at a point now, where roughly 50% of our states have already renewed and our states that renew in the second half of the year with respect to rates, we're engaged in conversations with them right now. You know, as you know, this is really an iterative process. We work very closely with our state partners to make sure that we achieve actuarially sound rates, but have been very mindful of the consequences of the pandemic and the recovery that needs to follow. So, as we think about 2022, we are very optimistic about being able to deliver performance within our target margin range of 2% to 4%. And we'll continue to work closely with our state partners during this time. Thank you. Yes, thank you for that question, Rob. And I will say Gail hit it well. We found this to be a very valuable asset for us from a Medicare Advantage perspective. But we certainly see the opportunity to take a look at the ability to scale this across other parts of government business as well. As you know, our duals are a key platform for us when we take a look at the opportunity for growth in our government business. [Indiscernible] populations will be continued areas focus for us as we go forward. So this is an example of an opportunity for us to leverage this internally, but also across the blue partnerships that we have in government business and Medicare, as well as Medicaid. So thank you very much for that question."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.71 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.01 growth of over 8% year-over-year. Our first quarter results reflect the execution of our enterprise strategy, while continuing to navigate through the pandemic.  We ended the quarter with medical membership totaling 43.5 million members, an increase of 1.4 million lives, or 3.3% year-over-year, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our risk-based membership grew by 1.8 million members over the prior year quarter, driven primarily by organic growth in Medicaid, aided by the suspension of re-verifications. In addition, our Medicare Advantage membership grew by 197,000 lives or 15% year-over-year, in-line with our expectations, and on track to achieve low double digit growth for the full year. This growth was partially offset by negative in-group change within our commercial fee-based business, which was to be expected given the economic challenges presented by the pandemic. From a membership reporting perspective, please note that we have changed our presentation to delineate commercial risk-based and fee-based membership, and included a table looking back to the first quarter of 2020 in our press release for modeling purposes. Our overall growth in membership despite challenging economic backdrop reflects resilience and value of our core benefits businesses as our significant presence in both commercial and [Medicare] continue to complement one another well. First quarter operating revenue of $32.1 billion increased 9% over the prior year quarter or approximately 11% when excluding the impact of the permanent repeal of the health insurer fee. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare and growth in our pharmacy product revenue. The medical loss ratio for the first quarter was 85.6%, an increase of 140 basis points over the first quarter of 2020 driven by cost associated with COVID-19, including testing and vaccine administration cost, and to a lesser extent, the permanent repeal of the HIF. Adjusted for the HIF, our first quarter MOR would have decreased by 10 basis points. Relative to our expectations, the cost of COVID-related care developed favorably driven by an earlier and sharper decline in COVID hospitalizations than we had anticipated. This was partially offset by a faster recovery and non-COVID cost, in-part due to the accelerated roll-out of the vaccine, as well as the impact of an extra calendar day in the first quarter of 2020. Medical claims payable for 2020 dates of service, or prior year reserve development also developed better than our expectations, but were entirely offset by reserve reestablishment. Or first quarter SG&A expense ratio came in at 12.2%, a decrease of 60 basis points relative to the first quarter of 2020.  Excluding the effects of the HIF, our SG&A ratio would have increased by 60 basis points, driven by increased spending to support growth, including our ongoing efforts to become a digital first enterprise, partially offset by the leverage against the growth in our operating revenue. The investments we're making today will be key to achieving greater operating efficiency over the long-term, and will enable us to achieve our 11% to 12% SG&A ratio target by 2025. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 41.6%, up from 38.7% at year-end 2020. The increase was due to debt raised in the quarter to fund our pending acquisitions and refinance and upcoming maturity. We continue to expect a debt to cap ratio to be slightly below 40% by the end of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $316.06 for approximately $447 million, representing slightly more than 25% of our full-year guidance. At this point, we continue to believe that our initial guidance of $1.6 billion in share repurchase remains appropriate for the full-year. We maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves in-light of the pandemic and its associated uncertainties. And as a result, days and claims payable increased by 3.5 days sequentially, ending the first quarter at 46.9 days, which is up 5 days year-over-year. Medical claims payable increased nearly 25% year-over-year, compared with premium growth of approximately 9%. Finally, our operating cash flow during the first quarter was $2.5 billion or 1.5 times net income better than expected and yet another indication of our strong quality of earnings. Note that operating cash flow as a percentage of net income will drop later in the year as we make payments on the multi-district litigation settlement and satisfy certain [MLR or collar payments]. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance. And as a result, we have raised our full-year outlook for adjusted earnings per share by $0.60 from greater than $24.50 to greater than $25.10. The raise in our guidance reflects both the upside from strong core performance in the first quarter, and the approximate $0.30 benefit associated with the extension of the sequestration holiday through the end of the year, partially offset by higher vaccine administration cost and the ongoing uncertainty around the pandemic. Our full-year outlook continues to embed net cost associated with COVID in the order of $600 million. Despite this headwind, we are pleased to be on track to deliver growth and adjusted earnings per share inside our long-term annual target range of 12% to 15%. While our core businesses perform well during the quarter, we remain cognizant of the risks and uncertainties associated with the pandemic. Notably, the potential for a prolonged fourth wave, new COVID variants, pent-up demand for healthcare services, and the potential for higher acuity episodes of care associated with a deferral of procedures throughout the pandemic. Our updated guidance contemplates all these factors and we are pleased to pass through much of the upside in the first quarter, despite a cautious, but prudent approach to forecasting the balance of this year. With much of our guidance raise reflecting the first quarter outperformance, we now expect between 52% and 54% of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to occur in the first half of the year. Given a faster roll-out of the vaccine, we expect non-COVID utilization to rebound sooner, and we now expect to absorb higher COVID vaccination administration cost during the second quarter. As a result, we are currently modeling our second quarter [MLR] to be near the midpoint of our full-year outlook of 88%, plus or minus 50 basis points.  And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions. Thank you for the questions, Justin, and good morning. This is John. So, I'll start out with the reserve question in the prior period development, you know, the $1.5 billion number looks like a big number, but you know, please note that the presentation is on a gross basis. And that number in a vacuum can be somewhat misleading. You know, a large percentage of that release will never hit the income statement.  I'm sure you know that as reserves are released, you know, some of the items impact MLR rebates and collars, risk corridor calculations, and we're funding mechanisms with some of our contractual provisions. But most importantly, we believe that we have reestablished the reserves to be uncertainty associated with COVID. And, you know, consistent with that maybe a question, you know, I will affirm that we believe that there is no net benefit to the first quarter associated with the PYD that was going through the statements this quarter, [with that]. Thank you, Lance. I appreciate the question. So, first of all, I think our approach to the capital deployment is remaining consistent. We're looking to take approximately 50% of our free cash flow and utilize it for reinvestment in the business, as well as M&A and their deployment activities close to 30% for share buyback and 20% as dividends directly return back to the shareholders. And we obviously want to be very opportunistic and advantages associated with that, but, you know with that, I think Gail wanted to make a couple comments on your specific question. Thank you, David, for that one lengthy question. See, if I can respond to all of the items that you've focused on. You know, in terms of the claims versus the visibility, we obviously track that very, very closely. You know, we're evaluating pre-served, pre-authorization information on a daily basis, certainly understand that. We're looking at the types of care that are deferred versus those that are not deferred, and trying to assess that associated with, you know, the core underlying businesses. You know, it's still a little bit too early to have a noticeable shift in non-COVID utilization. But as I said, we continue to closely monitor our markets as vaccination rates increase. And, you know, in terms of geographic, there's probably not a big disparity at this point associated with lines of business. You know, the senior population has been vaccinated sooner. And so we are seeing a significant decline in COVID in-patient associated with seniors, which means that the non-COVID can rebound a bit faster. We believe that we've totally factored that in. You know, people were still able to largely get care in 2020, after the stay at home mandates for ease. So, you know, the giant backlog we don't think is quite there, the same way, and there are natural systems capacities as well. And maybe just to focus on your reserves that question at the end, we believe our reserves are very prudently stated, and that they are associated with a lot of the unknowns and uncertainties associated with COVID as opposed to the other part of your question. So, thank you for that and hopefully that addresses all of your questions. Thanks for the question, Steve. You know, as we discussed last quarter, you know, $25.10 was the level of earnings that we felt best represented or normalized earnings power for 2021. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the 12% to 15% growth target off of that level beginning in 2022. You know, it's really too premature to get any more specific associated with 2022 at this point in time, but we do feel very good about the $25.10 representing our core earnings or normalized earnings power is a jumping off point. So, thank you for the question. Sure. No, thank you for the question. You know, Medicaid, certainly Medicaid is performing well. You know, we do believe that we have received appropriate [naturally sound] rates from our state partners. And we very much expect to end 2021 within our target margin ranges. Feel very, very good about Medicaid. On Medicare, maybe just to be very forthright about the Medicare business, finished the first quarter slightly below our target margin ranges, but largely for all the reasons that we've already identified. The elevated COVID cost, mostly in January impacted the senior population.  The reduction of the risk revenue did a suppressed 2020 utilization, which we've talked about in the last call is certainly impacting. And as you know, we have the continued payment of the 20%, DRG bump, and the 3.75% Medicare fee schedule increases impacting that line of business. But you know, those COVID factors are all transient. And, you know, we have great membership growth trajectory in Medicare, really improving that block of business, and we think that the future earnings potential for Medicare is significant and feel very, very good about the long-term aspects associated with Medicare. Thank you, Josh. I think it's still just a bit early to see any noticeable shift in non-COVID utilization and pent-up demand. We are seeing some of our states like Maine and Connecticut have some of the highest vaccination rates were Arkansas and Texas appear to be a bit lower. And there's really not a big material difference in utilization levels between those markets. And I think part of it has to do with the comment that I made earlier in the Q&A session, that, you know, folks were able to get access to care in 2020, you know when a lot of the stay at home rules were relaxed. So, at this point in time, you know, we are taking a very cautious approach, certainly monitoring all the variables. But you know, we still believe that our original outlook for utilization is appropriate and prudent. Thank you, Ricky. I'll start out by answering the beginning your question and turn it over to Pete to talk a little bit more about K Health and that aspect of your question, but you know, as you know that we continue to invest in new digital mobile capabilities to drive greater automation and enhance our customer experience, really, a lot of the consumer facing tools. You know, we're focused on improving the way we do business with our distribution partners. We have a new broker portal that offers distribution partners, a simplified digital platform to enable them to sell seamlessly. And we're standardizing our clinical and well-being solutions and the preset packages. Make it easier for our employers to understand and purchase the suite of products most relevant to your needs. So, I give those examples just to show you that your digital capabilities and digital investments are impacting every aspect of the company and every aspect of the business. You know, and that's with \u2013 also doing our system consolidation work that we've been focused on here for the last several years. In terms of the spending, you know, obviously, we did accelerate some spending here in the first quarter, but we will be spending on this throughout the year. The SG&A ratio will go down a little bit in the latter half of the year as our revenue accelerates, you know specifically when we go live with North Carolina Medicaid with some of the continued growth that we expect in core Medicaid with the special enrollment for ACA. All businesses have a drive to top line accordingly, but there's still a lot of spending left to be done in order to achieve our goals and expectations. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete to talk a little bit more about K Health. Thank you for the question, Kevin. And, as you pointed out, there are many moving parts associated with the guidance for the year. First quarter results of $7.01 were about $0.60 ahead of consensus estimates. And as you pointed out, the sequestration extension adds another $0.30 of upside. And then with all that, we also have the fourth wave of COVID as I've been more prolonged and anticipated. And also, just a month or so ago, we found out that we're required to increase the vaccine administration rates from $28 of those to $48 of those. You know, all-in with the, you know, with that core performance, we obviously feel very comfortable delivering the upside back to the shareholders and raising guidance, up to $25.10. In terms of core performance, you know, core performance is a lot of things. You know, it's the growth, you know, we've seen great core performance and better than expected in commercial, in Medicaid, in Ingenio, in Diversified Business Group, they're all doing very, very well. And, you know, we've seen growth in all those areas. You know, the medical cost, as we look at the costs that have been incurred, plus the expectation of pent-up demand, we feel good about that. And the SG&A efficiencies on a run rate basis after we pull out some of the investment spending. You know, so we're really very bullish about how well positioned we are and what the future holds. So, we've raised guidance accordingly. But thank you for the question."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning and welcome to Elevance Health's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined this morning on our earnings call by Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carillon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of some of the highlights of the quarter and year before turning to our recent announcement of the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana and a number of other updates on key strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook for 2023 in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevate Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered strong fourth quarter results, closing out another year of growth, consistent with our long-term targets and considerable progress in our transformation to become a lifetime trusted health partner. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP earnings per share of $3.93, and adjusted earnings per share of $5.23. For the full year, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $24.81 and adjusted earnings per share of $29.7 and reflecting growth of 15% year-over-year from our adjusted baseline of $25.20 in 2022. 2022 marks the fifth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate. This reflects the focused and sustained execution of our strategy to optimize our health benefits businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities, and accelerate capabilities and services. Elevance Health ended 2022, serving more than 47.5 million medical members, up nearly 2.2 million members year-over-year, including more than 1 million new commercial and over 1 million new government members, investments in enhancing the customer experience, delivering innovative, customized whole health solutions, deepening digital engagement, and prioritizing health equity, all helped to deliver strong growth across customer segments. Membership growth, coupled with expansion in both the scope and scale of Caroline's business with our health plans, helped to propel double-digit growth in CarelonRx and Carelon services. In total, for the year, Elevance Health produced nearly 14% growth in operating revenue and double-digit growth in adjusted operating earnings. Now, I'd like to discuss a number of recent developments, including the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana that we just announced on Monday. Like our Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield family of plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana is deeply rooted in its local community, serving Louisiana for almost 90 years. And like our health plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana is committed to improving the health and lives of the people of Louisiana. Our organizations are well aligned in our mission and purpose. And have worked together in partnership through our Healthy Blue Alliance, serving Medicaid and dual special needs plans in Louisiana for a number of years now. Upon closing, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana will be our 15th Blue state, providing us with deep local roots in a new market, while we bring national scale and access to our portfolio of innovative solutions and capabilities to support the community. We're looking forward to accelerating Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana strategy to make an even greater difference in the health and lives of the 1.9 million individuals they serve. Blue Cross some Blue Shield plans are at our best when we collaborate. Together, the Blue system provides health benefits to nearly 15 million consumers across all 50 states. There are many untapped opportunities to leverage our unique scale. One recent example is Synergy Medication Collective. Earlier this year, we became a founding investor in this new contracting organization founded by a group of Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliated companies. The collective focuses on improving affordability and access to medical specialty drugs that are injected or infused in a clinical setting. Synergy will seek best-in-class medical drug pricing, leveraging our collective industry-leading specialty drug spend to enhance affordability, and drive toward value-based care representing another example of Blue's partnering for progress. Inside Elevance Health, we are also directly addressing fast-growing areas of cost trend. In November, we announced the acquisition of BioPlus, the largest independent specialty pharmacy provider offering a complete range of specialty pharmacy services for patients living with complex and chronic conditions. BioPlus will enhance our ability to deliver on our whole health promise and enable us to leverage our resources and scale to deliver greater affordability and access to critical medications. Over time, it will allow us to bring specialty pharmacy fulfillment for our members in-house, at what is a dynamic time in this field, given the anticipated growth of biosimilars. Upon closing, BioPlus will become part of CarelonRx, our pharmacy services business that we rebranded at the beginning of this year, with the addition of specialty pharmacy, we will expand the scope of the services and capabilities inside of Carelon and by extension, the proportion of overall healthcare spending that we manage or address. The acquisition of BioPlus furthers our commitment to scaling healthcare services to address the needs of health plans beginning with our own. Of Carelon's nearly $41 billion of revenue in 2022, approximately 60% came from partnering with our health plans. Meanwhile, in 2022, Carelon achieved the goal we set at our March 2021 Investor Conference of managing at least 20% of our consolidated benefit expense by 2025. This is three years ahead of schedule, a testament to the growing suite of capabilities within Carelon. Carelon has made significant progress since our last investor conference. And we look forward to providing shareholders an update on our long-range planning at our next investor conference, which will be held on Thursday, March 23, 2023 in New York City. Increasingly, we are evaluating and growing our enterprise through two primary businesses; health benefits and healthcare services. And we're continuing down the path of scaling Carelon by addressing the needs of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health benefits businesses. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we will evolve our external reporting to better align with this approach and begin to report Carelon split between Carelon Rx and Carelon Services, while we combine our commercial and government health benefits operations for reporting purposes into a single health benefit segment. Our new reporting structure will allow stakeholders to more clearly track the progress we are making against our enterprise strategy and better reflect how we evaluate our business results against our enterprise strategy today. John will discuss this more in his remarks, and you can also find a pro forma view of quarterly and full year 2022 results, the new reporting structure at a supplemental table in this morning's press release. Now, I'd like to touch on a few recent highlights before discussing our outlook for 2023. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to become the first managed care organization in the nation to earn the full three-year health equity accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance for all of our own Medicaid health plans, covering nearly 90% of our Medicaid membership. This recognition demonstrates that focus and resolve yield results. We have long been dedicated to countering health and equities across our enterprise and through partnerships with care providers. We continue to work toward health equity through policy and practice in pursuit of better outcomes and experiences for all, and ultimately to improve the health of humanity. Our Medicaid team is prepared to uphold that commitment by ensuring access to care for underprivileged populations through continuity of coverage for all beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid, who will be subject to the eligibility redeterminations this year. We look forward to working alongside state partners to help minimize loss of coverage due to administrative challenges and to ensure beneficiaries no longer eligible for Medicaid understand their coverage options. Our ACA exchange plans are now being offered in almost every county in our 14 Blue states. We remain committed and prepared to ensure seamless transitions of those Medicaid members, as they move into exchange plans or employer-based coverage. Across our health plans, we are optimizing our businesses. The pandemic brought with it substantial uncertainties and that resulted in margin compression in our commercial and Medicare health plans in 2021 that we didn't recover in 2022. It has since become apparent that COVID costs are not going to zero. And as we discussed last year, we've been repricing our risk in our commercial business, and we are enjoying improved reimbursement rates risk adjustment revenue and star quality bonus payments in our Medicare Advantage business in 2023. With January 1 renewals behind us in commercial, and the 2023 Medicare Advantage plan year underway, we remain confident in the margin recovery previously discussed and for the improvement in our commercial and Medicare businesses to more than offset anticipated member attrition in our Medicaid business when redeterminations begin on April 1st. Our confidence in operating our Medicare Advantage business solidly inside our long-term 3% to 5% target margin range has been underpinned by our bid strategy, in which we took a balanced approach. While the AEP proved to be somewhat more competitive than we expected, we still expect to grow Medicare Advantage membership relatively close to our prior targeted growth rate in 2023. Turning now to our outlook for 2023. We expect adjusted earnings of greater than $32.60 per share, reflecting growth of over 12%. Our guidance reflects double-digit growth in operating earnings in each of our health benefits and Carelon businesses that will be driven by the focused execution of our enterprise strategy, to optimize our health benefits business, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate capabilities and services. Our outlook contemplates a range of outcomes on Medicaid redeterminations coverage shifts and retention and our expectation for commercial and Medicare margin recovery from pandemic aero loans. John will discuss our assumptions in greater detail. The strong growth we achieved in 2022 would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 100,000 associates. Our collective determination to improve lives and communities is unwavering, and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. I would like to thank them for the important work they do and the impact they make every day. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. We are pleased to have delivered solid fourth quarter financial results, closing out another strong year of growth for Elevance Health. The focused execution on our enterprise strategy continues to drive progress against our stated long-term targets. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.23 was ahead of our expectations and drove full-year adjusted earnings per share to $29.7, reflecting growth of over 15% year-over-year off of our adjusted 2021 baseline of $25.20 and above our long-term 12% to 15% annual earnings per share growth target. We ended the year with 47.5 million members, up $2.2 million or nearly 5% year-over-year, with organic growth having comprised more than 85% of our overall increase. In the fourth quarter, medical membership grew by 248,000 members, led by growth in Medicaid, driven in large part by the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and the acquisition of Vivida Health, which added 29,000 Medicaid members. For the full year, we added 1.1 million net new commercial members and 1.1 million net new government members. Total operating revenue for the year was nearly $156 billion, an increase of approximately 14% over the prior year, reflecting solid growth in our health benefits businesses and continued momentum in Carelon. We are pleased with the progress made to accelerate our service capabilities during the year as Carelon Rx and Carelon services grew revenue by 12% and 27% over 2021, respectively. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 89.4%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2021. This strong performance includes an improvement in commercial underwriting margin and also benefited from the reclassification of certain quality improvement expenses. These improvements were partially offset by the Medicaid business, which carries a higher benefit expense ratio than our commercial and Medicare health plans. Elevance Health's SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 11.5% and 11.4% for the full year reflecting an improvement of 20 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year. These positive results include the negative impact on the SG&A ratio related to aligning certain quality improvement expenses with CMS guidelines. The overall improvement was driven primarily by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue. In 2022, we produced another year of strong operating cash flow of $8.4 billion, representing 1.4 times net income, which was significantly better than our outlook to start the year and was driven by stronger risk-based membership growth and maintaining a prudent balance sheet. Additionally, relative to our initial guidance, a shift in the timing of certain payments to state-based partners added over $500 million to the fourth quarter operating cash flow that we now expect that we will pay in the first quarter of 2023. We ended 2022 with a debt-to-cap ratio of 39.9%, in line with our expectations and within our targeted range. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for $567 million. For the year, we repurchased 4.8 million shares for $2.3 billion, exceeding our initial outlook for 2022, as we took advantage of the volatile periods in the market and opportunistically repurchase shares. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable ended the year at 47.7 days, an increase of 2.5 days year-over-year, and stable with the third quarter. Medical claims payable grew over 15% year-over-year compared to premium revenue growth of 13.5%. In summary, 2022 was a very strong year. We grew adjusted earnings per share by over 15%. We grew operating gain by nearly 13%. We grew membership by 2.2 million, and we grew revenue by nearly 14%, all with a stable medical loss ratio, a 2.5-day increase in days in claims payable and operating cash flow of $8.4 billion or 1.4 times net income. Before turning to our 2023 outlook, I would like to provide more detail on our decision to adapt our external segment reporting to better align with our enterprise strategy. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we will begin to disclose Carelon as a separate business division and provide operating revenue, operating gain and operating margin information separately for Carelon Services and Carelon Rx. Carelon offers a diverse suite of services across behavioral health, advanced analytics and services, complex care, pharmacy services and digital assets, and we remain committed to expanding the scale and scope of services Carelon provides to our own and third-party health plans. As we've continued down the path of scaling Carelon by addressing the needs of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health benefits businesses, it's become increasingly apparent that the similarities between our health plans have evolved to outnumber the differences. And we have also decided to combine our employer, individual, Medicare, Medicaid health plans and products into a single health benefits division. The remaining segment, Corporate and Other will include a small amount of revenue and earnings from non-Carelon, non-health benefits businesses, as well as our corporate unallocated expenses. The new health benefits segment will combine the same group of businesses that currently comprises the commercial and specialty and government business divisions. In the Carelon Services segment, reflects the same group of businesses that comprised the diversified business group, now Carelon services, which has historically been included as part of our old other segment. We are excited to begin disclosing the performance of our two primary and distinct businesses in a manner more consistent with how we will grow our enterprise for years to come and to be doing so at the time of strength for our organization. As you can see, our commercial health plan margin recovery is well underway and will extend into 2023, which is reflected in our Health Benefits segment margin guidance provided in our press release this morning. To ensure a smooth transition to our new reporting structure, we have also included a supplemental table in this morning's press release, showing our quarterly and full year 2022 results pro forma for new reporting structure alongside new supplemental performance metrics for CarelonRx and Carelon services that can be used to model revenue for each business. Our commitment to elevating whole health and advancing health beyond health care is unwavering, and our new segment reporting structure will allow our stakeholders to more clearly track the progress we're making against our enterprise strategy. Now, I'd like to discuss our outlook for 2023 in greater detail. We are pleased to have provided initial earnings per share guidance of greater than $32.60, reflecting growth of over 12% year-over-year, putting us on track to produce a sixth consecutive year of growth in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our long-term 12% to 15% compound annual growth rate target. 2023 will be a year of optimization, but we will also demonstrate the balance and resilience of our health benefits businesses as we execute the planned recovery of our commercial and Medicare health plan margins from pandemic era low's, which we expect will more than offset the impact of membership attrition and margin normalization in our Medicaid business when eligibility redeterminations resume. For 2023, we anticipate growth in medical membership despite commercial repricing and Medicaid redeterminations. Commercial risk-based membership is expected in 2023, up over 200,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 4.9 million to 5.1 million members. Growth will be driven by individual and small group risk-based membership, partially offset by attrition in our large group risk business, driven by the repricing discussed earlier. Note that we expect commercial risk-based membership to decline by approximately 60,000 in the first quarter, with individual up approximately 100,000 and group risk-based membership down approximately 160,000. We anticipate growth in individual and group risk-based membership over the balance of the year, concentrated in the second half, as consumers transition from Medicaid to commercial coverage. Fee-based membership is expected to grow by approximately 600,000 members at the midpoint to 27.1 million to 27.4 million at year-end 2023. The wider-than-normal range contemplates a variety of scenarios related to coverage shifts out of Medicaid, and into employer-sponsored plans and the relatively uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We expect approximately one-third of this growth to occur in the first quarter with the balance more heavily concentrated in the back half of the year as consumer's transition from Medicaid to commercial coverage. Total commercial membership will end the year in the range of 32 million to 32.5 million members, up over 800,000 members at the midpoint. Medicare Advantage membership is expected to grow by approximately 75,000 to 125,000 members, with growth in both individual and group pushing our membership over the 2 million member mark. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 10.8 million to 11.3 million, driven by the attrition associated with eligibility redeterminations beginning on April 1 of this year. This wider-than-normal range contemplates a range of scenarios on the pace of redeterminations and the prospect of macroeconomic headwinds developing over the course of 2023. And finally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits memberships will be relatively stable year-over-year. In total, medical membership is expected to end 2023 in the range of 47.4 million to 48.5 million, reflecting growth of over 400,000 members at the midpoint. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 87.2% in 2023, plus or minus 50 basis points, an improvement of approximately 20 basis points compared with 2022, primarily driven by the re-pricing of commercial risk-based business and margin expansion in Medicare Advantage, related to the improved reimbursement levels across rates, risk adjustment and star quality performance. The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 11.2%, plus or minus 50 basis points, a reduction of 20 basis points at the midpoint driven by expense leverage associated with growth in operating revenue, partially offset by continued growth in our Carelon businesses, which carry higher SG&A ratio than our health benefits business. We expect operating gain for the year to be greater than $9.35 billion, reflecting growth of at least 10% over 2022, again, being the primary driver of growth in adjusted earnings per share. Below the line, we expect investment income to be approximately $1.6 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1 billion, both reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. And our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%. Our full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $7.6 billion, including the unfavorable impact of a timing delay on the payment of approximately $500 million to certain Medicaid state partners that we previously believed we would pay in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusting for timing, our 2023 cash flow outlook will be greater than $8.1 billion or approximately 1.1 times our expected GAAP net income. We expect full year share repurchases of approximately $2 billion, and our weighted average fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be in the range of 239 million to 240 million shares outstanding. Our 2023 guidance does not include the pending acquisition of BioPlus or Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, which we expect will close later in the year. Importantly, neither is expected to have a material impact on earnings in 2023. At the segment level, we expect the Health Benefit segment operating revenue to grow in the mid to upper single-digit percentage range year-over-year in 2023, with segment operating margin up 25 to 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect CarelonRx revenue to grow in the upper single-digit percentage range with low single-digit growth in adjusted scripts and mid single-digit growth in revenue per adjusted script. And we expect Carelon Services to grow revenue in the low double-digit range organically, excluding all pending or unannounced M&A, driven by growth in revenue per consumer served, as we expect consumer serve to grow in the low single-digit range from 105 million at year-end 2022. Carelon Services operating margin is expected to expand by 25 to 50 basis points year-over-year in 2023. With respect to earnings seasonality, we are projecting similar profitability patterns to historical ranges and expect to earn slightly more than 55% of our full year adjusted earnings per share in the first half of the year with slightly more than half of that in the first quarter, consistent with current consensus modeling of seasonality. Finally, we remain committed to enhancing shareholder returns through capital deployment, including share repurchases and dividends and are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors recently approved a 16% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $1.48 per share, our 12th consecutive annual increase, which will be paid on March 24 and to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10. In closing, 2022 was another year of strong growth for Elevance Health as we continue down the path of transforming from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime, trusted health partner, and we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth in line with our long-term targets in 2023. We look forward to discussing our enterprise strategy and long-term financial targets at our upcoming investor conference, which we will host in New York City on Thursday, March 23, 2023. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Thanks. And can you talk a little bit about, the growth in the services business, which is really interesting. Both org changes that you're intending to put in place to kind of support the new segment reporting, if any? And then, in the Care delivery aspect of that, can you just talk a little bit about what you've been doing to date with some of your partnerships with Aledade and Privia and how that's kind of being deployed in the market and what your expectations are for care delivery long term?\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Lance. Let me frame a little bit of what you asked, and then I'll ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to give you a little bit more color on that. First, in terms of org structure, we've actually been building our team over the last 18 months, and Pete's done a really strong job of both, bringing individuals who are in the services industry to Carelon, but also taking individuals from our health benefits business, who have a deep understanding of that business and having them lead. So we feel we've got a really good mix of talent and have been building our bench strength pretty effectively. So we don't envision any structural changes, obviously, as acquisitions come in, they fit into the verticals that we've shared as part of our strategy. So let me just have Pete comment a little bit about -- a little bit more about Carelon and our growth there.\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. No, thanks a lot Gail. Thanks a lot, Lance, for the question. Overall, as Gail said, we're really pleased with the momentum and performance that we saw in 2022. And as Gail noted, in the year, we did do a lot around restructuring. We obviously went through rebranding, which there was a lot of excitement around. And as she said, we infused a lot of new talent across the organization. And then, in terms of the infrastructure we built internally, we're very focused. As you know, a core part of our strategy is focused on internal growth and serving Elevance affiliated health plans. And so we built the infrastructure to engage, to a much better degree, with our associates and partners internally. And we're seeing really good progress there. I hope you can see that through the numbers and the improvement in the year. We remain keenly focused on whole health and improving the patient experience. That's something else that we're very focused on looking from the outside in, in terms of the patient experience. And I'd say the other thing that we've been really focused on internally, and we're trying to change the culture, and its working, is driving more risk and capitation through the portfolio. And that has really helped in terms of the acceleration of our growth and the innovation that we're seeing going forward. As it relates to your question on some of the care delivery partnerships. We're seeing really good progress there. Again, when you look at the assets within Carelon, it can add a lot of value to our partners. And so, we continue to look to wrap around those services and create incremental value. And as we look forward, we have that in mind as well. When we talk to our provider base partners, where are they feeling stressed, where can we support them. So there's a lot of opportunity that we got going forward.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Pete. And Lance, specifically, in terms of how we're deploying, we see those partnerships and some of the investments we've made as part of our overall value-based care strategy. Our penetration has been strong, we're around 63% driven by purposeful collaboration. Those are two really good examples. We continue to learn and improve that approach, and part of that is how we work closely with Carelon to capitate services and actually, I think, impact more of the health care dollar and impact more of overall services. But we feel really confident about the strategy that we've deployed. And as I've shared before on these calls, we know that sharing -- the downside risk is really the most important part of where we need to achieve better outcomes. And so we're continuing to grow those arrangements, Early days still, but we feel good about the partnerships that we have, and we continue to expand them, and we feel on track to deliver on the goals that we've shared previously at our Investor Day, but also in these calls. So thanks very much for the question and next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Congratulations on the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana deal. It's been quite a while since we've seen one of those. My big recollection is the approval process and navigating the regulatory side of things can be a little tricky. Can you give us a sense of any discussions you have with the states at this point and your confidence level? I know you're saying by year-end close. And John, you mentioned that it wouldn't be meaningful to this year's numbers. I'm assuming that's partly due to late closure. But is it -- can we say that it would be accretive? Is there anything you can say financially about it? And then the last aspect of this is, obviously, there's a lot of changing things related to the Blues generally with the antitrust settlement, et cetera. Are you seeing more discussions, Gail, as you're out there, or is there more interest in collaboration, maybe we could see a broader upswing in activity?\nGail Boudreaux : Well, thank you, A.J. That was a very comprehensive set of questions, and let me try to kind of go through them. First, we really are excited about the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Louisiana. As you said, it's been some time since one of these has occurred. But I think as you think about like the driver for this, this is very much a strategic acquisition. The Board of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, really wanted to have a greater impact and accelerate the strategy that they put in place. This is a solidly run plan, 4.5-star Medicare plan. And I think those are really important things as you think about this acquisition. The other thing that I think is really important for us is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana very much aligns with our strategy. They're deeply rooted in their local communities. They -- as we shared, they've served Louisiana for more than 90 years. Our mission and purpose is well aligned. And we've had a healthy Blue Alliance partnership with them that serves our Medicaid and dual special needs plans for a number of years now. So we've worked together culturally, I think there's a great alignment there. And the other thing is we're excited because this brings the 15th Blue state. So we can -- just as we have in our other 14, we've kept our deep local roots in a new market, but we also can bring our national scale and access to our portfolio of innovative solutions and capabilities, again, accelerating what the Blue Cross Blue Shield strategic focus has been, and that supports the community. And I think accelerates their strategy and making an even greater difference in impact on the 1.9 million lives. In terms of closing, this will be subject to the normal closing conditions. And as we shared, we believe that we expect the deal to close in the second half of 2023. So again, not much more there. We do feel the impact that we can have on the community and the citizen in Louisiana with the foundation, accelerate Louisiana really is a strong component of this and helps accelerate health care status, accessibility, affordability as well as health equity, and those are areas that we've been deeply investing and committed to as well. In terms of collaborations, you heard that we've done a number of collaborations and feel good about the Synergy Medical Collective, which is a great example of all of us coming together around medical specialty and again, with an alignment and focus around fundamentally improving affordability. We have 150 million Americans that we serve across this country. And we feel that ability for us to work together to have an even greater impact, again, on access and affordability is really important. And I would just point to that as an example. So, thank you very much for the question. I think we, again, are excited about this. We think it's a great collaboration for us and feel that there's an opportunity for us to work together and for us to obviously use Carelon to help support the advancement of all Blues. So thanks very much. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please, go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to check in, in 2022, you did about 7% margin in that commercial business. I know you're not reporting it specifically anymore. But you had 11% target out there for 2025. I wanted to check in on that target and just find out if that is still what you're expecting to do by 2025. Maybe you could share with us how much progress you're making towards that in 2023? And then give us -- I'm sure there's an offset there in terms of more conservatism on the Medicaid side from a margin perspective. Can you share what you -- where you expect your Medicaid margins to be versus the 2% to 4% target you have out there long term? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Justin. Good morning. And we do appreciate the questions. In terms of commercial, we're actually doing very, very well. We have a repricing effort going on that began on July 1 of 2022. And what we had seen was, the overall cost structure of the commercial market was higher than we had assumed. And so, this repricing was about 25% of the large group block in July. And then we repriced about 50% of the block here on January 1, 2023, and it was really to ensure that the premiums more accurately reflect the underlying cost structure of the book. The result of that would be margin recovery associated with that. We feel very good about the progress that we're making, and we still stand by the commitments that were made in our prior Investor Day to get the commercial margins up to the level that we had estimated by 2025. You have to look at now the health services segment in total. And as you had asked, we have the commercial margin improvement ongoing, we will have Medicare margin improvement, as our risk adjusters are really recovering, risk-adjusted revenue really recovering from pandemic era lows. Also, we do have 74% of our MA membership in 4-star plans or above for the 2023 payment year. And we believe our Medicare Advantage business will be solidly within the target margin range of 3% to 5%. And then, on Medicaid, which was your final question, we've been working very closely with our state partners on Medicaid and feel very good about the rating actions. And that the rates are actuarially sound rates and feel very good about that. However, we were making either at or above the high end of our range here in the last couple of years, which obviously resulted in MLR collars and various other rebates being paid back to the states. We expect that the Medicaid business will be solidly within the 2% to 4% range, closer to the high end, but still with actuarial equivalent rates. So hopefully, that helps clarify all that. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. On Carelon, you mentioned that you hit the target for 20% of benefit expense through Carelon ahead of schedule. Could you talk about how much higher this percentage can go from here with your current capabilities? And then specifically on the outlook for 2023. The revenue guidance for Carelon Services came in a bit below your long-term target. How are you thinking about growth from here just given the progress that you've made? And will more growth come from external customers going forward? Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Nathan. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian provide a little perspective. And as we shared earlier, we are going to be updating our long-term planning at our Investor Day in March. So we probably won't go into like where we think our updated guidance is on that, but we can certainly give you some color on how each of the components are playing and feel very good about the progress that Carelon overall is making. So Pete?\nPeter Haytaian : Yes. No, thanks for the question, Nathan. As it relates to 2023, just to be clear, and John noted this in the prepared remarks, the low double-digit range growth in 2023 is really organic growth. It does not include M&A. I think if you look at our recent history, there's been a lot of M&A that's contributed meaningfully to us. And we're being very intentional about that. We're very focused on it. It's something that we'll continue to do. And I think it's an important part of our growth strategy going forward. As Gail said, in terms of the amount of medical spend that we penetrate, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but we're really encouraged with our trajectory right now. We feel like we can continue to grow pretty significantly. There's a lot of white space internally. So a lot of opportunity there. But to your point about external growth, we did establish some new leadership. We've got a new infrastructure in terms of external growth. We're very focused, as Gail said, you've heard a lot about the Blues and Blue partnerships, and we're very encouraged of what we're seeing in terms of the Blue opportunity. So we do think we can see nice growth externally as well. But again, our first focus is on the affiliated health plans and creating value there first.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just I had two follow-ups on the Blues topic. The first is if you can maybe give us some color on the incremental revenue you expect to drive from the BCBSLA Louisiana acquisition because obviously, you already have some revenues that you're generating off of Healthy Blue. Then also maybe just an update on the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota situation, I think that, that relationship on the Medicaid side will term at the beginning of 2024. Just any update on membership or financial impact that you expect from that situation as well? Thank you.\nJohn Gallina : Yes, sure. Thank you, Scott, for the question. So associated with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana. As we had stated, we're not expecting that to close until later in [Technical Difficulty] impact on 2023 will not be material, really data line items. However, assuming it does close in 2023 -- in 2024, what we should see is an incremental 1.6 million members after you eliminate the various double counts and you referenced the significant partnership we have with them already. So it's an incremental 1.6 million members. And it's really -- it's an incremental $4.5 billion in revenue on top of what we have now. So that's really about the high-level economics that we would expect to inure in 2024.\nGail Boudreaux: I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood to comment on Minnesota.\nFelicia Norwood: Yes. Good morning, Scott, and thank you for the question on Minnesota. We operate over 27 Medicaid plans across the country with over 11.5 million members. And when you think about what we do, we bring very deep expertise in this business and a relentless focus on our whole health strategy, health equity and improving health outcomes. The expertise we bring to the table has been recognized by our external partners, and we really look forward to continuing to bring that experience to other Blue partners and alliances, not only in Medicaid, but in Medicare as well. When I think about our alliance relationships, each of them is very different. And Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota decided to end our administrative services relationship, which supported about 330,000 Medicaid members and provide back-office services in-house. We're going to work with them to make sure that there's a seamless transition, because at the core of what we do, we want to make sure our members are taking care of, and that's our highest priority. So we continue to value alliance relationships and really look forward to continued growth in this segment, with partners who value the deep expertise that we bring to the table for serving vulnerable and complex populations. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Felicia. And Scott, that will be in January 24, just from a timing perspective. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks, very much. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on utilization expectations for 2023. John, you made the comment that COVID is not going away, I agree that, that should be in the baseline. But, as we think about this, do you feel like there's any level of pent-up demand or potentially higher acuity levels as we move into 2023? And would you call out any specific line of business?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the question Lisa and we're not discussing specific trend assumption for 2023, but really when you look at some of the cost drivers that we have relative to the expectations, emergency room has been favorable, in-patient has been favorable, pharmacy cost actually running a little bit higher than expected. And out-patient is running a little bit higher than expected. I don\u2019t know that we really see any pent-up demand as much as we see -- being as much as the new normal. But just to reiterate. The overall cost structure of the business is higher than if COVID had never occurred. COVID is here and it continues to be a cost driver. What I think is probably most important in all of this is that our pricing now reflects the underlying cost structure and our MLR guidance also reflects this higher cost structure. So we actually feel very well positioned going into 2023. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please, go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess, my question is going to be really on 2024. So if you can make a direct comment on that, that would be great. But if not, at least comment on the 2023 trajectory to give us a little bit of a sense, because it seems like the story here for 2023 is balanced portfolio improvements in commercial and Medicare are offsetting Medicaid. But obviously, the Medicaid pressure is one that builds throughout the year, both from a revenue and I would think, from an MLR pressure perspective, which begs the question about whether it's a bigger headwind in 2024 than it is in 2023 and whether there are similar opportunities in 2024 to kind of to offset that? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina : Yes. Thank you for the question, Kevin. And as you indicated in your question, we're not going to provide any specific details we did on 2024. Obviously, at our Investor Day coming up here in a few months, we'll provide a lot more long-term aspirations. But I think the way you've characterized 2023 is correct. It's really -- it's a year of optimizing our health benefits business, while we continue to grow and expand the capabilities within Carelon. And then you talk about, well, gee, could the headwind be greater? As you look at the Medicaid redeterminations, there's certainly a lot of variables associated with the pace and timing, on a state-by-state basis, where they go, which lines of business, they ultimately reside in I think one of the great things about the balance and resilience of our membership base is that we end up with the members somewhere. We have a product offering for every member regardless of age, regardless of employment status, with regardless of health condition, and feel very, very good. So we do expect approximately about half of the Medicaid members to be reverified here in this calendar year and the other half next year. So there is some balance there. But at the end of the day, we are very well positioned to retain much of that membership. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux : Yes, thanks, John. And Kevin, I think it's an insightful question because as you've heard us talk about, I think there's three core pillars of how we see our business evolving. Optimizing our health benefits business. It's highly scaled. We're very diversified in that business. And again, as you think about 2023, we have an opportunity for margin recovery, which is really we've been intensely focused on. But the other two pillars, I think, are really important about our future growth, which is investing in growth opportunities. And then third, accelerating services and capabilities, particularly through Carelon. And remember, as we think about Carelon, a lot of that is synergistic with our health plan business. We've continued to grow this and that allows the synergy to also occur with Carelon services as well as expanding capabilities that you've seen us, but through organically and inorganically. So overall, I think we've got more levers than we've ever had historically, and those positioned us well for the balance that John just shared. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter : Hi. Good morning. It'd be great if you could expand a little bit on the dynamics you saw in Medicare Advantage open enrollment this year. And how you think those trends might play out over the next couple? And then specifically, hoping to clarify the enrollment expectations there. I think you said 75,000 to 100,000 membership growth. Is that a sequential Q1 figure or year-end figure just trying to realign versus some of the previous expectations you've shared here. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux : Sure, I'll have Felicia Norwood, who leads that business, to share her comments.\nFelicia Norwood : So, good morning and thank you for that question. When we think about Medicare Advantage, as Gail mentioned in her early remarks, we took a very strategic approach as we thought about our bids for 2023, and we expect to deliver good performance in terms of growth, not just in individual, but also in group. As John referenced, we plan to grow between 75,000 and 125,000. But we did end up encountering a very competitive. On the other hand, we had very solid growth in our D-SNP business, which is where we've had a focus for some period of time. And I think that positions us well for the rest of OEP in the remainder of 2023. As we think about our competitiveness, we have a very strong benefit portfolio, and we believe that we're positioned well in order to continue to grow this business. So at the end of the day, a competitive environment, which it always will be in Medicare Advantage, but still an opportunity to grow in a business that we feel very good about. And most importantly, the opportunity is we are in 2023 to deliver very strong margin recovery and operate squarely within our 3% to 5% pre-tax target margin range in this business, so solid growth and solid margins in 2023.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please, go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide an update on some of the trends you're seeing in value-based care. I heard some of the comments earlier. But as you go into 2023, are there any changes in the dynamics of the industry? Any changes specify in contracting terms that either the providers are looking for or that you're trying to push? And then, maybe any updated views on the employment or ownership of physicians or physician groups.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of -- a little bit consistent, I guess, with what I shared before on value-based care, I mean, we've been -- we continue, quite frankly, to refine and improve our strategy. We feel we're making really good progress on it. What we're seeing is a lot more interest in sharing up and downside risk. Historically, value-based care was more upside risk and we've gotten about 63%. We've gone -- we've continued to refine that to now include much more downside risk. And also, I think one of the biggest differences is the sharing of data bilaterally and much more timely. So that action can be taken in -- I think, in a much more integrated way. And we're doing a lot of work with that with our care providers. It's embedded. And also, what happens, like, post primary care. So how do we manage all the specialty services? That's a big part of the Carelon strategy in terms of what Pete is doing in his business. So as I think about that, I would say, structurally, we're seeing a lot more interest and a lot more conversation as this takes several years for, I think, physician practices to get comfortable with value-based care. And so, we're building credibility with that. We're getting better at our reporting and our engagement. And we're not only doing it across Medicare Advantage, and I think that is one of the changes. Some of our relationships are specific to commercial, for example, and that's a very different approach, including with some fee-based customers. So that would be a trend. In terms of the ownership of physicians, I think, we've been very consistent about that. We do own physicians in terms of our integrated health plans, and those have performed very well in MMM and health fund in Florida. I think, CareMore is beginning to become even more integrated with the work we're doing. So I think our strategy has stayed very consistent there. So I don't really have any significant updates, other than I think it's all embedded and our ability to drive more downside risk integrate data in a much more real-time basis. And then, really become true partners and train each other and how do we work in a value-based care environment. As, I think, you know well, this doesn't happen overnight, and it takes quite a bit of work for us on both sides to be committed to the long-term partnership, but we feel good, and we're seeing more enrollment in those partnerships. And the results have been good. We see differentiated quality and cost outcomes. So thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please, go ahead.\nRob Cottrell: Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Just on the CarelonRx or PBM, how should we square the high single-digit outlook for 2023 relative to your long-term 2025 low double-digit outlook? And then also, can you provide a bit more color on what Carelon's role will be within the synergy collective? Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux : I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian to address that, please.\nPeter Haytaian : Yes. Thanks. In terms of the short-term, if you're referencing the script growth, overall, we're going to see nice script growth in Medicare and commercial. In terms of the headwind to that, really, that's due to the Medicaid dynamic around reverifications, or redeterminations. And then overall, we're going to see lower COVID vaccination. So that doesn't impact operating gain, but that is really the reason for the difference in the numbers in terms of what you're seeing short-term, long-term. In terms of overall growth, though, we feel really good about how we're doing in the pharmacy business. There continues to be a lot of interest in our integrated value proposition. In 2022, we're coming off a good year. We saw a 300% improvement in net membership growth. So that was good in terms of penetrating our self-funded business. And we're seeing that continue to play through into 2023. We're obviously through a lot of the selling for the beginning of the year, what we did see is we saw a lot more activity and penetration in the 10,000 or less business. We saw RFPs up by about 6% year-over-year. And again, I'll reiterate, but this is a segment an area that we perform really, really well in. I think you referenced a synergy at the end of your question. And again, to Gail's point in our commentary, our focus, a big part of our strategy is overall affordability and choice and this creates an opportunity for us in the context of medical specialty to create more affordability for our members. Again, by working in conjunction with the Blues across 100 million Americans, those that are utilizing specialty on the medical side, we have an opportunity to create much greater affordability. So we look forward to that. That work is in earnest right now in 2023 with value potentially playing through into 2024.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo : Hey, just on the topic of health plan optimization and commercial repricing initiatives. Can you comment maybe more specifically on stop loss? I think, you guys are beginning to anniversary some of the challenges in the creep and high-cost claims last year, just how you feel about trends in the business margins, just maybe broadly, any comments about the overall stop-loss market? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux : Sure, Whit. I'm going to have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our commercial business, give you some perspective there.\nMorgan Kendrick : Hi, there, and Whit, thank you for the question. Regarding the stop-loss business, that's certainly an area that was underperforming priorly and we began that journey to recover the margins in that business back in January of last year. It started with some of our integrated -- our external business rather. And then year progressed further, we had our July cohort, which John mentioned earlier, which was about 25 [ph] to some of our integrated business, both stop loss and risk-based business. Both of those went through a repricing exercise midyear, and then that concluded with January. So regarding the stop-loss market, we feel very good about it. We've got continued strong penetration, but opportunity to continue to grow that, both on our internal integrated business as well as our external. And we feel at this point in time, we have right-priced our business based on risk and we'll continue doing that so very fastidiously as we move through in 2023.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. You called out a headwind to the MLR this year from the growth, the outsized growth in Medicaid did not call out a benefit to the SG&A ratio in 2022 from that. I'm wondering if there was one. And then more importantly, as that -- as the direction of those books reverses and Medicaid shrinks in 2023 from redetermination. Does that create a headwind? And what levers are you pulling to offset that headwind for SG&A ratio? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the question, Dave. As you can imagine, there's a lot of puts and takes associated with SG&A ratios and by the ability to invest and the fact that we have been investing quite heavily in various digital capabilities, things that are member facing and can actually improve the member experience. The other aspect is that, we've really enjoyed a lot of fixed cost leveraging. Our premiums grew at 13.5% year-over-year, which obviously allowed the SG&A ratio to decline from that aspect as well. So, we do expect a reduction in our operating expense ratio in 2023, driven by the leverage of top line growth, as well as improved operating efficiency, partially offset by the reinvestment and strategic initiatives in support of our growth. So, while certainly, the mix of business does matter. And as we said in the guidance, Carelon services carries a higher SG&A ratio than the rest of the company in general. And we expect Carelon Services to grow faster, a lot of puts and takes. But fixed cost leveraging and investment in capabilities are probably two of the most significant drivers year-over-year. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please, go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Yes. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate the color on the 2023 membership guidance, particularly in the -- your commercial segment with the repricing strategy. You may have touched on this a little bit, but I guess, you previously talked about your goal of narrowing the profitability gap between the fee-based and risk-based commercial customers. I'm just curious, if you can just provide a little more color on your expected progress on that profit gap in calendar 2023 in particular, just in light of all the pricing and growth trends you talked about for the risk and fee-based books of business in commercial.\nGail Boudreaux: Great. I'll have Morgan share his thoughts.\nMorgan Kendrick: Steven, thank you for the question. And we had a very successful selling season with CarelonRx, as Pete indicated, and we grew our specialty lines of business rather materially, and we continue to make steady progress towards our goal of improving that revenue gap between risk and fee-based business. One thing of note, when you think about in 2022, retrospectively looking back, which will take -- carry us forward as well, admin fee revenue grew nearly 8% compared with 4% in our fee-based membership growth. So this alone is certainly clearly indicating that we've got an expansion in revenue and product per sold member. I would say, this is driven by not only our Carelon assets, but it's also driven by strong growth in our clinical buy-ups. Again, noted specialty products and our aligned incentives Carelon services products. And, again -- so we feel good about that trajectory. We feel good about that gap continuing to close. And as John had indicated earlier, this isn't about any one segment. This is around actually growing that fee-based business. Many -- much of that business is moving to the fee-based schedules, but also the pull-through of the Carelon asset that we're working jointly with Pete and his team on. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, as Morgan just shared, we're making really nice progress on really improving the -- both the revenue per member and the profitability per member in our fee-based business. And the example he gave, I think, helps demonstrate that. And so overall, we feel it's been strong and we have a lot of confidence in that. So thanks again for the question. And it's, again, part of optimizing our health benefits business that we've talked about. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I ask, kind of, a question on the future state of the CarelonRx business, because you guys announced the BioPlus acquisition, you've got the synergy initiatives. You've got the JV with SS&C on DomaniRx. So I guess it's probably a question for 2024 or beyond. But I guess can you talk about how much of the vertical integration of the PBM business that you think that you need to do, given the outsourced relationship with CVS and the other initiatives that you have going on? Thank you.\nPeter Haytaian : Yes, George. Thanks a lot for that question. And I think it's helpful to sort of step back and think about our overall strategy and where we started in this regard. When we started a few years ago, we always talked about being a different kind of PBM and our strategy has been keenly focused on whole health and integration of medical, pharmacy, behavioral and social. And that's been core to what we've been doing. And we've also said, and we've been very deliberate about this, that we want to own the strategic levers that matter. Those that, quite frankly, drive the greatest affordability choice, and of course superior patient experience. And that's the journey we're going on. I think what you're seeing in BioPlus and what you're seeing in synergy are really good examples of that and what we prioritized. If you look at specialty pharmacy, it's 40% to 50% of the overall drug spend right now. And it's a critical driver of value for patients. And so that's where we started. And we'll continue on this journey, again, through the lens of greater affordability and superior patient experience. So over time, you will continue to see us take ownership of the strategic levers that really matter.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor : Hi. Good morning. Actually I had a quick question about BioPlus as well. I was just wondering a couple of things. If you could give us a sense of annual revenue there, geographic reach and someone I think Pete earlier said in the future would bring specialty fulfillment in-house. And I thought that's what BioPlus was. So I just want to make sure I understand the business model there?\nPeter Haytaian : Yes. Thanks for the question, Gary. We feel really good about adding BioPlus to the family. It hasn't obviously closed yet. We think it will likely close in the first quarter. And in terms of their breath, I won't get into all the specifics about it, but they are the largest independent specialty pharmacy out there that remains with a broad range of services. They cover over 100 of the limited distribution drugs. So we feel really good about that. And their footprint is covering all 50 states. So we believe it's a really great platform. The other thing I would say that we're really impressed by two things, quite frankly. One is really great talent over there with a lot of experience, long-standing experience. And then the other real differentiating factor around BioPlus is their differentiated service model. Time to therapy, the speed to which they're providing services is really differentiating and we'd like to build upon that. So we're excited about this. And when it closes, we're obviously going to be very focused on building the scale to be able to take on all our specialty pharmacy.\nGail Boudreaux : Thank you. We have one last question.\nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Michael Ha from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ha : Hey, thank you for the question. Just wanted to dig a little deeper on commercial margins. I know you mentioned you're still targeting 10.5% to 11.5% by 2025 I think John might have mentioned 125 bps better commercial margin in 2023. Was that right? And if so, that would be slightly more than 8% for 2023, which means there's still a considerable gap to your 2025 target. And I was expecting a majority of that improvement might happen this year just given your repricing experts, but if you're seeing 125 bps in 2023 and the following two years, would need at least 225 bps of improvement. So I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the path and progression of that improvement in 2024 and 2025. If you could help us break down the drivers we can better envision that path? Like what percent of that improvement is coming from up-selling your fee based business or the shift to higher margin small group or just any other contributors, maybe potentially more of a pricing efforts beyond 2023? Yeah, thank you.\nJohn Gallinan: Yeah. Thank you for the question, Michael. I'm not sure where your 125 basis point comment came from. But that was not part of our prepared remarks. What I can share is that if you look at the press release and you can see on a reported basis, the third quarter of 2022 versus the third quarter of 2021, commercial margins increased by 120 basis points. And then in the fourth quarter of 2022 versus fourth quarter of 2021 on that reported basis, the commercial margins increased by 180 basis points. In terms of the margin improvement, as we have said historically, it is not going to be pro rata. If we've got three more years, 2023 through 2025 to get to those target margins that it will -- there will be far more of the improvement here in 2023 for the reason that you noted. And then there will be continued improvement in 2024 and 2025. Obviously, we're going to continue to optimize our fully insured block together with the fee based selling strategies that Morgan talked about, overall, we're still standing behind that margin target through 2025. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, John, and thank you for everyone for joining us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2022 and are confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us well for 2023. We look forward to discussing our long-term strategy in greater detail at our 2023 Investor Conference, which we said we plan to host in New York City on March 23, 2023.

            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "Yes. No, thanks a lot Gail. Thanks a lot, Lance, for the question. Overall, as Gail said, we're really pleased with the momentum and performance that we saw in 2022. And as Gail noted, in the year, we did do a lot around restructuring. We obviously went through rebranding, which there was a lot of excitement around. And as she said, we infused a lot of new talent across the organization. And then, in terms of the infrastructure we built internally, we're very focused. As you know, a core part of our strategy is focused on internal growth and serving Elevance affiliated health plans. And so we built the infrastructure to engage, to a much better degree, with our associates and partners internally. And we're seeing really good progress there. I hope you can see that through the numbers and the improvement in the year. We remain keenly focused on whole health and improving the patient experience. That's something else that we're very focused on looking from the outside in, in terms of the patient experience. And I'd say the other thing that we've been really focused on internally, and we're trying to change the culture, and its working, is driving more risk and capitation through the portfolio. And that has really helped in terms of the acceleration of our growth and the innovation that we're seeing going forward. As it relates to your question on some of the care delivery partnerships. We're seeing really good progress there. Again, when you look at the assets within Carelon, it can add a lot of value to our partners. And so, we continue to look to wrap around those services and create incremental value. And as we look forward, we have that in mind as well. When we talk to our provider base partners, where are they feeling stressed, where can we support them. So there's a lot of opportunity that we got going forward. Yes. No, thanks for the question, Nathan. As it relates to 2023, just to be clear, and John noted this in the prepared remarks, the low double-digit range growth in 2023 is really organic growth. It does not include M&A. I think if you look at our recent history, there's been a lot of M&A that's contributed meaningfully to us. And we're being very intentional about that. We're very focused on it. It's something that we'll continue to do. And I think it's an important part of our growth strategy going forward. As Gail said, in terms of the amount of medical spend that we penetrate, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but we're really encouraged with our trajectory right now. We feel like we can continue to grow pretty significantly. There's a lot of white space internally. So a lot of opportunity there. But to your point about external growth, we did establish some new leadership. We've got a new infrastructure in terms of external growth. We're very focused, as Gail said, you've heard a lot about the Blues and Blue partnerships, and we're very encouraged of what we're seeing in terms of the Blue opportunity. So we do think we can see nice growth externally as well. But again, our first focus is on the affiliated health plans and creating value there first. Yes. Thanks. In terms of the short-term, if you're referencing the script growth, overall, we're going to see nice script growth in Medicare and commercial. In terms of the headwind to that, really, that's due to the Medicaid dynamic around reverifications, or redeterminations. And then overall, we're going to see lower COVID vaccination. So that doesn't impact operating gain, but that is really the reason for the difference in the numbers in terms of what you're seeing short-term, long-term. In terms of overall growth, though, we feel really good about how we're doing in the pharmacy business. There continues to be a lot of interest in our integrated value proposition. In 2022, we're coming off a good year. We saw a 300% improvement in net membership growth. So that was good in terms of penetrating our self-funded business. And we're seeing that continue to play through into 2023. We're obviously through a lot of the selling for the beginning of the year, what we did see is we saw a lot more activity and penetration in the 10,000 or less business. We saw RFPs up by about 6% year-over-year. And again, I'll reiterate, but this is a segment an area that we perform really, really well in. I think you referenced a synergy at the end of your question. And again, to Gail's point in our commentary, our focus, a big part of our strategy is overall affordability and choice and this creates an opportunity for us in the context of medical specialty to create more affordability for our members. Again, by working in conjunction with the Blues across 100 million Americans, those that are utilizing specialty on the medical side, we have an opportunity to create much greater affordability. So we look forward to that. That work is in earnest right now in 2023 with value potentially playing through into 2024. Yes, George. Thanks a lot for that question. And I think it's helpful to sort of step back and think about our overall strategy and where we started in this regard. When we started a few years ago, we always talked about being a different kind of PBM and our strategy has been keenly focused on whole health and integration of medical, pharmacy, behavioral and social. And that's been core to what we've been doing. And we've also said, and we've been very deliberate about this, that we want to own the strategic levers that matter. Those that, quite frankly, drive the greatest affordability choice, and of course superior patient experience. And that's the journey we're going on. I think what you're seeing in BioPlus and what you're seeing in synergy are really good examples of that and what we prioritized. If you look at specialty pharmacy, it's 40% to 50% of the overall drug spend right now. And it's a critical driver of value for patients. And so that's where we started. And we'll continue on this journey, again, through the lens of greater affordability and superior patient experience. So over time, you will continue to see us take ownership of the strategic levers that really matter. Yes. Thanks for the question, Gary. We feel really good about adding BioPlus to the family. It hasn't obviously closed yet. We think it will likely close in the first quarter. And in terms of their breath, I won't get into all the specifics about it, but they are the largest independent specialty pharmacy out there that remains with a broad range of services. They cover over 100 of the limited distribution drugs. So we feel really good about that. And their footprint is covering all 50 states. So we believe it's a really great platform. The other thing I would say that we're really impressed by two things, quite frankly. One is really great talent over there with a lot of experience, long-standing experience. And then the other real differentiating factor around BioPlus is their differentiated service model. Time to therapy, the speed to which they're providing services is really differentiating and we'd like to build upon that. So we're excited about this. And when it closes, we're obviously going to be very focused on building the scale to be able to take on all our specialty pharmacy."

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered strong fourth quarter results, closing out another year of growth, consistent with our long-term targets and considerable progress in our transformation to become a lifetime trusted health partner. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP earnings per share of $3.93, and adjusted earnings per share of $5.23. For the full year, we reported GAAP earnings per share of $24.81 and adjusted earnings per share of $29.7 and reflecting growth of 15% year-over-year from our adjusted baseline of $25.20 in 2022. 2022 marks the fifth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate. This reflects the focused and sustained execution of our strategy to optimize our health benefits businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities, and accelerate capabilities and services. Elevance Health ended 2022, serving more than 47.5 million medical members, up nearly 2.2 million members year-over-year, including more than 1 million new commercial and over 1 million new government members, investments in enhancing the customer experience, delivering innovative, customized whole health solutions, deepening digital engagement, and prioritizing health equity, all helped to deliver strong growth across customer segments. Membership growth, coupled with expansion in both the scope and scale of Caroline's business with our health plans, helped to propel double-digit growth in CarelonRx and Carelon services. In total, for the year, Elevance Health produced nearly 14% growth in operating revenue and double-digit growth in adjusted operating earnings. Now, I'd like to discuss a number of recent developments, including the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana that we just announced on Monday. Like our Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield family of plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana is deeply rooted in its local community, serving Louisiana for almost 90 years. And like our health plans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana is committed to improving the health and lives of the people of Louisiana. Our organizations are well aligned in our mission and purpose. And have worked together in partnership through our Healthy Blue Alliance, serving Medicaid and dual special needs plans in Louisiana for a number of years now. Upon closing, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana will be our 15th Blue state, providing us with deep local roots in a new market, while we bring national scale and access to our portfolio of innovative solutions and capabilities to support the community. We're looking forward to accelerating Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana strategy to make an even greater difference in the health and lives of the 1.9 million individuals they serve. Blue Cross some Blue Shield plans are at our best when we collaborate. Together, the Blue system provides health benefits to nearly 15 million consumers across all 50 states. There are many untapped opportunities to leverage our unique scale. One recent example is Synergy Medication Collective. Earlier this year, we became a founding investor in this new contracting organization founded by a group of Blue Cross and Blue Shield affiliated companies. The collective focuses on improving affordability and access to medical specialty drugs that are injected or infused in a clinical setting. Synergy will seek best-in-class medical drug pricing, leveraging our collective industry-leading specialty drug spend to enhance affordability, and drive toward value-based care representing another example of Blue's partnering for progress. Inside Elevance Health, we are also directly addressing fast-growing areas of cost trend. In November, we announced the acquisition of BioPlus, the largest independent specialty pharmacy provider offering a complete range of specialty pharmacy services for patients living with complex and chronic conditions. BioPlus will enhance our ability to deliver on our whole health promise and enable us to leverage our resources and scale to deliver greater affordability and access to critical medications. Over time, it will allow us to bring specialty pharmacy fulfillment for our members in-house, at what is a dynamic time in this field, given the anticipated growth of biosimilars. Upon closing, BioPlus will become part of CarelonRx, our pharmacy services business that we rebranded at the beginning of this year, with the addition of specialty pharmacy, we will expand the scope of the services and capabilities inside of Carelon and by extension, the proportion of overall healthcare spending that we manage or address. The acquisition of BioPlus furthers our commitment to scaling healthcare services to address the needs of health plans beginning with our own. Of Carelon's nearly $41 billion of revenue in 2022, approximately 60% came from partnering with our health plans. Meanwhile, in 2022, Carelon achieved the goal we set at our March 2021 Investor Conference of managing at least 20% of our consolidated benefit expense by 2025. This is three years ahead of schedule, a testament to the growing suite of capabilities within Carelon. Carelon has made significant progress since our last investor conference. And we look forward to providing shareholders an update on our long-range planning at our next investor conference, which will be held on Thursday, March 23, 2023 in New York City. Increasingly, we are evaluating and growing our enterprise through two primary businesses; health benefits and healthcare services. And we're continuing down the path of scaling Carelon by addressing the needs of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health benefits businesses. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we will evolve our external reporting to better align with this approach and begin to report Carelon split between Carelon Rx and Carelon Services, while we combine our commercial and government health benefits operations for reporting purposes into a single health benefit segment. Our new reporting structure will allow stakeholders to more clearly track the progress we are making against our enterprise strategy and better reflect how we evaluate our business results against our enterprise strategy today. John will discuss this more in his remarks, and you can also find a pro forma view of quarterly and full year 2022 results, the new reporting structure at a supplemental table in this morning's press release. Now, I'd like to touch on a few recent highlights before discussing our outlook for 2023. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to become the first managed care organization in the nation to earn the full three-year health equity accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance for all of our own Medicaid health plans, covering nearly 90% of our Medicaid membership. This recognition demonstrates that focus and resolve yield results. We have long been dedicated to countering health and equities across our enterprise and through partnerships with care providers. We continue to work toward health equity through policy and practice in pursuit of better outcomes and experiences for all, and ultimately to improve the health of humanity. Our Medicaid team is prepared to uphold that commitment by ensuring access to care for underprivileged populations through continuity of coverage for all beneficiaries eligible for Medicaid, who will be subject to the eligibility redeterminations this year. We look forward to working alongside state partners to help minimize loss of coverage due to administrative challenges and to ensure beneficiaries no longer eligible for Medicaid understand their coverage options. Our ACA exchange plans are now being offered in almost every county in our 14 Blue states. We remain committed and prepared to ensure seamless transitions of those Medicaid members, as they move into exchange plans or employer-based coverage. Across our health plans, we are optimizing our businesses. The pandemic brought with it substantial uncertainties and that resulted in margin compression in our commercial and Medicare health plans in 2021 that we didn't recover in 2022. It has since become apparent that COVID costs are not going to zero. And as we discussed last year, we've been repricing our risk in our commercial business, and we are enjoying improved reimbursement rates risk adjustment revenue and star quality bonus payments in our Medicare Advantage business in 2023. With January 1 renewals behind us in commercial, and the 2023 Medicare Advantage plan year underway, we remain confident in the margin recovery previously discussed and for the improvement in our commercial and Medicare businesses to more than offset anticipated member attrition in our Medicaid business when redeterminations begin on April 1st. Our confidence in operating our Medicare Advantage business solidly inside our long-term 3% to 5% target margin range has been underpinned by our bid strategy, in which we took a balanced approach. While the AEP proved to be somewhat more competitive than we expected, we still expect to grow Medicare Advantage membership relatively close to our prior targeted growth rate in 2023. Turning now to our outlook for 2023. We expect adjusted earnings of greater than $32.60 per share, reflecting growth of over 12%. Our guidance reflects double-digit growth in operating earnings in each of our health benefits and Carelon businesses that will be driven by the focused execution of our enterprise strategy, to optimize our health benefits business, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate capabilities and services. Our outlook contemplates a range of outcomes on Medicaid redeterminations coverage shifts and retention and our expectation for commercial and Medicare margin recovery from pandemic aero loans. John will discuss our assumptions in greater detail. The strong growth we achieved in 2022 would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our more than 100,000 associates. Our collective determination to improve lives and communities is unwavering, and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. I would like to thank them for the important work they do and the impact they make every day. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? Well, thanks for the question, Lance. Let me frame a little bit of what you asked, and then I'll ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to give you a little bit more color on that. First, in terms of org structure, we've actually been building our team over the last 18 months, and Pete's done a really strong job of both, bringing individuals who are in the services industry to Carelon, but also taking individuals from our health benefits business, who have a deep understanding of that business and having them lead. So we feel we've got a really good mix of talent and have been building our bench strength pretty effectively. So we don't envision any structural changes, obviously, as acquisitions come in, they fit into the verticals that we've shared as part of our strategy. So let me just have Pete comment a little bit about -- a little bit more about Carelon and our growth there. Yes. Thanks, Pete. And Lance, specifically, in terms of how we're deploying, we see those partnerships and some of the investments we've made as part of our overall value-based care strategy. Our penetration has been strong, we're around 63% driven by purposeful collaboration. Those are two really good examples. We continue to learn and improve that approach, and part of that is how we work closely with Carelon to capitate services and actually, I think, impact more of the health care dollar and impact more of overall services. But we feel really confident about the strategy that we've deployed. And as I've shared before on these calls, we know that sharing -- the downside risk is really the most important part of where we need to achieve better outcomes. And so we're continuing to grow those arrangements, Early days still, but we feel good about the partnerships that we have, and we continue to expand them, and we feel on track to deliver on the goals that we've shared previously at our Investor Day, but also in these calls. So thanks very much for the question and next question please. Well, thank you, A.J. That was a very comprehensive set of questions, and let me try to kind of go through them. First, we really are excited about the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield Louisiana. As you said, it's been some time since one of these has occurred. But I think as you think about like the driver for this, this is very much a strategic acquisition. The Board of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, really wanted to have a greater impact and accelerate the strategy that they put in place. This is a solidly run plan, 4.5-star Medicare plan. And I think those are really important things as you think about this acquisition. The other thing that I think is really important for us is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana very much aligns with our strategy. They're deeply rooted in their local communities. They -- as we shared, they've served Louisiana for more than 90 years. Our mission and purpose is well aligned. And we've had a healthy Blue Alliance partnership with them that serves our Medicaid and dual special needs plans for a number of years now. So we've worked together culturally, I think there's a great alignment there. And the other thing is we're excited because this brings the 15th Blue state. So we can -- just as we have in our other 14, we've kept our deep local roots in a new market, but we also can bring our national scale and access to our portfolio of innovative solutions and capabilities, again, accelerating what the Blue Cross Blue Shield strategic focus has been, and that supports the community. And I think accelerates their strategy and making an even greater difference in impact on the 1.9 million lives. In terms of closing, this will be subject to the normal closing conditions. And as we shared, we believe that we expect the deal to close in the second half of 2023. So again, not much more there. We do feel the impact that we can have on the community and the citizen in Louisiana with the foundation, accelerate Louisiana really is a strong component of this and helps accelerate health care status, accessibility, affordability as well as health equity, and those are areas that we've been deeply investing and committed to as well. In terms of collaborations, you heard that we've done a number of collaborations and feel good about the Synergy Medical Collective, which is a great example of all of us coming together around medical specialty and again, with an alignment and focus around fundamentally improving affordability. We have 150 million Americans that we serve across this country. And we feel that ability for us to work together to have an even greater impact, again, on access and affordability is really important. And I would just point to that as an example. So, thank you very much for the question. I think we, again, are excited about this. We think it's a great collaboration for us and feel that there's an opportunity for us to work together and for us to obviously use Carelon to help support the advancement of all Blues. So thanks very much. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question, please. Yes. Thanks, Nathan. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian provide a little perspective. And as we shared earlier, we are going to be updating our long-term planning at our Investor Day in March. So we probably won't go into like where we think our updated guidance is on that, but we can certainly give you some color on how each of the components are playing and feel very good about the progress that Carelon overall is making. So Pete? Thank you. Next question, please. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood to comment on Minnesota. Yes. Thanks, Felicia. And Scott, that will be in January 24, just from a timing perspective. Next question, please. Next question, please. Yes, thanks, John. And Kevin, I think it's an insightful question because as you've heard us talk about, I think there's three core pillars of how we see our business evolving. Optimizing our health benefits business. It's highly scaled. We're very diversified in that business. And again, as you think about 2023, we have an opportunity for margin recovery, which is really we've been intensely focused on. But the other two pillars, I think, are really important about our future growth, which is investing in growth opportunities. And then third, accelerating services and capabilities, particularly through Carelon. And remember, as we think about Carelon, a lot of that is synergistic with our health plan business. We've continued to grow this and that allows the synergy to also occur with Carelon services as well as expanding capabilities that you've seen us, but through organically and inorganically. So overall, I think we've got more levers than we've ever had historically, and those positioned us well for the balance that John just shared. Next question, please. Sure, I'll have Felicia Norwood, who leads that business, to share her comments. Thank you. Next question, please. Well, thanks for the question, Josh. In terms of -- a little bit consistent, I guess, with what I shared before on value-based care, I mean, we've been -- we continue, quite frankly, to refine and improve our strategy. We feel we're making really good progress on it. What we're seeing is a lot more interest in sharing up and downside risk. Historically, value-based care was more upside risk and we've gotten about 63%. We've gone -- we've continued to refine that to now include much more downside risk. And also, I think one of the biggest differences is the sharing of data bilaterally and much more timely. So that action can be taken in -- I think, in a much more integrated way. And we're doing a lot of work with that with our care providers. It's embedded. And also, what happens, like, post primary care. So how do we manage all the specialty services? That's a big part of the Carelon strategy in terms of what Pete is doing in his business. So as I think about that, I would say, structurally, we're seeing a lot more interest and a lot more conversation as this takes several years for, I think, physician practices to get comfortable with value-based care. And so, we're building credibility with that. We're getting better at our reporting and our engagement. And we're not only doing it across Medicare Advantage, and I think that is one of the changes. Some of our relationships are specific to commercial, for example, and that's a very different approach, including with some fee-based customers. So that would be a trend. In terms of the ownership of physicians, I think, we've been very consistent about that. We do own physicians in terms of our integrated health plans, and those have performed very well in MMM and health fund in Florida. I think, CareMore is beginning to become even more integrated with the work we're doing. So I think our strategy has stayed very consistent there. So I don't really have any significant updates, other than I think it's all embedded and our ability to drive more downside risk integrate data in a much more real-time basis. And then, really become true partners and train each other and how do we work in a value-based care environment. As, I think, you know well, this doesn't happen overnight, and it takes quite a bit of work for us on both sides to be committed to the long-term partnership, but we feel good, and we're seeing more enrollment in those partnerships. And the results have been good. We see differentiated quality and cost outcomes. So thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian to address that, please. Thank you. Next question, please. Sure, Whit. I'm going to have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our commercial business, give you some perspective there. Thank you. Next question, please. Next question, please. Great. I'll have Morgan share his thoughts. Yes. Thanks for the question. I think, as Morgan just shared, we're making really nice progress on really improving the -- both the revenue per member and the profitability per member in our fee-based business. And the example he gave, I think, helps demonstrate that. And so overall, we feel it's been strong and we have a lot of confidence in that. So thanks again for the question. And it's, again, part of optimizing our health benefits business that we've talked about. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question. Thank you. We have one last question. Thank you, John, and thank you for everyone for joining us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2022 and are confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us well for 2023. We look forward to discussing our long-term strategy in greater detail at our 2023 Investor Conference, which we said we plan to host in New York City on March 23, 2023. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of week. Thank you."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "Yes. Good morning, Scott, and thank you for the question on Minnesota. We operate over 27 Medicaid plans across the country with over 11.5 million members. And when you think about what we do, we bring very deep expertise in this business and a relentless focus on our whole health strategy, health equity and improving health outcomes. The expertise we bring to the table has been recognized by our external partners, and we really look forward to continuing to bring that experience to other Blue partners and alliances, not only in Medicaid, but in Medicare as well. When I think about our alliance relationships, each of them is very different. And Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota decided to end our administrative services relationship, which supported about 330,000 Medicaid members and provide back-office services in-house. We're going to work with them to make sure that there's a seamless transition, because at the core of what we do, we want to make sure our members are taking care of, and that's our highest priority. So we continue to value alliance relationships and really look forward to continued growth in this segment, with partners who value the deep expertise that we bring to the table for serving vulnerable and complex populations. Thank you. So, good morning and thank you for that question. When we think about Medicare Advantage, as Gail mentioned in her early remarks, we took a very strategic approach as we thought about our bids for 2023, and we expect to deliver good performance in terms of growth, not just in individual, but also in group. As John referenced, we plan to grow between 75,000 and 125,000. But we did end up encountering a very competitive. On the other hand, we had very solid growth in our D-SNP business, which is where we've had a focus for some period of time. And I think that positions us well for the rest of OEP in the remainder of 2023. As we think about our competitiveness, we have a very strong benefit portfolio, and we believe that we're positioned well in order to continue to grow this business. So at the end of the day, a competitive environment, which it always will be in Medicare Advantage, but still an opportunity to grow in a business that we feel very good about. And most importantly, the opportunity is we are in 2023 to deliver very strong margin recovery and operate squarely within our 3% to 5% pre-tax target margin range in this business, so solid growth and solid margins in 2023."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. We are pleased to have delivered solid fourth quarter financial results, closing out another strong year of growth for Elevance Health. The focused execution on our enterprise strategy continues to drive progress against our stated long-term targets. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.23 was ahead of our expectations and drove full-year adjusted earnings per share to $29.7, reflecting growth of over 15% year-over-year off of our adjusted 2021 baseline of $25.20 and above our long-term 12% to 15% annual earnings per share growth target. We ended the year with 47.5 million members, up $2.2 million or nearly 5% year-over-year, with organic growth having comprised more than 85% of our overall increase. In the fourth quarter, medical membership grew by 248,000 members, led by growth in Medicaid, driven in large part by the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and the acquisition of Vivida Health, which added 29,000 Medicaid members. For the full year, we added 1.1 million net new commercial members and 1.1 million net new government members. Total operating revenue for the year was nearly $156 billion, an increase of approximately 14% over the prior year, reflecting solid growth in our health benefits businesses and continued momentum in Carelon. We are pleased with the progress made to accelerate our service capabilities during the year as Carelon Rx and Carelon services grew revenue by 12% and 27% over 2021, respectively. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 89.4%, a decrease of 10 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2021. This strong performance includes an improvement in commercial underwriting margin and also benefited from the reclassification of certain quality improvement expenses. These improvements were partially offset by the Medicaid business, which carries a higher benefit expense ratio than our commercial and Medicare health plans. Elevance Health's SG&A expense ratio in the fourth quarter was 11.5% and 11.4% for the full year reflecting an improvement of 20 basis points in the fourth quarter and full year. These positive results include the negative impact on the SG&A ratio related to aligning certain quality improvement expenses with CMS guidelines. The overall improvement was driven primarily by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue. In 2022, we produced another year of strong operating cash flow of $8.4 billion, representing 1.4 times net income, which was significantly better than our outlook to start the year and was driven by stronger risk-based membership growth and maintaining a prudent balance sheet. Additionally, relative to our initial guidance, a shift in the timing of certain payments to state-based partners added over $500 million to the fourth quarter operating cash flow that we now expect that we will pay in the first quarter of 2023. We ended 2022 with a debt-to-cap ratio of 39.9%, in line with our expectations and within our targeted range. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our stock for $567 million. For the year, we repurchased 4.8 million shares for $2.3 billion, exceeding our initial outlook for 2022, as we took advantage of the volatile periods in the market and opportunistically repurchase shares. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable ended the year at 47.7 days, an increase of 2.5 days year-over-year, and stable with the third quarter. Medical claims payable grew over 15% year-over-year compared to premium revenue growth of 13.5%. In summary, 2022 was a very strong year. We grew adjusted earnings per share by over 15%. We grew operating gain by nearly 13%. We grew membership by 2.2 million, and we grew revenue by nearly 14%, all with a stable medical loss ratio, a 2.5-day increase in days in claims payable and operating cash flow of $8.4 billion or 1.4 times net income. Before turning to our 2023 outlook, I would like to provide more detail on our decision to adapt our external segment reporting to better align with our enterprise strategy. Beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we will begin to disclose Carelon as a separate business division and provide operating revenue, operating gain and operating margin information separately for Carelon Services and Carelon Rx. Carelon offers a diverse suite of services across behavioral health, advanced analytics and services, complex care, pharmacy services and digital assets, and we remain committed to expanding the scale and scope of services Carelon provides to our own and third-party health plans. As we've continued down the path of scaling Carelon by addressing the needs of our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health benefits businesses, it's become increasingly apparent that the similarities between our health plans have evolved to outnumber the differences. And we have also decided to combine our employer, individual, Medicare, Medicaid health plans and products into a single health benefits division. The remaining segment, Corporate and Other will include a small amount of revenue and earnings from non-Carelon, non-health benefits businesses, as well as our corporate unallocated expenses. The new health benefits segment will combine the same group of businesses that currently comprises the commercial and specialty and government business divisions. In the Carelon Services segment, reflects the same group of businesses that comprised the diversified business group, now Carelon services, which has historically been included as part of our old other segment. We are excited to begin disclosing the performance of our two primary and distinct businesses in a manner more consistent with how we will grow our enterprise for years to come and to be doing so at the time of strength for our organization. As you can see, our commercial health plan margin recovery is well underway and will extend into 2023, which is reflected in our Health Benefits segment margin guidance provided in our press release this morning. To ensure a smooth transition to our new reporting structure, we have also included a supplemental table in this morning's press release, showing our quarterly and full year 2022 results pro forma for new reporting structure alongside new supplemental performance metrics for CarelonRx and Carelon services that can be used to model revenue for each business. Our commitment to elevating whole health and advancing health beyond health care is unwavering, and our new segment reporting structure will allow our stakeholders to more clearly track the progress we're making against our enterprise strategy. Now, I'd like to discuss our outlook for 2023 in greater detail. We are pleased to have provided initial earnings per share guidance of greater than $32.60, reflecting growth of over 12% year-over-year, putting us on track to produce a sixth consecutive year of growth in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our long-term 12% to 15% compound annual growth rate target. 2023 will be a year of optimization, but we will also demonstrate the balance and resilience of our health benefits businesses as we execute the planned recovery of our commercial and Medicare health plan margins from pandemic era low's, which we expect will more than offset the impact of membership attrition and margin normalization in our Medicaid business when eligibility redeterminations resume. For 2023, we anticipate growth in medical membership despite commercial repricing and Medicaid redeterminations. Commercial risk-based membership is expected in 2023, up over 200,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 4.9 million to 5.1 million members. Growth will be driven by individual and small group risk-based membership, partially offset by attrition in our large group risk business, driven by the repricing discussed earlier. Note that we expect commercial risk-based membership to decline by approximately 60,000 in the first quarter, with individual up approximately 100,000 and group risk-based membership down approximately 160,000. We anticipate growth in individual and group risk-based membership over the balance of the year, concentrated in the second half, as consumers transition from Medicaid to commercial coverage. Fee-based membership is expected to grow by approximately 600,000 members at the midpoint to 27.1 million to 27.4 million at year-end 2023. The wider-than-normal range contemplates a variety of scenarios related to coverage shifts out of Medicaid, and into employer-sponsored plans and the relatively uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We expect approximately one-third of this growth to occur in the first quarter with the balance more heavily concentrated in the back half of the year as consumer's transition from Medicaid to commercial coverage. Total commercial membership will end the year in the range of 32 million to 32.5 million members, up over 800,000 members at the midpoint. Medicare Advantage membership is expected to grow by approximately 75,000 to 125,000 members, with growth in both individual and group pushing our membership over the 2 million member mark. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 10.8 million to 11.3 million, driven by the attrition associated with eligibility redeterminations beginning on April 1 of this year. This wider-than-normal range contemplates a range of scenarios on the pace of redeterminations and the prospect of macroeconomic headwinds developing over the course of 2023. And finally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits memberships will be relatively stable year-over-year. In total, medical membership is expected to end 2023 in the range of 47.4 million to 48.5 million, reflecting growth of over 400,000 members at the midpoint. The consolidated medical loss ratio is expected to be 87.2% in 2023, plus or minus 50 basis points, an improvement of approximately 20 basis points compared with 2022, primarily driven by the re-pricing of commercial risk-based business and margin expansion in Medicare Advantage, related to the improved reimbursement levels across rates, risk adjustment and star quality performance. The SG&A expense ratio is expected to be 11.2%, plus or minus 50 basis points, a reduction of 20 basis points at the midpoint driven by expense leverage associated with growth in operating revenue, partially offset by continued growth in our Carelon businesses, which carry higher SG&A ratio than our health benefits business. We expect operating gain for the year to be greater than $9.35 billion, reflecting growth of at least 10% over 2022, again, being the primary driver of growth in adjusted earnings per share. Below the line, we expect investment income to be approximately $1.6 billion and interest expense to be approximately $1 billion, both reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. And our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 22% to 24%. Our full year operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $7.6 billion, including the unfavorable impact of a timing delay on the payment of approximately $500 million to certain Medicaid state partners that we previously believed we would pay in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusting for timing, our 2023 cash flow outlook will be greater than $8.1 billion or approximately 1.1 times our expected GAAP net income. We expect full year share repurchases of approximately $2 billion, and our weighted average fully diluted share count for the year is expected to be in the range of 239 million to 240 million shares outstanding. Our 2023 guidance does not include the pending acquisition of BioPlus or Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, which we expect will close later in the year. Importantly, neither is expected to have a material impact on earnings in 2023. At the segment level, we expect the Health Benefit segment operating revenue to grow in the mid to upper single-digit percentage range year-over-year in 2023, with segment operating margin up 25 to 50 basis points year-over-year. We expect CarelonRx revenue to grow in the upper single-digit percentage range with low single-digit growth in adjusted scripts and mid single-digit growth in revenue per adjusted script. And we expect Carelon Services to grow revenue in the low double-digit range organically, excluding all pending or unannounced M&A, driven by growth in revenue per consumer served, as we expect consumer serve to grow in the low single-digit range from 105 million at year-end 2022. Carelon Services operating margin is expected to expand by 25 to 50 basis points year-over-year in 2023. With respect to earnings seasonality, we are projecting similar profitability patterns to historical ranges and expect to earn slightly more than 55% of our full year adjusted earnings per share in the first half of the year with slightly more than half of that in the first quarter, consistent with current consensus modeling of seasonality. Finally, we remain committed to enhancing shareholder returns through capital deployment, including share repurchases and dividends and are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors recently approved a 16% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $1.48 per share, our 12th consecutive annual increase, which will be paid on March 24 and to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10. In closing, 2022 was another year of strong growth for Elevance Health as we continue down the path of transforming from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime, trusted health partner, and we are well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth in line with our long-term targets in 2023. We look forward to discussing our enterprise strategy and long-term financial targets at our upcoming investor conference, which we will host in New York City on Thursday, March 23, 2023. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Thank you, Justin. Good morning. And we do appreciate the questions. In terms of commercial, we're actually doing very, very well. We have a repricing effort going on that began on July 1 of 2022. And what we had seen was, the overall cost structure of the commercial market was higher than we had assumed. And so, this repricing was about 25% of the large group block in July. And then we repriced about 50% of the block here on January 1, 2023, and it was really to ensure that the premiums more accurately reflect the underlying cost structure of the book. The result of that would be margin recovery associated with that. We feel very good about the progress that we're making, and we still stand by the commitments that were made in our prior Investor Day to get the commercial margins up to the level that we had estimated by 2025. You have to look at now the health services segment in total. And as you had asked, we have the commercial margin improvement ongoing, we will have Medicare margin improvement, as our risk adjusters are really recovering, risk-adjusted revenue really recovering from pandemic era lows. Also, we do have 74% of our MA membership in 4-star plans or above for the 2023 payment year. And we believe our Medicare Advantage business will be solidly within the target margin range of 3% to 5%. And then, on Medicaid, which was your final question, we've been working very closely with our state partners on Medicaid and feel very good about the rating actions. And that the rates are actuarially sound rates and feel very good about that. However, we were making either at or above the high end of our range here in the last couple of years, which obviously resulted in MLR collars and various other rebates being paid back to the states. We expect that the Medicaid business will be solidly within the 2% to 4% range, closer to the high end, but still with actuarial equivalent rates. So hopefully, that helps clarify all that. Thank you. Yes, sure. Thank you, Scott, for the question. So associated with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana. As we had stated, we're not expecting that to close until later in [Technical Difficulty] impact on 2023 will not be material, really data line items. However, assuming it does close in 2023 -- in 2024, what we should see is an incremental 1.6 million members after you eliminate the various double counts and you referenced the significant partnership we have with them already. So it's an incremental 1.6 million members. And it's really -- it's an incremental $4.5 billion in revenue on top of what we have now. So that's really about the high-level economics that we would expect to inure in 2024. Thank you for the question Lisa and we're not discussing specific trend assumption for 2023, but really when you look at some of the cost drivers that we have relative to the expectations, emergency room has been favorable, in-patient has been favorable, pharmacy cost actually running a little bit higher than expected. And out-patient is running a little bit higher than expected. I don't know that we really see any pent-up demand as much as we see -- being as much as the new normal. But just to reiterate. The overall cost structure of the business is higher than if COVID had never occurred. COVID is here and it continues to be a cost driver. What I think is probably most important in all of this is that our pricing now reflects the underlying cost structure and our MLR guidance also reflects this higher cost structure. So we actually feel very well positioned going into 2023. Thank you. Yes. Thank you for the question, Kevin. And as you indicated in your question, we're not going to provide any specific details we did on 2024. Obviously, at our Investor Day coming up here in a few months, we'll provide a lot more long-term aspirations. But I think the way you've characterized 2023 is correct. It's really -- it's a year of optimizing our health benefits business, while we continue to grow and expand the capabilities within Carelon. And then you talk about, well, gee, could the headwind be greater? As you look at the Medicaid redeterminations, there's certainly a lot of variables associated with the pace and timing, on a state-by-state basis, where they go, which lines of business, they ultimately reside in I think one of the great things about the balance and resilience of our membership base is that we end up with the members somewhere. We have a product offering for every member regardless of age, regardless of employment status, with regardless of health condition, and feel very, very good. So we do expect approximately about half of the Medicaid members to be reverified here in this calendar year and the other half next year. So there is some balance there. But at the end of the day, we are very well positioned to retain much of that membership. Thank you. Thank you for the question, Dave. As you can imagine, there's a lot of puts and takes associated with SG&A ratios and by the ability to invest and the fact that we have been investing quite heavily in various digital capabilities, things that are member facing and can actually improve the member experience. The other aspect is that, we've really enjoyed a lot of fixed cost leveraging. Our premiums grew at 13.5% year-over-year, which obviously allowed the SG&A ratio to decline from that aspect as well. So, we do expect a reduction in our operating expense ratio in 2023, driven by the leverage of top line growth, as well as improved operating efficiency, partially offset by the reinvestment and strategic initiatives in support of our growth. So, while certainly, the mix of business does matter. And as we said in the guidance, Carelon services carries a higher SG&A ratio than the rest of the company in general. And we expect Carelon Services to grow faster, a lot of puts and takes. But fixed cost leveraging and investment in capabilities are probably two of the most significant drivers year-over-year. Thank you."

            "content": "Hi, there, and Whit, thank you for the question. Regarding the stop-loss business, that's certainly an area that was underperforming priorly and we began that journey to recover the margins in that business back in January of last year. It started with some of our integrated -- our external business rather. And then year progressed further, we had our July cohort, which John mentioned earlier, which was about 25 [ph] to some of our integrated business, both stop loss and risk-based business. Both of those went through a repricing exercise midyear, and then that concluded with January. So regarding the stop-loss market, we feel very good about it. We've got continued strong penetration, but opportunity to continue to grow that, both on our internal integrated business as well as our external. And we feel at this point in time, we have right-priced our business based on risk and we'll continue doing that so very fastidiously as we move through in 2023. Steven, thank you for the question. And we had a very successful selling season with CarelonRx, as Pete indicated, and we grew our specialty lines of business rather materially, and we continue to make steady progress towards our goal of improving that revenue gap between risk and fee-based business. One thing of note, when you think about in 2022, retrospectively looking back, which will take -- carry us forward as well, admin fee revenue grew nearly 8% compared with 4% in our fee-based membership growth. So this alone is certainly clearly indicating that we've got an expansion in revenue and product per sold member. I would say, this is driven by not only our Carelon assets, but it's also driven by strong growth in our clinical buy-ups. Again, noted specialty products and our aligned incentives Carelon services products. And, again -- so we feel good about that trajectory. We feel good about that gap continuing to close. And as John had indicated earlier, this isn't about any one segment. This is around actually growing that fee-based business. Many -- much of that business is moving to the fee-based schedules, but also the pull-through of the Carelon asset that we're working jointly with Pete and his team on. Thank you for the question."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Elevance Health Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's third quarter 2022 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, our President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another strong quarter. This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.68 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.53 ahead of expectations and reflecting strong revenue and earnings growth across our businesses. Based on our year-to-date results and confidence in our momentum, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings guidance to greater than $28.95 per share, representing growth of approximately 15% off of the adjusted baseline we provided at the beginning of the year. Before we discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to spend a moment on the recent hurricanes that have tragically impacted the lives of people in Florida and Puerto Rico, including some of our own health plan members and associates who live and work in the impacted areas. As an organization deeply rooted in our communities, the impact of these disasters is personal. I'd like to thank our associates who are leading efforts to provide water, food, durable medical equipment, transportation and shelter, along with our clinical teams, social workers and behavioral health specialists for their extraordinary commitment to support those in need. It's in time such as these that our culture shines through and I am proud of our associates for the work they are doing to support their colleagues and communities. Turning to our business performance. We are pleased to report ongoing broad-based momentum across Elevance Health, a testament to our integrated and personalized whole health approach to addressing the physical, behavioral and social needs of our members and communities. Our focused efforts and investments in these areas are resonating with employers and state partners driving strong organic membership growth in our commercial and government health benefits businesses, as well as rapid growth for Carelon and IngenioRx. While our business trends remain strong, we are mindful of the inflationary pressure and general uncertainty in the economic environment and are focused on delivering affordability and value for customers and consumers in all of our businesses. Medical membership grew 5% year-over-year to 47.3 million members. Over the past year, we've grown to serve 2.2 million more consumers with both our commercial and government businesses delivering robust growth that solidifies our position as the largest carrier by U.S. based medical membership. In the employer market, we continue to gain market share on the strength of our leading cost of care position and innovative consumer products such as our total health connection suite of advocacy solutions. Total health connections is an example of where we're delivering an integrated whole health experience for consumers by guiding members to the next step in care through a simple, intuitive and personalized experience. Our clinical advocates help members navigate the healthcare system, leveraging real-time data analytics to identify health risks that enable our advocates to personally connect with members and help them proactively manage some medical, behavioral and social issues impacting their health. Health connections has grown more than 60% over the past two years and will support more than 5 million of our members in 2023. In addition to advocacy solutions, our integrated digital offerings are also gaining momentum. Sydney Health, the digital front door for our members' health needs, continues to rapidly expand the number of registered users and is now hosting more than 6 million visits every month. We are also seeing strong member satisfaction with our virtual primary care offering, which is available through Sydney Health and integrated into our commercial products and is increasingly being used to support members with chronic conditions such as hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Our findings reflect that 62% of the top 10 diagnoses to date have resulted in the treatment of chronic conditions demonstrating that virtual primary care can improve access to needed care with the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce overall costs. Turning to our Medicare business, we're well positioned to achieve another year of above market growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership. For 2023, we expanded our Medicare Advantage offering to 145 new counties and added PPO plans in 210 counties, significantly increasing our reach into this important market as we continue to deliver differentiated value for seniors with strong core benefits and industry-leading supplemental offerings. With widespread pressure on the cost of daily living, affordability and value are more important for seniors than ever, and our health plans are positioned to meet their needs. Nearly 75% of our Medicare Advantage plans will have a $0 premium and no copays for primary care in 2023. Our supplemental benefits include popular over-the-counter offerings, transportation, dental and vision, as well as in-home support and healthy groceries. Seniors on our plans will also now have a simplified way to access and keep track of their benefits with a single prepaid card that is customized with spending amounts for their unique benefits and can be used at thousands of participating retailers or on an online portal. Medicare Star Ratings remain a key focus area across Elevance Health. Many of our affiliated Medicare Advantage plans continue to earn high quality scores and we're particularly pleased with the performance of our HealthSun Health Plans in Florida, which received a five star rating for the sixth year in a row in the recently released 2023 Medicare Advantage Star Ratings, which will impact the 2024 payment year. In aggregate, we did see a modest drop in the percentage of our members in four star or higher rated plans for the 2024 payment year, predominantly due to the end of COVID-era relief. And while we will decline by less than the overall industry, we remain intensely focused on our long-term goal of achieving and maintaining star ratings at the high end of all Medicare Advantage plans in our markets. Carelon continues to accelerate its impact and drive differentiated value for Elevance Health Plan members. In the third quarter, we began implementing and rapidly scaling the myNEXUS post-acute care management product, which is now serving our Medicare Advantage members in 15 markets with plans to add more markets in the coming quarters. This new product offering represents a major service line expansion that helps optimize appropriate levels of care post inpatient discharge by working with acute and post-acute facilities to safely manage patient transitions and thereby reduce hospital readmissions and average length of stay. Carelon is also delivering distinctive cost and quality results for our commercial business at scale. As we discussed earlier this year, Carelon\u2019s AIM Specialty Health business expanded its risk-based contract with our commercial health plans to perform focused management of select clinical conditions such as oncology, surgery and diagnostic imaging to cover our entire 14 state footprint at the beginning of this year. AIM has been performing well year-to-date, benefiting our commercial members while producing stable, predictable cost of care for complex conditions for our commercial health plans and driving growth for Carelon. Our enterprise-wide focus on health equity remains central to our strategy and continues to guide our business decisions and targeted investments. We were pleased that our Simply Healthcare plan in Florida recently achieved Health Equity Plus accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance with an almost perfect score. Similarly, Anthem Blue Cross' individual exchange plan in California achieved NCQA distinction in Multicultural Health Care. Awards like these show our commitment and progress to identify and address local, social and physical drivers of health with an emphasis on members who need us most. These results would not be possible without the dedication of our more than 100,000 associates. And I would like to thank them for the important work they do and the impact they make every day. Their passion and commitment is reflected in our recent recognition as a great place to work for the third consecutive year, and also in our inclusion on the 2022 Fortune Best Places to Work For and People's, Companies That Care list. Our associates take pride in the work they do and the difference their contributions make to our company, our members, and the community. We see this every day and most recently in the results of our associate engagement survey, which showed that 96% of associates understand and are inspired by our purpose to improve the health of humanity. These strong results and national recognitions reflect our commitment to leadership and represent our employees\u2019 experience defined by high levels of trust, respect, credibility, fairness, and pride, and help our efforts to recruit and retain top talent, a reflection of our culture. Our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $7.53, an increase of approximately 11% year-over-year driven by broad-based momentum across our enterprise. We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy and ongoing growth of health benefits and services businesses, progressing us further down our path of transforming from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. We ended the third quarter with 47.3 million members growing 2.2 million or nearly 5% year-over-year, including growth of 232,000 members in the third quarter. Our industry-leading organic enrollment growth, which constituted nearly 90% of our total enrollment growth year-over-year, was led by strong sales in our commercial fee-based membership, growth in Medicaid driven in large part by the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and growth in excess of the overall market in our individual Medicare Advantage business, primarily driven by dual eligible members. We supplemented strong organic growth with the acquisitions of the Paramount and Integra Medicaid health plans which together added approximately 300,000 Medicaid members earlier this year. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $39.6 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion or approximately 11% over the prior quarter with strong growth in each of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid, including the acquisitions of Integra and Paramount; Medicare; and commercial risk and fee-based membership growth and premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends in all of our health benefits lines. Our services businesses, Carelon and IngenioRx produced a very strong growth as we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy. IngenioRx grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while the other segment comprised primarily of Carelon, grew operating revenue 26%. Carelon and IngenioRx are delivering significant value to our Commercial and Government health plans. And consistent with our strategy, we continue to increase the breadth and depth of services Carelon is providing. Revenue eliminating consolidation, a proxy for affiliated business between our risk-based health plans and our services businesses, grew 17% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing approximately 21% of our consolidated benefit expense, up from approximately 20% a year ago. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.2%, a decrease of 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we realigned certain quality improvement expenses incurred since the beginning of this year, which had a favorable impact on our benefit expense ratio and an offsetting unfavorable impact on our SG&A expense ratio with no impact on operating earnings. Excluding the impact of the accounting realignment, our benefit expense ratio would have been approximately flat year-over-year and better than our expectations. We were pleased to deliver operating margin expansion in our commercial business, driven in part by stronger medical underwriting performance in our Commercial group risk business. The successful July 1 renewal process where we repriced approximately 25% of our large group risk business and the continued increases in penetration of services into our fee-based businesses contributed to the segment's performance. We were pleased with the retention of our July 1 renewals and have even more confidence as we approach the January 1 renewal date. Elevance Health's SG&A expense ratio in the third quarter was 11.4%, an increase of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by spend to support growth and the realignment of certain quality improvement expenses as previously described. Excluding the realignment, our SG&A ratio would have improved by approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Third quarter operating cash flow was $4.9 billion or 3.1x net income, driven primarily by the early receipt of certain fourth quarter premium revenue from CMS during the third quarter. We also paid our share of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's litigation settlement of approximately $500 million in the quarter. Excluding both of these items, operating cash flow would have been $3 billion or 1.9x net income, another indication of high quality earnings. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39.7% in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock for $579 million. Year-to-date, we've been opportunistic with respect to share repurchases during periods of volatility in our share price and have already repurchased 3.7 million shares for $1.7 billion, exceeding our initial outlook of repurchasing at least $1.5 billion in 2022. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days in claims payable stood at 47.7 days at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of 0.1 days sequentially but an increase of 0.9 days year-over-year. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year earnings outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $28.95, implying growth of approximately 15% of the adjusted baseline of $25.20 provided at the beginning of the year. Our businesses are continuing to perform well with strong momentum that we expect will carry into 2023. While we will not provide specific guidance for 2023 on this call, I would like to review some known tailwinds and headwinds worth considering as we continue planning for 2023. Starting with the tailwinds, the continued execution of our commercial margin recovery in 2023 through disciplined underwriting to cover our forward view of medical cost trends, enhanced operating efficiencies and ongoing strategies to improve the productivity and profitability of our commercial fee-based business. The growth we anticipate in our individual ACA and employer-sponsored membership as consumers transition coverage when Medicaid eligibility redeterminations resume. We expect strong earnings growth in Medicare Advantage driven by membership growth in excess of the broader market and operating margin expansion that we expect will be driven by three primary factors. Number one, having 73% of our Medicare Advantage members in four-star or higher-rated plans for the 2023 payment year, an increase of 15 percentage points year-over-year. Number two, the continued recovery and risk adjustment as utilization has returned to more normalized levels. And number three, a relatively strong funding environment for the overall industry in 2023. Finally, we expect ongoing momentum in Carelon services and IngenioRx, which will carry into next year. Our tailwinds will be weighed against one known headwind, and that is the membership attrition and related impacts on our Medicaid business is eligibility redeterminations are conducted over the course of the next year. Although interest rates continue to rise rapidly, investment income is not expected to be a material tailwind or headwind. In 2022, we enjoyed significant outperformance in our alternative investments in the first half of the year. Rising interest rates are expected to benefit the second half, and we are anticipating a full year of benefit from higher rates in 2023. While performance in both years is expected to be strong overall, I would not call out investment income as a material tailwind or headwind for either 2023 or 2022 at this point. We\u2019re also mindful of the uncertain economic environment and the risk that business conditions could deteriorate. While the balance and resilience of our enterprise and the momentum we have across our businesses leaves us well-positioned for growth in the coming years, a more severe recession could create challenges. Our associates are prepared to adapt to any change in the business environment with detailed plans that ensure we will remain positioned to meet the unique needs of our clients and customers as they evolve with a commitment to affordability and value throughout. Accordingly, at this point in time, we expect to produce another year of growth in adjusted earnings per share in line with our long-term target compound annual growth rate in 2023, which is consistent with the current consensus estimate. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. In closing, we continue to execute against the strategic priorities we mapped out at our 2021 Investor Conference and are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter while also continuing to reinvest in our business, better positioning us to deliver strong growth for years to come. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. This is Austin on for Justin here. On commercial margin, just focusing on that for a second. You guys showed some sequential improvement there, but it looks like you probably need around 300 basis points to kind of hit that 2025 target range that you laid out there. Just curious, on the pacing of that, how much are you expecting to come in 2023 and 2024? And then maybe a slight follow-up there. You mentioned retention, John. How did that track versus typical on those July 1 renewals? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. No, thank you for the question, and maybe I\u2019ll start out and then turn it over to Morgan Kendrick to fine-tune some of the comments on retention. But in terms of the pacing, as I had stated 90 days ago, we expect that 300 basis points is a 2025 target, and it will be a little bit more heavily weighted to the beginning half of the time frame. So as you know, we just re-priced about 25% of our large group fully insured business here on July 1. We\u2019re going to reprice about 50% of that business on January 1. The other 25% goes throughout the year. Obviously, it\u2019s going to take a couple of years for that to get to the point where it needs to get to. And then the \u2013 really, the really nice trajectory and improvement we\u2019re having on upselling our fee-based businesses, our 5:1 to 3:1 strategy, it\u2019s going very much accordance to our expectations and the plans that we laid out, which actually do have us going through 2025. So I think the short answer to your question is a lot more of the improvements early on, but we will take till 2025 to get there. With that, Morgan?\nMorgan Kendrick: Thanks, John, and thanks for the question, Justin. As John said, this is going to be \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a bit to get it completely turned. July came in actually as expected. Certainly, there was some attrition in the large group risk business. To give you some concept there as it relate \u2013 context here as it relates to January, John said about 50% of that business is up for renewal. We have just released those in market. So it\u2019s a bit early to tell, but our expectations are that there will be some attrition, which is \u2013 would be natural when we\u2019re right pricing this business and we\u2019re unmoved by anything being different than expected as we move forward.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Morgan, and thanks, Austin, for the question. And I think as you heard from both John and Morgan, we feel we\u2019re making really good progress in this business. And as I shared in my opening comments, we\u2019re seeing really strong uptake, particularly in our fee-based business, along with the disciplined process. And so overall, it met our expectations on attrition to be real specific. So overall, feel very good about the quarter and where we\u2019re heading on commercial. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. Maybe just get you to comment a little bit on the trends in the government business. I know you swung to a little bit of a decline in margin year-to-year in the government. Can you just parse out a little bit more what you\u2019re seeing there? And then any read on the landscape files and your expectations around MA growth next year? I know you said, John, I think, solid growth. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any way to flesh that out further at this early date.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the question, A.J. So, our Government Business division is actually performing very well. And for the year, we\u2019re certainly going to be posting some very strong results. Both Medicaid and Medicare have been growing nicely. And I think that\u2019s evidenced by the excellent top line growth we\u2019ve seen of over 13% year-over-year. Medicaid\u2019s performance is strong, but for Medicaid, and we\u2019ve said this in the past, on a quarterly basis, results can be a bit more variable and susceptible to swings. And when viewed in isolation, any one quarter could be misleading. Medicare is continue to perform consistent with our expectations and, as you know, has significant upside for 2023. If you think about Medicare and the improving star ratings that I talked about in my prepared comments, the more complete and accurate risk scoring that will allow us to enhance the revenue in those areas. We feel very well positioned for the future of our Medicare Advantage book. And in terms of 2023 growth, it is premature to provide specifics associated with 2023 growth. But our goal is to clearly grow faster than the industry. And we have done that on a percentage basis now for the last several years in a row and expect to do that for the next several years ongoing. So thank you for the question, A.J.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And thanks, A.J. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government Business, to provide a little bit more color on our Medicare Advantage. It\u2019s early. We just started the AEP process. And as John said, we feel confident about above-market growth, but she can give you a little perspective on just how we\u2019re seeing the marketplace. Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Yes. Thank you, Gail, and good morning, A.J. As Gail said, it was certainly very early in the Medicare Advantage annual election period. But we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve seen so far around our competitive positioning. When we think about our supplemental benefits, they really compare favorably with our competitors, and we really lead the industry in terms of our everyday extras, our over-the-counter offerings, transportation benefits and certainly those things that are focused on addressing the whole health needs of our members and those social drivers of health. Additionally, as you know, we actually improved our footprint by expanding into 145 new counties on the HMO side and then 210 counties from a PPO perspective. So while we\u2019re early in this process based on the feedback we\u2019re getting from our distribution channel and others, we feel very good about how we are positioned as we head into AEP and look forward to continued growth in this business. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Thanks and good morning. Can you talk a little bit about IngenioRx? And what I\u2019m interested in is both progress in cross sales for 2023 that you\u2019re seeing thus far in the self-insured book. And then with the contract with CVS ending in 2024, just wondering if you\u2019re entering into sort of a rebidding process or what the strategy is on a go-forward basis for that. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lance. I\u2019m going to have Pete Haytaian, who leads that business, give you a perspective on Ingenio. But overall, I\u2019d just say we\u2019re really pleased seeing some really, really strong growth in Ingenio and more importantly, integrating it into our 5:1 to 3:1 strategy. So I think Pete can provide you a lot more granularity on kind of what we\u2019re seeing in the market. Pete?\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll answer that question. We are very pleased with both the operating performance and the growth in Ingenio. Just to put a little bit more color on that. We are, as you know, trying to be a different PBM. We\u2019re talking about the integrated whole health value proposition. And that does continue to play through nicely in the marketplace. This year, we\u2019re seeing as it relates to your specific question on the ASO growth and 5:1 to 3:1, about a 300% improvement year-over-year in terms of net new members that we\u2019re selling this year. We\u2019re seeing good RFP activity. I\u2019d say really strong performance in the middle and down market where we perform very, very well financially and where integration actually plays very well. Up market, as you would expect, there\u2019s a little bit more stickiness, especially in light of the economic situation we\u2019re in. But overall, we feel very good about our growth and prospects as we move forward. As we head into next year, we\u2019re already into the 2023 selling season. It\u2019s well underway. We have good visibility on our growth. Again, we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in the middle market and down market. The feedback we\u2019re getting right now from the brokers from a distribution perspective is our headline rates look really good. The other thing that we\u2019re very focused on as it relates to Ingenio is upselling additional products and services. So things like cost relief programs, specialty condition management programs and digital adherence programs. So it\u2019s moving in the right direction.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Was interested if you could just talk about the competitive environment and managed Medicaid a bit particularly as we\u2019re in a pretty active RFP cycle right now and with a couple of other big states coming up and with a couple of the competitors having \u2013 shown some improved momentum in some of the recent RFP results. So, interested just in the competitive backdrop and then what Elevance is doing right now strategically or tactically to try to keep your competitive edge of Medicaid. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. I\u2019m going to ask Felicia Norwood to address your question.\nFelicia Norwood: So, good morning, Scott. In many respects, the Medicaid space has always been competitive, but you\u2019re right, it\u2019s certainly become hyper competitive recently and we continue to be, I think, well positioned around our success. When I take a look at the RFP process, as you know, states really delayed part of the RFP process in the midst of COVID, but things have certainly wrapped up significantly over the past year or so. When I take a look at where we are, our focus has really been around health equity, population health. You heard Gail referenced earlier our NCQA distinction with respect to health equity. And our state partners are certainly looking at health plans who can help them improve outcomes and focus specifically on those health equity areas that we\u2019ve been working on here at Elevance Health. So I feel strongly about our ability to kind of elevate and advance health for our members and address the needs of our state partners at a local level. When I look at the RFP opportunities, we\u2019ve been focused on certainly California was significant, a really big win for us. We won in every county, we were able to win in and we actually picked up a county that was a new county for us, so a very strong performance there. We recently also re-procured our RFP in Puerto Rico coming in first, and that demonstrated to me continued strong momentum in terms of our ability to address the needs of our state partners. And most recently yesterday having the DC City Council approved a new win for us in the district. So I continue to see momentum around our value proposition, being able to respond to the needs of our state customers and meet our Medicaid members where they are as we continue to focus on health equity, improved outcomes and advancing those issues that we know are very important to our state partners.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on medical cost trend. I think the MCR was flat year-over-year, excluding the accounting adjustment. Last quarter, John, I think you had talked about medical cost trend being elevated in the back half of the year, but it sounds like that might have come in a little bit better than your expectations. So what did you see play out by line of business? And as we think about your outlook for next year, how are you thinking utilization will trend into 2023? And if I could just add a quick clarification on the accounting adjustment, could you provide more details on what costs moved out of benefit expenses? And I guess, importantly, whether future periods will be impacted by this change? Thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the questions, Nathan. So let me do the easy one first and that was the accounting adjustment. So during the third quarter, CMS provided clarifying guidance on the types of cost that can be included in the quality improvement cost and therefore, considered benefit expense versus those that need to be classified as SG&A. In our GAAP presentations have historically always mirrored the CMS definitions and requirements. So when CMS clarified those definitions, we realigned our reporting accordingly. And so just to be clear, the impact for the third quarter was to improve MOR by about a 0.5%, which would then make the negative impact on SG&A about 0.5% with no impact on the bottom line, clearly a reclass. For the full year, there will be about a 20 basis point impact on each of those. And then in terms, and we always, always try to be fully transparent. So, we wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the nuances in this reporting and what we will see by the end of the year of about a 20 basis point benefit to MLR for this clarification that CMS provided that we aligned with. So hopefully that helped from that perspective. And then in terms of the of the trends and costs and utilization in general, as you\u2019ve stated, you pointed out without the reclassification, our MLR would\u2019ve been flat, which is actually a nice improvement because of a mix on a mix adjusted basis. Since our government membership now is a higher percent of our fully insured membership than it was a year ago. So third quarter did come in better than expected, but the overall cost structure of the health system is still a bit higher than what it would\u2019ve been had COVID never occurred. But I think the most important element of all this is that our trends continue to be in line with our expectations in each of our lines of businesses. So, associated with lines of businesses, Medicaid is doing slightly better than historical levels. Medicare is very much in line. We\u2019re seeing outpatient a bit higher and inpatient a bit lower, helping offset to have a more normalized trend. And then commercial has been very consistent with our last several quarters where outpatient continues to be higher, but even more so than the benefit that we\u2019re seeing in inpatient. And so that\u2019s been all part of the process and all part of the guidance. So, we\u2019re obviously not going to comment on 2023 at this point in time, but hopefully that answers all your questions.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great, thanks. Good morning everybody. So, I guess just regarding the potential migration in 2023 of the ineligible Medicaid members into commercial and exchange plans, I guess I\u2019m curious whether or not there\u2019s been any evolution in your key states that might allow Elevance to more directly funnel your own ineligible Medicaid members into your own exchange plans. So could this be more of a controlled process for the industry now versus maybe where it stood a year ago? Or would you still just describe the Medicaid market environment for 2023 is really just kind of a big jump ball for all MCOs to try to grab the ineligible Medicaid members next year? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, Steve, thanks for your question. I think just a couple of, I\u2019d say clarifications as we go through this process. We\u2019ve been working very, very closely with our states and across our enterprise. And a few things that I think are important that we\u2019ve shared with you in the past. One, we\u2019ve had a long time to plan for this and a long time to discuss this with each of our specific states, and each state will have a bit of a different process, but where we can, we\u2019re sharing data that the states allow us to do that. We\u2019re also working with community organizations to make sure that first and foremost, that everyone who\u2019s eligible for coverage retains eligibility for coverage. And I think that\u2019s probably where we start in this whole process, is ensure that those, just because of administrative things, et cetera, that we ensure that they have the right eligibility for the right program. For those that are not going to be eligible for Medicaid, again, we\u2019re working across our commercial business as well as our Medicaid business to provide, I think the most education and seamless transition. If you start just a little bit of facts for our business. If you think about our 14 commercial states, Medicaid membership in those states grew roughly 7.5 million beneficiaries in those states. We, as part of our exchange footprint, now cover pretty much all of the counties in our footprint of 14 states and also have incredibly strong market share, not only in the exchange, but also in our commercial benefits business. So, we think there\u2019s an opportunity, obviously with our brand recognition our dedication to this membership, our community involvement, and the work we\u2019re doing, again, with community partners, educating our commercial business to be quite frankly, well positioned and don\u2019t see it as a jump ball. We think we\u2019re actually quite well positioned in those states. And in terms of our own Medicaid membership, approximately 2.7 million members \u2013 million of those members came in as a result of the PAG and obviously we know those members well, they know us well, they recognize our brand. And so, again, based on the state rules, and regulations will be working very closely to help that transition. So, I feel like, given the time we\u2019ve had to plan the guidance from the administration, our work with the states, that actually this is going to be a much more organized process than I would call it just to jump all with a real opportunity for those who lead in the market to have an opportunity to move those members and keep coverage, which again, is our primary goal here. So again, thanks for the question. And we look forward to continuing to update everyone on our progress there. Thank you. Next question.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Cottrell: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I just wanted to ask about the negotiating environment with health systems. There\u2019s been some conversation in the market about financial pressures across health systems leading to increased value-based care adoption. Are you seeing that play out across your negotiations and your contracting team? And do you expect that to ultimately have a positive impact for you all over the next year or two?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, thanks to the question, Rob. A couple of things. One, I think it\u2019s been well documented that, our contracts are on a three year-end duration, so we negotiate again about a third of them each year. So that just gives you a little context to the sort of discussions. Clearly, there is more cost pressure in the system. But overall, I would say our deals are coming in within normal range and we continually are proactively managing that contract and our products, obviously to offer affordability, continuing to look at our clinical strategies, ensure we can maintain our long-term trends. While also as we shared with you, maintain our underwriting discipline to price to our forward review of those costs. Ultimately, it\u2019s affordability that\u2019s paramount for our customers, particularly in this economic environment. We take that very, very seriously. Specifically to your question about value-based contracts with our providers, we are having those discussions. And quite frankly, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress on our value-based contracts. We\u2019ve shared with you roughly 60% of our total contracts are in value-based, and our goal is to move a lot more of those at least a third by 2025 to downside risk. I\u2019m really pleased to share that we\u2019ve made really good progress even in this last year and in the last quarter. And in now where we were in sort of low double digits now in high teens in downside risk. So making great progress against our goal to get to more downside risk in our contracts as well as value-based care. So back to your question, we do think that there is an opportunity to continue to move more of these to value-based care. We are seeing progress not just on the hospital side, but across the broader provider care continuum. And the other thing that I think\u2019s important in trying to be a good partner with our care providers is we\u2019re also looking at how to reduce the administrative burden that they face. So how do we accelerate the work we\u2019re doing on data sharing, reduce some of the \u2013 I\u2019ll call administrative care review processes that may not have the highest value. And I think those are big opportunities for us as well, in addition to just trying to increase rates. So we\u2019ve seen progress there and we\u2019re committed to continuing to work with care providers so that, obviously, that we have a good long-term partnership with them. But overall, we\u2019re not seeing anything outside of our normal ranges right now and have been very successful with these strategies. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much for taking my question. Again, I want to go back to your earlier comment today around Sydney Health and virtual healthcare. So you talked about, 6 million visits per month. You talked about improving outcomes and costs, but I\u2019m really interested in. When we think about 2023, are you offering a product in the marketplace where you have a lower premium, where your primary care doctor is virtual? So that would be my first question. And then secondly, is there a way to quantify when we think about the potential cost benefit of utilizing virtual primary care?\nGail Boudreaux: So thanks for the question, Lisa. I\u2019m going to ask Morgan to add some commentary, but just an overview. Yes, we are. So first, Sydney is our front door to healthcare. So we have really embedded all of our capabilities in Sydney. And what I shared with you are a couple things. One, that virtual primary care is one of the elements of our care delivery strategy. And Morgan talk about the product offerings that we have there as well. But we\u2019re also seeing it, and you saw some of the early data around an opportunity to help us manage chronics in a much more efficient way. And so we\u2019re seeing a lot of uptake in that. And it\u2019s also embedded into what our customers are selecting. So we\u2019re adding a lot more capability inside of Sydney. So a couple of very important just quick facts, but let me turn it over to Morgan to share with you a little bit about the product strategy, which is an element of our affordability offerings for the market.\nMorgan Kendrick: Right, and thanks, Gail. And thanks Lisa for the question. When you think about the commercial group business, you\u2019ve got generational cohorts, four of them with Boomers X, Y and Z that are part of the actual the makeup. And of course the way they engage certainly is indeed different. Various modalities are very important to us. And as such, we have products that we are launching that have a virtual first component where one can elect a primary care physician that would be a digital connection as opposed to a physical connection. But it also allows for the opportunity to move into the physical world within the value-based constructs that Gail described in our value-based network strategies to keep a tight closed loop integration, so to speak, on how this works. One in particular that we\u2019ve already launched for January versus in our Nevada market, which is a combination of a partnership with a single entity, but layered with a digital fresh first front end. The economics of that arrangement are quite attractive in the market, and we\u2019re expecting nice pull through is the enrollment period concludes. But this is the beginning of it. We\u2019ve been adding the virtual components to all of our commercial self-funded business and risk business over the past year and a half. And as such, we\u2019ll continue to build products anchored around those assets. Thanks again for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, thanks, Morgan. And Lisa, just sort of two important concepts that I want to reiterate. One that we\u2019ve embedded virtual capabilities for our customers across the board. And we\u2019re also aligning those with our high performance networks. And we talk about best costs in the marketplace and what\u2019s really driving a lot of our growth. It\u2019s that affordability. And again, it\u2019s not just virtual for virtual by itself, but it\u2019s aligned to our high performance network strategy. And then second, as Morgan said, we\u2019re in \u2013 I would say earlier days, but we have been beginning to launch a number of virtual only products. But again, they have tied to physical assets or high performance network. So again, really trying to drive best cost and quality and outcomes for our members. Next question, please. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great, thanks. I guess I want to go back to a comment that John made in prepared comments about the impact of a recession. I guess, the company historically has talked about the kind of the balanced business mix between Commercial, Medicaid, and how the two businesses kind of offset each other during a recession. So one, I guess first you didn't mention a recession either as a tailwind, I'm sorry, as a headwind. So I assume, does that mean that you don't assume a recession that the guidance or you assume a modest one has no impact? And then what exactly do you mean that if it's a severe recession, how should we think about how that impacts a company like Elevance given your business mix? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll address that, and I think that there's a few things. One, we are mindful of the economic environment under which John in the headwinds and tailwinds, where he talked about one specific known Medicaid. He also did reference the broader economic environment that we're planning for across a whole series of scenarios. But I want to take you back in terms of our business because we are a much more diversified business than we have been at any other time in our company's history. And just putting some facts around that, today that 25% of our premium roughly is in our commercial business, whereas that number was 70% in 2008. And so as you think about that, the diversity of our businesses and in strong, we've been able to perform in both good and bad economic times certainly in stronger economic times. The commercial business continues to grow, but we haven't seen any impact in terms of our commercial business today. And we're still seeing strong growth in ads inside of our fee-based business. But clearly our focus is on, as you just heard in the last question, affordable products driving a differentiated value for our consumers. We've been able to demonstrate that. Just a quick fact that we talk a lot about in our own business. Our growth as you've seen in the fee-based with some of our most discerning customers we have been consolidating business from multi-carrier to single carrier over the last several years. We added another eight additional clients for January of this year that consolidate with us. So these are just a couple of proof points in terms of the, I would say the resiliency right now of our commercial business. And then obviously in more difficult times Medicaid businesses tend to grow well and take on some of that. We're also in a very different environment than we were in the last recession, and that recession we didn't have the ACA and the opportunity for individuals to go in, in a subsidized manner. And as you heard from us, we also now have full coverage in our counties in ACA exchange business. And then we think the Medicare business where we have zero premium plans is also quite resilient. So, across our book certainly we're mindful of an economic downturn. We're planning for it in our businesses. We've been investing heavily in digital and trying to ensure that we can maintain our own cost structure. So those are the kinds of things and playbooks that we have inside of our business. So it's not that we're not planning and thinking about that business, but we do feel we have a much more resilient business and a much more diversified business that one business line is in dominating our company as it had in the past. So, and also I would ask \u2013 I would add that Caroline in times obviously adds, we have a big roadmap for Caroline to add additional opportunities to impact the affordability of our health plan business and take on more risk. Just a couple of the examples I shared this morning between AIM and myNEXUS. We've got a, I think a long runway there, and that again is all about driving affordability. So I guess in short, yes, we're planning for it. Yes, we're being prudent and diligent. And second, we know that affordability and differentiated value is going to be critical in a market where customers are strained. And those are the kind of products that we're putting in the market. And we feel we've got a nice a nice breath of those right now, much more so than we've ever had. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi, good morning. Had a quick clarification for John and then \u2013 and then maybe a quick one for Felicia. John, just on the re-class of the quality improvement incentives to G&A; just wondering if there's any rebate implications retroactively from that? And then for Felicia as we look at the 2023 Medicare benefits offering, I mean one of the key places where it really looks like Elevance stands out as in special supplemental benefits for chronically ill just in your individual MA offering your funding level there really looks substantially higher than many of your competitors. I was just wondering why the focus on that benefit specifically and what percent of your individual MA will avail themselves of that particular benefit? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, Gary. I'll answer the first part of your question, then turn it over Felicia for your second question. But in terms of the impact on rebates, it was de-minimus. The vast majority of the reclassification impact that the commercial line of business and while we do have occasional MLR rebates in commercial, they're not nearly as prevalent as they are in some of our, in Medicaid at this point in time. So there was really de-minimus that's why I said there's virtually no bottom line impact. Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Sure. And good morning, Gary. When I think about our Medicare Advantage business, we've been always very focused on a portfolio that takes a look at individuals who are complex and chronic. And our dual special needs plans have always been an area where we look to grow. Today, I think we represent probably the third largest footprint with respect to dual eligible individuals and within our footprint we're second. We believe that we have the capabilities as we sit within our Medicaid \u2013 Medicare business and certainly as you take a look at Carolina to be able to be able to deliver a value proposition to these individuals that's differentiated. So when we take a look at how we are appropriately priced and competitive in the marketplace is certainly based on our strategy around playing to those stress and being able to partner and look to do those individuals or work with those individuals in a way that's differentiating. So I think our competitive cost structure and the way that we think about our duals products certainly gives us the ability to address their specific needs.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, I just wanted to go back to Carelon for a second. Any way to frame what percent of your post-acute spin for MA today is being delegated to MyNEXUS or any of your other assets? And then kind of what are the targets for that business over time? Just any way to, quantify and put some numbers around it. I think, I may have underappreciated that the tail around this.\nPeter Haytaian: Yes, thanks Whit for the question. In terms of percentages specific numbers on that, we're not going to sort of get into that. But the goal here is for our post-acute offering via MyNEXUS to cover all of our Medicare advantage business from a post-acute care perspective. We started on this journey in the middle of this year launching in July. We've seen really good success. We also had another integration in September. We will complete all the Medicare advantage markets in early 2023. And so you can assume more broadly that as it relates to post-acute care management for the Medicare business, we will be covering the management of all that population.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, thanks Pete. And a number that we do share more broadly is the percentage of spend that Carelon manages for Elevance Health. And that has continued to increase and it's around 21%. So just to give you a little bit of perspective, and it's obviously a number that, we will we continue to have a bigger impact on. Next question, please?\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi, thanks. I wanted to come back to the comments around commercial renewal. And John's prepared, you talked about being even more confident about Jan 1 than July 1, which was successful. Wondered if you could put a finer point on the factors that drive that confidence, and then to what extent do those same factors benefit growth beyond renewal and or help your catchers met for catching Medicaid from redetermination.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. I'm going to ask Morgan to address your question.\nMorgan Kendrick: Thanks Dave. To \u2013 express confidence, I think that July played out as we indicated exactly as we expected. The renewals that we needed we obtained, and of course there was some attrition in the book that was certainly planned, that same phenomenon we're seeing and in we're the very beginnings of it for January 1. I think the confidence that was alluded to earlier is in the actual position in which we're pricing the business. We sort of got in the spot last year, pricing early for 2021 or 2022 and then things reveal differently in the fall. That's sort of shaping up as planned as we see right now. So the confidence in the numbers, in the market are there. When we think about this concept of a catchers met with Medicaid redetermination, there's business that stays on the Medicaid side. There's business that's going to move to the commercial side, be it group or individual. Gail alluded to the fact that we've done a really nice job in expanding our footprint to cover roughly 95% of the population of the geographies we serve \u2013 from a commercial individual ACA perspective. And then, we have very strong penetration in the commercial risk and non-risk business would also be part of that catchers met, so to speak for the group side. So all in we're confident in A the results from July B how we're [Technical Difficulty].\nDave Windley: Yes. Hi, thanks for sitting in. Just wanted to ask one follow up on the group risk business. I was hoping you could give us a sense of what the in-group membership trends were in the quarter. Are you starting to see those slow a little bit as maybe the economy gets a little bit more uncertain? I guess basically what I'm trying to get a sense of is whether we can attribute all the sequential decline to the attrition on the seven one renewals or whether the impact was larger, smaller than that, and maybe masked by some of those in-group trends. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, thanks for the question. I think in total, I think I shared this in sort of the recession response. We really haven't seen a lot of change in, in-group and actually it's been up a little bit. So I wouldn't necessarily call it a trend, but it's been running fairly stable. And I think as you think about, where employers are, they're holding onto their employees, they've got a number of jobs still open, so we're not seeing any impact yet across any of our commercial business on the attrition side and actually are seeing some net ads. So thank you very much for the question. And thank you, operator. In closing, we're pleased with the broad based momentum across our businesses and are confident that our ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue delivering against the financial targets we shared with you at our investor conference last year. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to deliver an enhanced value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health and have a great rest of week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11 a.m. today through November 18, 2022.

            "content": "Yes. Thanks a lot. I'll answer that question. We are very pleased with both the operating performance and the growth in Ingenio. Just to put a little bit more color on that. We are, as you know, trying to be a different PBM. We're talking about the integrated whole health value proposition. And that does continue to play through nicely in the marketplace. This year, we're seeing as it relates to your specific question on the ASO growth and 5:1 to 3:1, about a 300% improvement year-over-year in terms of net new members that we're selling this year. We're seeing good RFP activity. I'd say really strong performance in the middle and down market where we perform very, very well financially and where integration actually plays very well. Up market, as you would expect, there's a little bit more stickiness, especially in light of the economic situation we're in. But overall, we feel very good about our growth and prospects as we move forward. As we head into next year, we're already into the 2023 selling season. It's well underway. We have good visibility on our growth. Again, we're seeing a lot of activity in the middle market and down market. The feedback we're getting right now from the brokers from a distribution perspective is our headline rates look really good. The other thing that we're very focused on as it relates to Ingenio is upselling additional products and services. So things like cost relief programs, specialty condition management programs and digital adherence programs. So it's moving in the right direction. Yes, thanks Whit for the question. In terms of percentages specific numbers on that, we're not going to sort of get into that. But the goal here is for our post-acute offering via MyNEXUS to cover all of our Medicare advantage business from a post-acute care perspective.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another strong quarter. This morning, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings per share of $6.68 and adjusted earnings per share of $7.53 ahead of expectations and reflecting strong revenue and earnings growth across our businesses. Based on our year-to-date results and confidence in our momentum, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings guidance to greater than $28.95 per share, representing growth of approximately 15% off of the adjusted baseline we provided at the beginning of the year. Before we discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to spend a moment on the recent hurricanes that have tragically impacted the lives of people in Florida and Puerto Rico, including some of our own health plan members and associates who live and work in the impacted areas. As an organization deeply rooted in our communities, the impact of these disasters is personal. I'd like to thank our associates who are leading efforts to provide water, food, durable medical equipment, transportation and shelter, along with our clinical teams, social workers and behavioral health specialists for their extraordinary commitment to support those in need. It's in time such as these that our culture shines through and I am proud of our associates for the work they are doing to support their colleagues and communities. Turning to our business performance. We are pleased to report ongoing broad-based momentum across Elevance Health, a testament to our integrated and personalized whole health approach to addressing the physical, behavioral and social needs of our members and communities. Our focused efforts and investments in these areas are resonating with employers and state partners driving strong organic membership growth in our commercial and government health benefits businesses, as well as rapid growth for Carelon and IngenioRx. While our business trends remain strong, we are mindful of the inflationary pressure and general uncertainty in the economic environment and are focused on delivering affordability and value for customers and consumers in all of our businesses. Medical membership grew 5% year-over-year to 47.3 million members. Over the past year, we've grown to serve 2.2 million more consumers with both our commercial and government businesses delivering robust growth that solidifies our position as the largest carrier by U.S. based medical membership. In the employer market, we continue to gain market share on the strength of our leading cost of care position and innovative consumer products such as our total health connection suite of advocacy solutions. Total health connections is an example of where we're delivering an integrated whole health experience for consumers by guiding members to the next step in care through a simple, intuitive and personalized experience. Our clinical advocates help members navigate the healthcare system, leveraging real-time data analytics to identify health risks that enable our advocates to personally connect with members and help them proactively manage some medical, behavioral and social issues impacting their health. Health connections has grown more than 60% over the past two years and will support more than 5 million of our members in 2023. In addition to advocacy solutions, our integrated digital offerings are also gaining momentum. Sydney Health, the digital front door for our members' health needs, continues to rapidly expand the number of registered users and is now hosting more than 6 million visits every month. We are also seeing strong member satisfaction with our virtual primary care offering, which is available through Sydney Health and integrated into our commercial products and is increasingly being used to support members with chronic conditions such as hypertension and Type 2 diabetes. Our findings reflect that 62% of the top 10 diagnoses to date have resulted in the treatment of chronic conditions demonstrating that virtual primary care can improve access to needed care with the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce overall costs. Turning to our Medicare business, we're well positioned to achieve another year of above market growth in individual Medicare Advantage membership. For 2023, we expanded our Medicare Advantage offering to 145 new counties and added PPO plans in 210 counties, significantly increasing our reach into this important market as we continue to deliver differentiated value for seniors with strong core benefits and industry-leading supplemental offerings. With widespread pressure on the cost of daily living, affordability and value are more important for seniors than ever, and our health plans are positioned to meet their needs. Nearly 75% of our Medicare Advantage plans will have a $0 premium and no copays for primary care in 2023. Our supplemental benefits include popular over-the-counter offerings, transportation, dental and vision, as well as in-home support and healthy groceries. Seniors on our plans will also now have a simplified way to access and keep track of their benefits with a single prepaid card that is customized with spending amounts for their unique benefits and can be used at thousands of participating retailers or on an online portal. Medicare Star Ratings remain a key focus area across Elevance Health. Many of our affiliated Medicare Advantage plans continue to earn high quality scores and we're particularly pleased with the performance of our HealthSun Health Plans in Florida, which received a five star rating for the sixth year in a row in the recently released 2023 Medicare Advantage Star Ratings, which will impact the 2024 payment year. In aggregate, we did see a modest drop in the percentage of our members in four star or higher rated plans for the 2024 payment year, predominantly due to the end of COVID-era relief. And while we will decline by less than the overall industry, we remain intensely focused on our long-term goal of achieving and maintaining star ratings at the high end of all Medicare Advantage plans in our markets. Carelon continues to accelerate its impact and drive differentiated value for Elevance Health Plan members. In the third quarter, we began implementing and rapidly scaling the myNEXUS post-acute care management product, which is now serving our Medicare Advantage members in 15 markets with plans to add more markets in the coming quarters. This new product offering represents a major service line expansion that helps optimize appropriate levels of care post inpatient discharge by working with acute and post-acute facilities to safely manage patient transitions and thereby reduce hospital readmissions and average length of stay. Carelon is also delivering distinctive cost and quality results for our commercial business at scale. As we discussed earlier this year, Carelon's AIM Specialty Health business expanded its risk-based contract with our commercial health plans to perform focused management of select clinical conditions such as oncology, surgery and diagnostic imaging to cover our entire 14 state footprint at the beginning of this year. AIM has been performing well year-to-date, benefiting our commercial members while producing stable, predictable cost of care for complex conditions for our commercial health plans and driving growth for Carelon. Our enterprise-wide focus on health equity remains central to our strategy and continues to guide our business decisions and targeted investments. We were pleased that our Simply Healthcare plan in Florida recently achieved Health Equity Plus accreditation by the National Committee for Quality Assurance with an almost perfect score. Similarly, Anthem Blue Cross' individual exchange plan in California achieved NCQA distinction in Multicultural Health Care. Awards like these show our commitment and progress to identify and address local, social and physical drivers of health with an emphasis on members who need us most. These results would not be possible without the dedication of our more than 100,000 associates. And I would like to thank them for the important work they do and the impact they make every day. Their passion and commitment is reflected in our recent recognition as a great place to work for the third consecutive year, and also in our inclusion on the 2022 Fortune Best Places to Work For and People's, Companies That Care list. Our associates take pride in the work they do and the difference their contributions make to our company, our members, and the community. We see this every day and most recently in the results of our associate engagement survey, which showed that 96% of associates understand and are inspired by our purpose to improve the health of humanity. These strong results and national recognitions reflect our commitment to leadership and represent our employees' experience defined by high levels of trust, respect, credibility, fairness, and pride, and help our efforts to recruit and retain top talent, a reflection of our culture. Our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? Thanks, Morgan, and thanks, Austin, for the question. And I think as you heard from both John and Morgan, we feel we're making really good progress in this business. And as I shared in my opening comments, we're seeing really strong uptake, particularly in our fee-based business, along with the disciplined process. And so overall, it met our expectations on attrition to be real specific. So overall, feel very good about the quarter and where we're heading on commercial. Next question, please. Yes. And thanks, A.J. Maybe I'll ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government Business, to provide a little bit more color on our Medicare Advantage. It's early. We just started the AEP process. And as John said, we feel confident about above-market growth, but she can give you a little perspective on just how we're seeing the marketplace. Felicia? Thanks for the question. Next question, please. Yes. Thanks for the question, Lance. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian, who leads that business, give you a perspective on Ingenio. But overall, I'd just say we're really pleased seeing some really, really strong growth in Ingenio and more importantly, integrating it into our 5:1 to 3:1 strategy. So I think Pete can provide you a lot more granularity on kind of what we're seeing in the market. Pete? Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood to address your question. Thank you. Next question, please. Next question, please. Well, Steve, thanks for your question. I think just a couple of, I'd say clarifications as we go through this process. We've been working very, very closely with our states and across our enterprise. And a few things that I think are important that we've shared with you in the past. One, we've had a long time to plan for this and a long time to discuss this with each of our specific states, and each state will have a bit of a different process, but where we can, we're sharing data that the states allow us to do that. We're also working with community organizations to make sure that first and foremost, that everyone who's eligible for coverage retains eligibility for coverage. And I think that's probably where we start in this whole process, is ensure that those, just because of administrative things, et cetera, that we ensure that they have the right eligibility for the right program. For those that are not going to be eligible for Medicaid, again, we're working across our commercial business as well as our Medicaid business to provide, I think the most education and seamless transition. If you start just a little bit of facts for our business. If you think about our 14 commercial states, Medicaid membership in those states grew roughly 7.5 million beneficiaries in those states. We, as part of our exchange footprint, now cover pretty much all of the counties in our footprint of 14 states and also have incredibly strong market share, not only in the exchange, but also in our commercial benefits business. So, we think there's an opportunity, obviously with our brand recognition our dedication to this membership, our community involvement, and the work we're doing, again, with community partners, educating our commercial business to be quite frankly, well positioned and don't see it as a jump ball. We think we're actually quite well positioned in those states. And in terms of our own Medicaid membership, approximately 2.7 million members \u2013 million of those members came in as a result of the PAG and obviously we know those members well, they know us well, they recognize our brand. And so, again, based on the state rules, and regulations will be working very closely to help that transition. So, I feel like, given the time we've had to plan the guidance from the administration, our work with the states, that actually this is going to be a much more organized process than I would call it just to jump all with a real opportunity for those who lead in the market to have an opportunity to move those members and keep coverage, which again, is our primary goal here. So again, thanks for the question. And we look forward to continuing to update everyone on our progress there. Thank you. Next question. Yes, thanks to the question, Rob. A couple of things. One, I think it's been well documented that, our contracts are on a three year-end duration, so we negotiate again about a third of them each year. So that just gives you a little context to the sort of discussions. Clearly, there is more cost pressure in the system. But overall, I would say our deals are coming in within normal range and we continually are proactively managing that contract and our products, obviously to offer affordability, continuing to look at our clinical strategies, ensure we can maintain our long-term trends. While also as we shared with you, maintain our underwriting discipline to price to our forward review of those costs. Ultimately, it's affordability that's paramount for our customers, particularly in this economic environment. We take that very, very seriously. Specifically to your question about value-based contracts with our providers, we are having those discussions. And quite frankly, we've made a lot of progress on our value-based contracts. We've shared with you roughly 60% of our total contracts are in value-based, and our goal is to move a lot more of those at least a third by 2025 to downside risk. I'm really pleased to share that we've made really good progress even in this last year and in the last quarter. And in now where we were in sort of low double digits now in high teens in downside risk. So making great progress against our goal to get to more downside risk in our contracts as well as value-based care. So back to your question, we do think that there is an opportunity to continue to move more of these to value-based care. We are seeing progress not just on the hospital side, but across the broader provider care continuum. And the other thing that I think's important in trying to be a good partner with our care providers is we're also looking at how to reduce the administrative burden that they face. So how do we accelerate the work we're doing on data sharing, reduce some of the \u2013 I'll call administrative care review processes that may not have the highest value. And I think those are big opportunities for us as well, in addition to just trying to increase rates. So we've seen progress there and we're committed to continuing to work with care providers so that, obviously, that we have a good long-term partnership with them. But overall, we're not seeing anything outside of our normal ranges right now and have been very successful with these strategies. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. So thanks for the question, Lisa. I'm going to ask Morgan to add some commentary, but just an overview. Yes, we are. So first, Sydney is our front door to healthcare. So we have really embedded all of our capabilities in Sydney. And what I shared with you are a couple things. One, that virtual primary care is one of the elements of our care delivery strategy. And Morgan talk about the product offerings that we have there as well. But we're also seeing it, and you saw some of the early data around an opportunity to help us manage chronics in a much more efficient way. And so we're seeing a lot of uptake in that. And it's also embedded into what our customers are selecting. So we're adding a lot more capability inside of Sydney. So a couple of very important just quick facts, but let me turn it over to Morgan to share with you a little bit about the product strategy, which is an element of our affordability offerings for the market. Yes, thanks, Morgan. And Lisa, just sort of two important concepts that I want to reiterate. One that we've embedded virtual capabilities for our customers across the board. And we're also aligning those with our high performance networks. And we talk about best costs in the marketplace and what's really driving a lot of our growth. It's that affordability. And again, it's not just virtual for virtual by itself, but it's aligned to our high performance network strategy. And then second, as Morgan said, we're in \u2013 I would say earlier days, but we have been beginning to launch a number of virtual only products. But again, they have tied to physical assets or high performance network. So again, really trying to drive best cost and quality and outcomes for our members. Next question, please. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll address that, and I think that there's a few things. One, we are mindful of the economic environment under which John in the headwinds and tailwinds, where he talked about one specific known Medicaid. He also did reference the broader economic environment that we're planning for across a whole series of scenarios. But I want to take you back in terms of our business because we are a much more diversified business than we have been at any other time in our company's history. And just putting some facts around that, today that 25% of our premium roughly is in our commercial business, whereas that number was 70% in 2008. And so as you think about that, the diversity of our businesses and in strong, we've been able to perform in both good and bad economic times certainly in stronger economic times. The commercial business continues to grow, but we haven't seen any impact in terms of our commercial business today. And we're still seeing strong growth in ads inside of our fee-based business. But clearly our focus is on, as you just heard in the last question, affordable products driving a differentiated value for our consumers. We've been able to demonstrate that. Just a quick fact that we talk a lot about in our own business. Our growth as you've seen in the fee-based with some of our most discerning customers we have been consolidating business from multi-carrier to single carrier over the last several years. We added another eight additional clients for January of this year that consolidate with us. So these are just a couple of proof points in terms of the, I would say the resiliency right now of our commercial business. And then obviously in more difficult times Medicaid businesses tend to grow well and take on some of that. We're also in a very different environment than we were in the last recession, and that recession we didn't have the ACA and the opportunity for individuals to go in, in a subsidized manner. And as you heard from us, we also now have full coverage in our counties in ACA exchange business. And then we think the Medicare business where we have zero premium plans is also quite resilient. So, across our book certainly we're mindful of an economic downturn. We're planning for it in our businesses. We've been investing heavily in digital and trying to ensure that we can maintain our own cost structure. So those are the kinds of things and playbooks that we have inside of our business. So it's not that we're not planning and thinking about that business, but we do feel we have a much more resilient business and a much more diversified business that one business line is in dominating our company as it had in the past. So, and also I would ask \u2013 I would add that Caroline in times obviously adds, we have a big roadmap for Caroline to add additional opportunities to impact the affordability of our health plan business and take on more risk. Just a couple of the examples I shared this morning between AIM and myNEXUS. We've got a, I think a long runway there, and that again is all about driving affordability. So I guess in short, yes, we're planning for it. Yes, we're being prudent and diligent. And second, we know that affordability and differentiated value is going to be critical in a market where customers are strained. And those are the kind of products that we're putting in the market. And we feel we've got a nice a nice breath of those right now, much more so than we've ever had. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question, please. Yes, thanks Pete. And a number that we do share more broadly is the percentage of spend that Carelon manages for Elevance Health. And that has continued to increase and it's around 21%. So just to give you a little bit of perspective, and it's obviously a number that, we will we continue to have a bigger impact on. Next question, please? Thank you. I'm going to ask Morgan to address your question. Yes, thanks for the question. I think in total, I think I shared this in sort of the recession response. We really haven't seen a lot of change in, in-group and actually it's been up a little bit. So I wouldn't necessarily call it a trend, but it's been running fairly stable. And I think as you think about, where employers are, they're holding onto their employees, they've got a number of jobs still open, so we're not seeing any impact yet across any of our commercial business on the attrition side and actually are seeing some net ads. So thank you very much for the question. And thank you, operator. In closing, we're pleased with the broad based momentum across our businesses and are confident that our ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue delivering against the financial targets we shared with you at our investor conference last year. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to deliver an enhanced value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health and have a great rest of week."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Gail, and good morning, A.J. As Gail said, it was certainly very early in the Medicare Advantage annual election period. But we're pleased with what we've seen so far around our competitive positioning. When we think about our supplemental benefits, they really compare favorably with our competitors, and we really lead the industry in terms of our everyday extras, our over-the-counter offerings, transportation benefits and certainly those things that are focused on addressing the whole health needs of our members and those social drivers of health. Additionally, as you know, we actually improved our footprint by expanding into 145 new counties on the HMO side and then 210 counties from a PPO perspective. So while we're early in this process based on the feedback we're getting from our distribution channel and others, we feel very good about how we are positioned as we head into AEP and look forward to continued growth in this business. Thank you. So, good morning, Scott. In many respects, the Medicaid space has always been competitive, but you're right, it's certainly become hyper competitive recently and we continue to be, I think, well positioned around our success. When I take a look at the RFP process, as you know, states really delayed part of the RFP process in the midst of COVID, but things have certainly wrapped up significantly over the past year or so. When I take a look at where we are, our focus has really been around health equity, population health. You heard Gail referenced earlier our NCQA distinction with respect to health equity. And our state partners are certainly looking at health plans who can help them improve outcomes and focus specifically on those health equity areas that we've been working on here at Elevance Health. So I feel strongly about our ability to kind of elevate and advance health for our members and address the needs of our state partners at a local level. When I look at the RFP opportunities, we've been focused on certainly California was significant, a really big win for us. We won in every county, we were able to win in and we actually picked up a county that was a new county for us, so a very strong performance there. We recently also re-procured our RFP in Puerto Rico coming in first, and that demonstrated to me continued strong momentum in terms of our ability to address the needs of our state partners. And most recently yesterday having the DC City Council approved a new win for us in the district. So I continue to see momentum around our value proposition, being able to respond to the needs of our state customers and meet our Medicaid members where they are as we continue to focus on health equity, improved outcomes and advancing those issues that we know are very important to our state partners. Sure. And good morning, Gary. When I think about our Medicare Advantage business, we've been always very focused on a portfolio that takes a look at individuals who are complex and chronic. And our dual special needs plans have always been an area where we look to grow. Today, I think we represent probably the third largest footprint with respect to dual eligible individuals and within our footprint we're second. We believe that we have the capabilities as we sit within our Medicaid \u2013 Medicare business and certainly as you take a look at Carolina to be able to be able to deliver a value proposition to these individuals that's differentiated. So when we take a look at how we are appropriately priced and competitive in the marketplace is certainly based on our strategy around playing to those stress and being able to partner and look to do those individuals or work with those individuals in a way that's differentiating. So I think our competitive cost structure and the way that we think about our duals products certainly gives us the ability to address their specific needs."

            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $7.53, an increase of approximately 11% year-over-year driven by broad-based momentum across our enterprise. We are pleased to have delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy and ongoing growth of health benefits and services businesses, progressing us further down our path of transforming from a health benefits company to a lifetime trusted partner in health. We ended the third quarter with 47.3 million members growing 2.2 million or nearly 5% year-over-year, including growth of 232,000 members in the third quarter. Our industry-leading organic enrollment growth, which constituted nearly 90% of our total enrollment growth year-over-year, was led by strong sales in our commercial fee-based membership, growth in Medicaid driven in large part by the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and growth in excess of the overall market in our individual Medicare Advantage business, primarily driven by dual eligible members. We supplemented strong organic growth with the acquisitions of the Paramount and Integra Medicaid health plans which together added approximately 300,000 Medicaid members earlier this year. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $39.6 billion, an increase of $4.1 billion or approximately 11% over the prior quarter with strong growth in each of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid, including the acquisitions of Integra and Paramount; Medicare; and commercial risk and fee-based membership growth and premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends in all of our health benefits lines. Our services businesses, Carelon and IngenioRx produced a very strong growth as we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy. IngenioRx grew revenue 11% year-over-year, while the other segment comprised primarily of Carelon, grew operating revenue 26%. Carelon and IngenioRx are delivering significant value to our Commercial and Government health plans. And consistent with our strategy, we continue to increase the breadth and depth of services Carelon is providing. Revenue eliminating consolidation, a proxy for affiliated business between our risk-based health plans and our services businesses, grew 17% year-over-year in the third quarter, representing approximately 21% of our consolidated benefit expense, up from approximately 20% a year ago. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 87.2%, a decrease of 50 basis points over the third quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we realigned certain quality improvement expenses incurred since the beginning of this year, which had a favorable impact on our benefit expense ratio and an offsetting unfavorable impact on our SG&A expense ratio with no impact on operating earnings. Excluding the impact of the accounting realignment, our benefit expense ratio would have been approximately flat year-over-year and better than our expectations. We were pleased to deliver operating margin expansion in our commercial business, driven in part by stronger medical underwriting performance in our Commercial group risk business. The successful July 1 renewal process where we repriced approximately 25% of our large group risk business and the continued increases in penetration of services into our fee-based businesses contributed to the segment's performance. We were pleased with the retention of our July 1 renewals and have even more confidence as we approach the January 1 renewal date. Elevance Health's SG&A expense ratio in the third quarter was 11.4%, an increase of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by spend to support growth and the realignment of certain quality improvement expenses as previously described. Excluding the realignment, our SG&A ratio would have improved by approximately 20 basis points year-over-year. Third quarter operating cash flow was $4.9 billion or 3.1x net income, driven primarily by the early receipt of certain fourth quarter premium revenue from CMS during the third quarter. We also paid our share of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's litigation settlement of approximately $500 million in the quarter. Excluding both of these items, operating cash flow would have been $3 billion or 1.9x net income, another indication of high quality earnings. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39.7% in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock for $579 million. Year-to-date, we've been opportunistic with respect to share repurchases during periods of volatility in our share price and have already repurchased 3.7 million shares for $1.7 billion, exceeding our initial outlook of repurchasing at least $1.5 billion in 2022. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days in claims payable stood at 47.7 days at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of 0.1 days sequentially but an increase of 0.9 days year-over-year. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year earnings outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $28.95, implying growth of approximately 15% of the adjusted baseline of $25.20 provided at the beginning of the year. Our businesses are continuing to perform well with strong momentum that we expect will carry into 2023. While we will not provide specific guidance for 2023 on this call, I would like to review some known tailwinds and headwinds worth considering as we continue planning for 2023. Starting with the tailwinds, the continued execution of our commercial margin recovery in 2023 through disciplined underwriting to cover our forward view of medical cost trends, enhanced operating efficiencies and ongoing strategies to improve the productivity and profitability of our commercial fee-based business. The growth we anticipate in our individual ACA and employer-sponsored membership as consumers transition coverage when Medicaid eligibility redeterminations resume. We expect strong earnings growth in Medicare Advantage driven by membership growth in excess of the broader market and operating margin expansion that we expect will be driven by three primary factors. Number one, having 73% of our Medicare Advantage members in four-star or higher-rated plans for the 2023 payment year, an increase of 15 percentage points year-over-year. Number two, the continued recovery and risk adjustment as utilization has returned to more normalized levels. And number three, a relatively strong funding environment for the overall industry in 2023. Finally, we expect ongoing momentum in Carelon services and IngenioRx, which will carry into next year. Our tailwinds will be weighed against one known headwind, and that is the membership attrition and related impacts on our Medicaid business is eligibility redeterminations are conducted over the course of the next year. Although interest rates continue to rise rapidly, investment income is not expected to be a material tailwind or headwind. In 2022, we enjoyed significant outperformance in our alternative investments in the first half of the year. Rising interest rates are expected to benefit the second half, and we are anticipating a full year of benefit from higher rates in 2023. While performance in both years is expected to be strong overall, I would not call out investment income as a material tailwind or headwind for either 2023 or 2022 at this point. We're also mindful of the uncertain economic environment and the risk that business conditions could deteriorate. While the balance and resilience of our enterprise and the momentum we have across our businesses leaves us well-positioned for growth in the coming years, a more severe recession could create challenges. Our associates are prepared to adapt to any change in the business environment with detailed plans that ensure we will remain positioned to meet the unique needs of our clients and customers as they evolve with a commitment to affordability and value throughout. Accordingly, at this point in time, we expect to produce another year of growth in adjusted earnings per share in line with our long-term target compound annual growth rate in 2023, which is consistent with the current consensus estimate. We look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. In closing, we continue to execute against the strategic priorities we mapped out at our 2021 Investor Conference and are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter while also continuing to reinvest in our business, better positioning us to deliver strong growth for years to come. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. No, thank you for the question, and maybe I'll start out and then turn it over to Morgan Kendrick to fine-tune some of the comments on retention. But in terms of the pacing, as I had stated 90 days ago, we expect that 300 basis points is a 2025 target, and it will be a little bit more heavily weighted to the beginning half of the time frame. So as you know, we just re-priced about 25% of our large group fully insured business here on July 1. We're going to reprice about 50% of that business on January 1. The other 25% goes throughout the year. Obviously, it's going to take a couple of years for that to get to the point where it needs to get to. And then the \u2013 really, the really nice trajectory and improvement we're having on upselling our fee-based businesses, our 5:1 to 3:1 strategy, it's going very much accordance to our expectations and the plans that we laid out, which actually do have us going through 2025. So I think the short answer to your question is a lot more of the improvements early on, but we will take till 2025 to get there. With that, Morgan? Thank you for the question, A.J. So, our Government Business division is actually performing very well. And for the year, we're certainly going to be posting some very strong results. Both Medicaid and Medicare have been growing nicely. And I think that's evidenced by the excellent top line growth we've seen of over 13% year-over-year. Medicaid's performance is strong, but for Medicaid, and we've said this in the past, on a quarterly basis, results can be a bit more variable and susceptible to swings. And when viewed in isolation, any one quarter could be misleading. Medicare is continue to perform consistent with our expectations and, as you know, has significant upside for 2023. If you think about Medicare and the improving star ratings that I talked about in my prepared comments, the more complete and accurate risk scoring that will allow us to enhance the revenue in those areas. We feel very well positioned for the future of our Medicare Advantage book. And in terms of 2023 growth, it is premature to provide specifics associated with 2023 growth. But our goal is to clearly grow faster than the industry. And we have done that on a percentage basis now for the last several years in a row and expect to do that for the next several years ongoing. So thank you for the question, A.J. Thank you for the questions, Nathan. So let me do the easy one first and that was the accounting adjustment. So during the third quarter, CMS provided clarifying guidance on the types of cost that can be included in the quality improvement cost and therefore, considered benefit expense versus those that need to be classified as SG&A. In our GAAP presentations have historically always mirrored the CMS definitions and requirements. So when CMS clarified those definitions, we realigned our reporting accordingly. And so just to be clear, the impact for the third quarter was to improve MOR by about a 0.5%, which would then make the negative impact on SG&A about 0.5% with no impact on the bottom line, clearly a reclass. For the full year, there will be about a 20 basis point impact on each of those. And then in terms, and we always, always try to be fully transparent. So, we wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the nuances in this reporting and what we will see by the end of the year of about a 20 basis point benefit to MLR for this clarification that CMS provided that we aligned with. So hopefully that helped from that perspective. And then in terms of the of the trends and costs and utilization in general, as you've stated, you pointed out without the reclassification, our MLR would've been flat, which is actually a nice improvement because of a mix on a mix adjusted basis. Since our government membership now is a higher percent of our fully insured membership than it was a year ago. So third quarter did come in better than expected, but the overall cost structure of the health system is still a bit higher than what it would've been had COVID never occurred. But I think the most important element of all this is that our trends continue to be in line with our expectations in each of our lines of businesses. So, associated with lines of businesses, Medicaid is doing slightly better than historical levels. Medicare is very much in line. We're seeing outpatient a bit higher and inpatient a bit lower, helping offset to have a more normalized trend. And then commercial has been very consistent with our last several quarters where outpatient continues to be higher, but even more so than the benefit that we're seeing in inpatient. And so that's been all part of the process and all part of the guidance. So, we're obviously not going to comment on 2023 at this point in time, but hopefully that answers all your questions. Yes. Thank you, Gary. I'll answer the first part of your question, then turn it over Felicia for your second question. But in terms of the impact on rebates, it was de-minimus. The vast majority of the reclassification impact that the commercial line of business and while we do have occasional MLR rebates in commercial, they're not nearly as prevalent as they are in some of our, in Medicaid at this point in time. So there was really de-minimus that's why I said there's virtually no bottom line impact. Felicia?"

            "content": "Thanks, John, and thanks for the question, Justin. As John said, this is going to be \u2013 it's going to take a bit to get it completely turned. July came in actually as expected. Certainly, there was some attrition in the large group risk business. To give you some concept there as it relate \u2013 context here as it relates to January, John said about 50% of that business is up for renewal. We have just released those in market. So it's a bit early to tell, but our expectations are that there will be some attrition, which is \u2013 would be natural when we're right pricing this business and we're unmoved by anything being different than expected as we move forward. Right, and thanks, Gail. And thanks Lisa for the question. When you think about the commercial group business, you've got generational cohorts, four of them with Boomers X, Y and Z that are part of the actual the makeup. And of course the way they engage certainly is indeed different. Various modalities are very important to us. And as such, we have products that we are launching that have a virtual first component where one can elect a primary care physician that would be a digital connection as opposed to a physical connection. But it also allows for the opportunity to move into the physical world within the value-based constructs that Gail described in our value-based network strategies to keep a tight closed loop integration, so to speak, on how this works. One in particular that we've already launched for January versus in our Nevada market, which is a combination of a partnership with a single entity, but layered with a digital fresh first front end. The economics of that arrangement are quite attractive in the market, and we're expecting nice pull through is the enrollment period concludes. But this is the beginning of it. We've been adding the virtual components to all of our commercial self-funded business and risk business over the past year and a half. And as such, we'll continue to build products anchored around those assets. Thanks again for the question. Thanks Dave. To \u2013 express confidence, I think that July played out as we indicated exactly as we expected. The renewals that we needed we obtained, and of course there was some attrition in the book that was certainly planned, that same phenomenon we're seeing and in we're the very beginnings of it for January 1. I think the confidence that was alluded to earlier is in the actual position in which we're pricing the business. We sort of got in the spot last year, pricing early for 2021 or 2022 and then things reveal differently in the fall. That's sort of shaping up as planned as we see right now. So the confidence in the numbers, in the market are there. When we think about this concept of a catchers met with Medicaid redetermination, there's business that stays on the Medicaid side. There's business that's going to move to the commercial side, be it group or individual. Gail alluded to the fact that we've done a really nice job in expanding our footprint to cover roughly 95% of the population of the geographies we serve \u2013 from a commercial individual ACA perspective. And then, we have very strong penetration in the commercial risk and non-risk business would also be part of that catchers met, so to speak for the group side. So all in we're confident in A the results from July B how we're [Technical Difficulty]."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carillon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another strong quarter. In the second quarter, GAAP earnings per share was $6.79, and we grew adjusted earnings per share over 14% to $8.04. Based on our results in the first half of the year and the momentum in our business, we've increased our full year adjusted earnings guidance to greater than $28.70 per share, representing growth of at least 13.9% off of the adjusted baseline we provided at the beginning of the year. Before we discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to spend a moment on our recent name change and rebranding strategy. We officially changed our holding company name to Elevance Health on June 28, having secured shareholder approval in May and are now trading under the new ticker symbol, ELV. This marks the culmination of a multiyear journey in which we have transformed from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime trusted health partner, addressing the physical, behavioral and social drivers that we know are critical to achieving optimal health. Elevance Health captures the fact that we are now much more than a health insurance company and reinforces our commitment to elevating the importance of whole health and advancing health beyond health care for our consumers, their families and communities. Last month, we also announced the launch of our new health care services brand, Carillon, and the health plan brand, WellPoint, which joined the company's family of brands that include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Our simplified brand architecture will streamline our brand portfolio, reduce complexities, and reinforce our evolution as an organization delivering solutions beyond health insurance. Grounded in our mission and fueled by our bold and ambitious purpose to improve the health of humanity, Elevance Health reflects our position as a health leader. Strong growth in all of our businesses continued in the second quarter, demonstrating that our employer, consumer and state partners are universally looking for whole health solutions that address underlying drivers of cost, while enhancing the consumer experience. Our strategies and investments in these areas are propelling strong organic membership growth, in addition to creating opportunities to scale our services division. Medical membership grew 6% year-over-year to 47.1 million members, maintaining Elevance Health's position as the largest insurer by U.S. medical membership. Over the past year, we've added more than 2.7 million net new members, including over 1.5 million net new government members and nearly 1.2 million net new commercial members. In Medicaid, the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and our industry leading RFP win rate continues to drive organic growth, which we continue to supplement through programmatic health plan acquisitions consistent with our strategy. In the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of Integra Managed Care, a Medicaid plan in New York focused on patients in need of long-term support services to help them live in their homes and communities. We're excited to welcome the Integra team to the Elevance Health family. Their commitment to patients with complex and chronic needs is well-aligned with our focus on serving the needs of the people who need us most. In Medicare Advantage, personalized health solutions are resonating with seniors, notably dual eligible members with complex and chronic needs and our supplemental benefits, which emphasize social drivers of health, supporting members with in-home support, transportation needs, healthy groceries, assisted devices and more, continue to gain traction. We remain on track to produce double-digit organic growth in our individual MA business, led by growth in duals, and are excited about our plans for 2023. In the employer market, our share gains are being driven by our leading cost-of-care position and innovative solutions focused on consumer experience and engagement. Employers have come to expect more, and we're investing to meet their needs. Today, we have strong traction in our total health connection's fleet of advocacy solutions that serves 3.9 million members, representing a 33% year-over-year increase. The programs guide members to the next step in care through a simple, intuitive and personalized experience. We leverage real-time data analytics to identify health risks so their advocates can personally connect with members to proactively facilitate preventive and, at times, responsive care. Our commitment to whole health solutions extends to our care providers, where we continue to advance value-based care and are increasingly looking to integrate health equity and social drivers of health measures into our contracts. The early indicators we are seeing in Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses demonstrate that value-based care delivers higher quality care and greater affordability. In fact, our value-based providers are helping us achieve significantly higher quality scores for impacted plans, including an 8-point improvement in quality compliance measures for Commercial members and value-based arrangements. In addition, our value-based provider partners are conducting 12% more annual wellness visits with our members on average and delivering lower overall costs for our Commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid members, with 19% lower emergency cases per 1,000 for members and value-based arrangements, compared to those not and 15% lower inpatient admissions. With the highest local concentration of membership of any health insurer, we're taking a market-by-market approach to our provider strategy to accelerate value-based care. Our local market density is unique and a valuable strategic advantage that provides optionality, allowing us to balance partnerships and investments in certain care models and geographies with select ownership through Carelon in markets where we see opportunity. We do not believe a single primary care model will prove superior for all populations and markets over time, and we are committed to a thoughtful approach that considers the structure of care delivery in our local markets and our membership density across lines of business, notably with respect to complex and chronic members. With our deep roots in our communities, we're continuing to leverage our proprietary Whole Health Index, a dynamic model tracking the health of our communities across local, social and clinical drivers. We're increasingly using the tool to measure our impact on the health of our communities and to identify and better address local, social and physical drivers of health with an emphasis on health equity and members who need us most. We've leveraged the tool to identify at-risk or equity-challenged member populations across Medicare, Dual Special Needs plans, Medicaid and our Commercial exchange-based populations and we're working with community-based partners to coordinate engagement, outreach and support, bridging physical, behavioral and social services. In practice, we're reimagining the ecosystem of care delivery for our most vulnerable members with plans to scale learnings for even greater member impact in care coordination overtime. We're privileged to be in a position to positively impact our members' lives, especially in light of the challenges faced since the beginning of the pandemic. In addition to helping us achieve our purpose as an organization, to improve the health of humanity, we're confident that our efforts are being recognized through our industry-leading Medicaid RFP track record. Core to our enterprise-wide focus on Whole Health, we also continue to accelerate our service and capabilities business through Carelon to connect people to accessible, affordable and integrated care with focus on those with complex needs. The top priority for Carelon today is to work in concert with our health plans to develop offerings that drive differentiated value for the 47 million medical members we serve, including more than 20 million fully insured members and the more than 118 million consumers we support across Elevance Health. Partnering with owned and aligned providers, our near-term focus is driving greater affordability and quality outcomes by providing the right care in the right settings, such as enabling care in the home or more effectively managing specialty pharmacy. As an example, myNEXUS, with its deep experience in managing home-based care, recently launched a new post-acute care product serving our Medicare Health Plan in Indiana via a capitated risk-sharing arrangement. Enabling providers with better technology and tools, myNEXUS will help optimize appropriate levels of care post inpatient discharge, delivering a much better patient and provider experience while having a positive impact on our health plans and driving growth for Carelon. Over the next six to 12 months, we expect to scale the post-acute care product to all of Elevance Health Medicare markets. For more than 30 years, we've been recognized as a leader in behavioral health management, an area that is a major driver of healthcare cost today and a critical component of whole person health. We manage behavioral health benefits inside of Carelon for more than 40 million consumers. And our expertise in this space was reinforced recently when Beacon, a Caroline Company, was awarded a contract to participate in the operation of the new 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The launch of 988 is a game-changing shift in how mental health services are accessed in our country, and we're proud to be part of this historic milestone. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world. In fact, environmental, social and governance frameworks are integral to our enterprise strategy. And we understand the connection to long-term business success. Accordingly, we continue to invest in key areas such as health equity, greenhouse gas mitigation and community health as part of our ESG practices. We're also proud to be an initial signatory to the healthcare sector climate pledge focused on achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We are confident in our organization's ability to adapt and to achieve our pledge, having met our goal of powering all of our operations with 100% renewable electricity earlier this year, four years ahead of schedule. We're proud that these efforts have been recognized externally. Elevance Health was recently named to Points of Light 2022 List of the Civic 50, a national standard for corporate citizenship. Just 100 ranked our organization first among healthcare providers for just business behavior. And we are the highest rated managed healthcare company by ISS and Sustainalytics, including a perfect quality score from ISS. In closing, I'd like to thank our nearly 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members we are privileged to serve. Our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering, and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.79 and adjusted earnings per share of $8.04, reflecting growth of more than 14% year-over-year. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy. Our results exceeded our expectations. And with momentum in all of our businesses and confidence in our growth trajectory, we have increased our full year earnings per share outlook. We ended the second quarter with 47.1 million members, up 2.7 million or 6.1% year-over-year, including growth of 276,000 members in the second quarter. We grew enrollment year-over-year in each of our benefit businesses with approximately 90% of our membership growth being organic, supplemented by the acquisitions of the Paramount and Integra Health Plans, which added 255,000 members and 43,000 Medicaid members in the first and second quarters of this year, and together strengthened our footprint in two attractive existing markets. Second quarter operating revenue of $38.5 billion increased $5.2 billion or approximately 16% over the prior year quarter, with strong growth in each of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid, Medicare and Commercial; premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends; the acquisitions of Paramount and Integra; and the timing of the MMM acquisition, which closed at the end of the second quarter in the prior year. Our services businesses, Carelon and IngenioRx, produced very strong growth. IngenioRx revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while the other segment revenue, comprised primarily of Carelon, grew operating revenue 31%. The strong performance in our services businesses is being driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy to work side-by-side with our health plans, the scale services that drive differentiated value for consumers, beginning with the more than 47 million medical members, which includes the more than 20 million that are fully insured, for whom we can more quickly roll out new capabilities. Beyond helping to improve our members' lives and reducing health care costs across the system, the growth of Carelon and IngenioRx are aiding diversification of Elevance Health's businesses and producing cash flow in noninsurance and therefore, nonregulated entities. Revenue eliminated in consolidation, a proxy for business between Carelon and IngenioRx and our own risk-based health plans grew 24% year-over-year in the second quarter and represented 21.8% of the consolidated benefit expense, up from 20.5% a year ago. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the second quarter was 87%, an increase of 20 basis points over the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the shift in mix business towards government programs, which carry higher medical loss ratios relative to the Commercial business. The overall medical cost insurance businesses remained higher than what we consider to be a normalized level had the pandemic never happened, with Commercial furnace above, Medicare near normal cost levels, and Medicaid still somewhat below. However, medical costs in the quarter were slightly favorable to our expectations. We expect the cost structure for health plans to remain somewhat elevated in the back half of the year, which is reflected in our guidance. Elevance Health's SG&A ratio in the second quarter was 11.1% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 40 basis points over the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher investments to support our growth. Second quarter operating cash flow was $2.5 billion or 1.5 times net income, which includes the impact of higher working capital in relation to certain provider pass-through payments in one of our Medicaid states that we anticipate will be paid in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, we also continued to expect to pay $500 million, which is our share of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's litigation settlement. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39.7%, in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for $624 million. Year-to-date, we've been opportunistic with respect to share repurchases during periods of volatility in our stock and have already repurchased 2.5 million shares for $1.2 billion. Our full year outlook of $1.5 billion is, however, still an appropriate figure for full year modeling purposes. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 47.8 days at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 0.9 days sequentially and a decrease of 0.3 days year-over-year. ECPs would have been 46 days, excluding the timing of certain provider pass-through payments that we will anticipate in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, DCPs were elevated by 1.6 days in the second quarter last year due to the timing of acquisitions. Normalizing for timing-related impacts, DCPs are very consistent on a year-over-year basis. Given stronger-than-expected performance year-to-date and the continued momentum in each of our businesses, we are increasing our full year earnings outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $28.70, implying growth of approximately 14% off of the adjusted baseline of $25.20 provided at the beginning of the year. In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter, our first reported as Elevance Health. In my 28 years with the company, this is easily the most prepared and well-balanced our enterprise has been as we look into the future. Strong underlying fundamentals, coupled with our balanced and diverse set of businesses, gives me confidence in our ability to deliver another strong year of growth in 2022, regardless of how the macroeconomic environment evolves. The diversification of our enterprise and the resilience that provides is an extremely valuable asset. Consider that in 2021, operating revenue of our Commercial and Specialty businesses represented just 25% of our total gross operating revenue, down from nearly 70% in 2008. And for the first time last year, operating earnings in our government business exceeded operating earnings in our commercial business. It is no coincidence that we have produced strong growth for our enterprise in both good and bad times for the broader economy in recent years. Simply put, we are well-prepared to meet the needs of our clients should they evolve in response to a more challenged business environment. Today, the momentum in each of our businesses, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy, coupled with the diversity of our businesses, positions us uniquely well. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just maybe drill down a little more on the comments around the commercial business. I know the commercial operating margin dipped year-to-year to 7.6%. And I wondered, it sounds like you're seeing elevated utilization there. Is that something that you just think is temporary? Will that correct itself? And are you moving toward making pricing adjustments for 2023 on that? Or is this sort of the run rate to go forward with?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, A.J. I think as you think about our commercial business, there's a couple -- like I want to parse out a little bit of what you're seeing in that business, because I think it's important to first look at the entire business. One, we've had strong and consistent growth and feel pretty good -- very good about our business in the last few years. And there's two elements. One is obviously the risk-based business and the other fee-based business. I'm going to start with the fee based, and I'll address your question directly on risk base. In terms of the fee-based business, we're making really good progress on the strategy around margin improvement. And as we've laid out on the five to one to three to one strategy, and we continue to grow our fee-based business, I think, at an industry leading rate. And just a couple of, I think, proof points that help show that even inside of the totality of the business, our fee revenue grew 7.9% year-over-year, and then if you just look at it sequentially, 7.3% for the six months ending June 30th, which shows that acceleration of growth that we've been talking about. And you compare that to our membership, which grew about 3.4% year-over-year. So clearly, there is really good improvement. And I think we're very much on the progression that we described at our Investor Day to improve our revenue for fee-based members. Turning to the operating margin, more in our risk-based business. As I've shared before, that does remain challenged by COVID, and that really is what we believe to be the most significant issue, and we do think it's transitory. We do expect our margins to recover to the pre-pandemic levels and are taking actions to do that. You saw an improvement overall from first to second quarter. But again, this has to pace through as we do renewals. The last thing I would say is, we also know we've been in this pandemic now for several years. COVID is not going to zero. Ultimately, as we think about our pricing in the commercial market, we're not changing anything about the approach or philosophy that we've used historically, we're always pricing to our forward view of costs. If you look at this year, COVID hit at a time high in January and February. So, as we look to forward pricing, we're looking around all of our costs and now, I think, have a much better perspective on projection of what those costs should be. And so, you'll see ratable improvement over the course. And maybe I'll ask John to just talk about your question on utilization a little bit. John?\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, and good morning A.J., and associated with utilization, in our first quarter call, I think we were very clear that the Omicron surge in January was most significant to the commercial market. And so that obviously has a direct impact on the commercial margins. And even as we go through the full six months and project out for the rest of 2022, we do believe that commercial will have a cost structure, when you add COVID and non-COVID combined, to be in excess of baseline -- above baseline actually each quarter for the year. Medicare is going to be close to baseline. And Medicaid, we expect to be a bit below baseline. Overall, the entire company above baseline for the rest of the year. So clearly, those cost structures being directed more towards the commercial marketplace have a direct impact on the commercial margins that you're seeing. And as Gail said, we do believe that they're transitory, and that we will price the forward trend for the future. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks, good morning. If I could just follow up on A.J.'s question first. You have a 2025 margin target, I think, in the Commercial business of 11% out there. Let's say, you do close to 8% this year, do you still take 11% a reasonable target for 2025? And if so, how do you think the pace of kind of getting there is over the next three years? And then my question would just be, can you give us an update on the City of New York contract? Looks like you pulled out of that, can you give us some background on how that affects numbers? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Justin. Let me address your first question. We have not changed our 2025 perspective in the short run, different impacts that we didn't obviously have at the time we gave that, but we haven't changed anything about our 2025 overall margin perspective across the businesses that we shared. So, I just want to be really clear about that. In terms of your second question, the City of New York contract, a couple of things on that. One, when we originally bid on this contract, it was set to go live in January 1 of this year. But as you know, and we've shared on this call, due to litigation, that go-live date has been delayed several times now. Based on the fact that we've been on in the active litigation, we had asked the City for some certainty around exactly what the benefits would be. And also, quite frankly, Medicare Advantage contracts take a lot of work to put up, and we want to make sure that the members were best served. We've served these members for a long time, and we needed greater certainty. So we did not feel, based on the inability of what's going on with the litigation as well as being prepared, that we could go forward with the contract. And then notably, the City remains one of our very important customers, and we continue to serve those clients on a fee-based business. So that's where we stand on the city in New York. Thanks very much for the question, though. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Could you talk a little bit about the Carelon business. And in particular, I'm interested in as you look at penetration in the fully insured and the self-insured business, what is the current status of kind of product penetration there? And what are the biggest opportunities for you as you drive that forward?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Lance. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon, please address that. Pete?\nPeter Haytaian: Thanks, Lance. Appreciate the question. First of all, we're really pleased with our progress and performance in Carelon so far from a growth and operating perspective as we build up the services business. Overall, Q2 is in line with the improvements we expected. I'm really pleased with the performance improvements across all the verticals. As we've discussed before, Lance, one of our main focal points is really driving more capitation and risk through Carelon. So as it relates to progress, we're really executing on that strategy with strength. So from a cross-selling perspective, we've played that through in Beacon, in AIM and with myNEXUS. As we talked about with AIM, we just finalized capitating a lot of the services this year starting last year. We're also executing on our strategy associated with growth, and I'm really excited about the innovation that's occurring. Gail mentioned in her remarks, a really great example is the rollout of a post-acute care offering being myNEXUS indexes. This is a great example of penetrating our business to a greater degree. I think you've heard me talk about this before, but one of the things we're trying to do is naturally extend our offerings and penetrate our business to a greater degree. And that's exactly what the supposed acute care offering is. We're taking the tools, technology and capabilities of myNEXUS, and we're utilizing that with a new offering to penetrate the Medicare business in a much more broad way. So I'm really thrilled with the progress. You'll continue to see that. I think the opportunities are vast in terms of further penetration.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Pete, and thanks for the question, Lance. And I think, as Pete shared, we're excited about this business. It's an important strategic lever for us. But importantly, it's really early innings. And the examples that I shared in my early -- earlier comments to show that we can begin to implement this in certain markets, get experience on it on a risk basis and then roll it out to the rest of our 20 million-plus risk-based members and 47 million total. So lot of opportunity for us, but we also want to make sure we execute this with precision and benefit both our health plans as well as Carelon. So, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nCal Sternick: Yes, good morning. This is Cal Sternick on for Lisa. A quick question on the Medicaid redeterminations. So what are you assuming for timing on when those will resume? And I know you've previously talked about retaining about a one-third of the members you added during the public health emergency period. Does that still seem like the right target in your view?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to please address that. Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Good morning and thank you for the question. As you know, the PHE was recently extended to October 13. So it follows that we are going to have Medicaid attrition related to redetermination that could begin as early as November. However, I would say, given back-to-school, it's also possible that COVID prevalence could rise around the September, October time frame or that the population might need boosters or other vaccines. So at this point, it's really simply too early to predict, but it's certainly possible that we could have a PHE extension into January of 2023. If there is another extension into January of 2023, that could lead to Medicaid attrition starting right around the February time frame. So redeterminations would then commence over what would be 14 months, given guidance from CMS that ask states to have up to 14 months to redetermine members and not redetermine more than one night of that membership in a single month. As we think about where we are, you should keep in mind that we operate obviously in 14 Blue states. And our Medicaid membership -- our total Medicaid membership, I'll say, has grown significantly across that platform. So as we think about where we are today, we are going to continue to work very closely with our commercial colleagues to make sure that we have in place a process for looking very thoughtfully market by market and having a view of the competitive dynamics in those markets and capture as much as we can inside of the Anthem 14 Blue states, where we will be offering ACA plans in nearly every county in 2023. So as we sit here today, we gave that early numbers, certainly with respect to 35% of that membership staying within Medicaid, another 45% or so going into Commercial plans, about 15% on the exchanges and 5% in uninsured, but the macro environment certainly has changed tremendously. What we'll say is that, we are positioned very well to navigate through the end of this PHE and the return of redeterminations when that happens, based on a very balanced portfolio here at Anthem, Elevance Health, I should say. And certainly, we'll continue to work closely with our Commercial colleagues to make sure that our members have access to care, continuity of coverage and can really navigate this landscape when redeterminations begin.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Felicia. I just want to reiterate one point, I think, that's really important that Felicia made, which she and John have said many times, which is the balanced portfolio that we have across Elevance Health. And one of the statistics that I think really brings at home is there's been more than 6 million Medicaid entrants as part of not doing redeterminations in our 14 Blue states. And we have significantly, regardless of the percentage you look at in our commercial business, have coverage now in nearly every county on our individual exchanges. So we've been planning for this. We're preparing for it across our businesses and feel very well prepared to manage that. And again, obviously, CMS has given the guidance to take up to 14 months and not determine more than one night at a month. So again, thank you very much for the question. But overall, we feel that we've got very good coverage. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO. Please, go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: Yes. Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about, as you pull these pieces together or have pulled them together for Carelon, how are you thinking about home health? And I mentioned that in the context that, of course, an acquisition of a home health company by one of your largest competitors and also the issues in the home health area with the shortage of nurses and so forth, and how you're grappling with that, frankly, in the current environment?\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Pete, would you like to address that, please?\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Matt. Home Care is a space we're really interested in. Our focus with Carelon, as we've talked about, is on complex patients. We've talked about being on the right side of health care, giving patients access to services in the most appropriate setting. And certainly, home is a critical component in that regard. I think when you look at our acquisition of MyNEXUS, which closed last year, and its focused on the home through utilization management tools and capabilities and partnering with a very vast network of providers, we have nine of the top 10 nationally to drive the most appropriate level of services in the home is a good example. Another example in terms of how we're penetrating the home today is through Aspire. It's a national leading company in the delivery of palliative care services. So, I'd say strategically, in the short-term, I mentioned this before, we've been looking actively for natural extension opportunities with regard to the assets we have. And again, a great example of that is the post-acute care launch that we just mentioned. We also launched most recently, as it relates to the home, the delivery of social determinants of health and star services via those capabilities. On a longer term basis, in terms of your question, we really -- we do continue to evaluate further opportunities in terms of direct care that can be provided in the home and delivering that value to all our Elevance Health plans and ensuring patients get the right level of care. And we are very sensitive to your last point about the labor issues. It's been interesting, but a lot of the companies that we've been partnering with have been able to effectively navigate some of the labor issues as it relates to home in terms of our members getting critical care. So, that's a good thing right now in the short term.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the commercial selling season for 2023, you're obviously coming off a very strong national account selling season for 2022. Could you talk about maybe how those conversations have progressed for the upcoming year? And have there been any changes in the nature of those conversations just given the macro backdrop? And has that changed the opportunity to sell in services like pharmacy or stop loss or others? Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question. I'll have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our Commercial and Specialty Business, to address that. Morgan?\nMorgan Kendrick: Hey Nathan, thank you for the question. Yes, it's -- the business is cyclical. Typically, these cases renew on a 36 or 60-month cycle. So, you think about the very large year we had for the 2022 cycle, 2023 is down from that, and that's expected. There were a number of jumbos last year. What we're seeing notably, which is consistent with last year, is a number of cases going out for single vendor opportunities. That hasn't changed and what we've seen this year, albeit we have seen the dampening in the large jumbo cases in our geographies. But the conversations are consistent. You can certainly imagine, you alluded to the fact that we've got a talent challenge. And employers have shifted this concept to more of a human capital strategy and how they actually think about their benefits differently in attracting, retaining talent. So, that's been a big piece of it. At the end of the day, the conversations are generally focused around two things: number one, economics; number two, experience. When we think about the assets that we deliver from a network perspective, nationally, we score very well. Also, when you think about how we think about the experience component, Gail mentioned earlier our total Health Connection suite of services up 33%, with nearly 4 million of our commercial members. That's almost half of our commercial business is using that service. We think that's going to crescendo. So, we feel confident in it. Certainly, it's a smaller sales cycle. We're seeing that across the country. It's not notable to any geography, but we are seeing wins where we're seeing consolidation, and we're having -- we're starting to get the answers for the one-ones, they're affirmative, and we feel really good. Thanks again for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, thanks. I'm going to have Pete address your pharmacy penetration question. Pete?\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. No, thanks for that. And working very closely with Morgan, this is a critical issue for us as we've talked about in terms of penetrating the Elevance book of business and our ASO business. And we continue to get really strong feedback from the distribution community regarding a lot of our solutions. Our pricing is coming in line. Many of our offerings, like our specialty cost relief program, our enhanced specialty condition management programs are really gaining legs as well as the way we're bundling offerings. How this is playing out in the market is a really good results and improvement year-over-year. We've experienced a 300% improvement year-over-year, year-to-date in terms of the total numbers sold. And importantly, I want to emphasize at this point, we're seeing a lot of growth in the middle market and down market, less than 10,000 members. It's a really nice sweet spot for us. It's where Morgan and the Commercial business do very, very well. And our margin profile is very strong as well as it really plays through on the integrated value proposition, and that is a big contributor to the five to one to three to one that we've talked about historically.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Pete. I think what you heard from both Morgan and Pete is really, we're very pleased that we're winning in the most sophisticated and discerning segment of the market, and that really plays across all of our customers. So thanks very much for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead. Mr. Taylor, your line is open.\nGary Taylor: Can you hear me now?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes, we can hear you, Gary.\nGary Taylor: Okay, great. Sorry. I just want to come back to Commercial operating income a little bit, obviously, you had growth -- modest growth this quarter. COVID still impacting it. I think earlier in the year, you had talked about some of the extreme quarterly seasonality in Commercial OI easing a bit this year, which would imply that Commercial OI growth in the second half will continue to look better. Just want to make sure that's still your expectation. And particularly with -- just in the early months of July, we are seeing COVID hospitalizations picking up again. Is it still your expectation that that Commercial OI growth can improve from what we've seen in the first half?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the question, Gary and good morning. Associated with the seasonality, I'll just clarify for everyone on the line of what we talked about during the first quarter was that there are many of the services that Carelon offers are being sold to Commercial on a capitated rate basis. And so the seasonality that historically would have been in Commercial associated with those services is now going to be in our Carelon segment and Commercial will have less seasonality. So yes, that is still playing out exactly as we talked about 90 days ago, and that will continue to be part of the quarterly cadence for both of those entities over time. And then associated with the overall cost structure. As I had said, I think in A.J.'s question, we are expecting the commercial cost structure for COVID and non-COVID combined to be above baseline again in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, which obviously puts pressure on the overall margins. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. And that, again, as John said, very consistent with the expectations that we've always had. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask about just for an update on the marketplace business, and if you can talk about how marketplace margins have been performing year-to-date relative to plan. Then also just some initial insights on how you're thinking about the pricing environment for the exchanges in 2023. Obviously, a lot of different moving pieces to pricing as there always seems to be in this business, but does seem that at least some of the most, let's call it, aggressive actors in the market have started to file for some firming rate increases. So, just interested in your perspectives on how pricing is looking for the exchanges next year? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Let me ask Morgan Kendrick to comment on that. Please, Morgan?\nMorgan Kendrick: Yes, Scott. Thanks for the question. Generally, your question is around how we think about the '23 pricing. Again, we've noted we really like this business. There's a great opportunity. Our margins are performing as expected, quite honestly, for '22. We're just now pricing '23. We're in the middle of that cycle. Your point is spot on, that there's always an actor that's looking to take aggressive share in aggressive pricing points in each geography. We are seeing some firming, but there's always a new actor that wants to come into the mix, so to speak. It is a competitive market, but we continue to look at this as an expanding opportunity. As Gail alluded to and Felicia alluded to, when we think about the Medicaid redetermination, we are now in north of 95% of the counties in the geographies that we serve. So, we feel strongly about it. We're taking prudent, normal pricing actions. Nothing's changed in our pricing strategy. We're pricing to the forward view of trend with all of -- in modifying for all of the challenges that are currently facing in the business or in the economies. That said, we expect it to be expanding. We've been notified some expansions in some of our largest geographies. We know that we look good in those geographies. So, over the next 60 days through -- 60 to 90 days, we will firm up the position. But right now, we feel quite good about it.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And thanks, Morgan. I think sort of summarizing that, we feel good about this business. We've had a pretty consistent strategy. We haven't looked for outsized growth. We want to be in markets where we can be for the long term and that's why you've seen us year-over-year, expand the counties we're in as we continue to see the stability of that marketplace. So again, that business is performing along our expectations, and we expect to be in more counties. We see some opportunities, obviously, as redeterminations come in as a real catchers met for some of that. So, thanks for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning. I guess mine is really just more of a confirmatory question around some of the comments on the elevated commercial medical cost trends. I think in one part of the Q&A, you mentioned the elevated costs relate to maybe more to the exchange individual membership within Commercial. So, I just want to confirm, yes or no, is that the bigger part of what's happening? And I guess just for further clarification, yes or no, is the group risk-based commercial book of business, in particular, seeing elevated medical cost trends above the pre-COVID baseline? Just a little more color around the two subsegments within commercial risk? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Steve, for the question. So just for clarity, we have not provided any commentary associated with the difference between ACA and Group. We've talked about Commercial in total. So, I'm not exactly sure what comment that you were referring to, but it's not anything that was part of this call. And just to reiterate what I've said, we have seen overall cost structures in commercial to be elevated in excess of what a normalized baseline would have been, had COVID had never occurred. You can certainly look at the amount of membership that we have in fully insured risk versus ACA. And obviously, risk is the lion's share of the membership -- the group risk. I'm sorry, is the lion's share of the fully insured membership. So obviously, that is the primary driver. But overall, we do believe that the COVID costs are transitory. They're not going to go to zero, as Gail had said. We are going to proactively price for forward trend. But the impact that we have on our margins currently is a transitory piece of that equation. And so we feel very good about our long-term aspects. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, John. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on Medicare Advantage. I think you're targeting double-digit growth this year, rolling your way to that. Wondering if that can be -- if that can continue next year, what you're thinking about for the open enrollment and competitive landscape there and with the necessarily healthy rate for 2023. So just views on Medicare Advantage.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Felicia, would you like to address that?\nFelicia Norwood: Good morning and thank you, David. First and foremost, let me start by saying, we are pleased with how we are performing this year. We started with a very strong AEP, and that certainly has kept us on track to deliver double-digit growth in our individual MA business. You might also want to recall that most of our business continues to come in throughout the course of the year, because we have a very balanced portfolio when we look at our duals growth, and that membership comes in year round. It's too early to talk about 2023 and anything associated with double-digit growth. I will say, we expect to continue to have strong growth. We have what we believe will be very competitive products in the marketplace. Our benefit designs, which are really led with our supplemental benefit offerings as we think about whole health, continue to resonate with our consumers. And we continue to be very focused on going deeper in our markets, particularly in our Blue states. So when we think about how we are positioned today, with very nice competitive benefits, strategically, we've continued on that course as we head into to 2023. And I think we're positioned to continue to deliver strong growth. Long term, our focus and our -- certainly, our perspective on Medicare Advantage remains unchanged. This is a very attractive segment for us, strategically important with us and our Carelon services as well. And we're committed to continuing to deliver strong growth in our business.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRicky Goldwasser: Yes, hi. Good morning. So one clarifying question. You talked clearly about COVID plus non-COVID utilization being about above a baseline for the year and second half. What are you seeing for non-COVID utilization on the Commercial business? Is it in line with pre-COVID or below? And then secondly, can you comment on the sensitivity of commercial membership to potential changes in unemployment? One of your competitors talked about 50 basis points for every 100 basis point change non-employment. So just kind of like wanted to see if you have any context to give us there? And what are you hearing from your clients about their plans to manage their workforce?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Ricky, for that multipart question. Let me try to answer the first part of it, and then ask one of my partners here to reply to the other part of your question in terms of cost structure. So we have been really disclosing COVID and non-COVID combined as our total cost and not really specifying or trying to parse out the -- at least publicly, the amount that's COVID and the amount that's non-COVID. And I can tell you that non-COVID, all by itself, is a bit below baseline, even in Commercial. And then when you add COVID on top, the total of the two exceeds baseline. We have seen still ER utilization being down from pre-pandemic levels. Inpatient is actually down a bit here this year. Outpatient is actually up a little bit compared to pre-COVID levels or pre-pandemic levels. But all in, the cost structure is the cost structure, we have to cover it all, and we certainly will. So, hopefully, that gives you the clarity you need.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And to the second part of your question, I think, I caught most of it, Ricky. But I think there's a few things, one, to your how are employees thinking about their workforce. As I think we shared a little bit earlier in the call Morgan did. Now we're really seeing, kind of, employers still expanding their workforce and looking for more benefits and to maintain the strength of their workforce. So we haven't seen any pullback yet in terms of our employer populations across any of the sized segments that we serve. That's not to say that, that couldn't happen. But at this stage, it's -- as you think about the challenges in the economy, they're more inflation-based than employment-based at this stage. And employers are still looking for strong solutions. One of the things that we're offering, obviously, is affordable products. We've been continuing to enhance our product portfolio. We have a very strong cost position. Again, one of the reasons we win is, we go in with a very strong medical cost position across all those segments. So I think from that perspective, we have not seen any noticeable difference. In terms of our own book of business, if you look at our history, we've got actually -- I really can't comment on the others who've given you some numbers around what they think would happen. But our book of business has been quite resilient. As you remember, we have a very deep -- we support school districts, public service -- public services, et cetera. And so, we have a very, I think, different profile across our businesses, and our history has shown that those have had greater stickiness during both up and downtimes in the economy. So, overall, I think at this stage, we're still seeing strong interest and strong growth from the commercial sector. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Robert Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please, go ahead.\nRobert Cottrell: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on Medicaid. Given that now utilization within the Medicaid business has been running below baseline or below expectations for the past several quarters, is there any risk to states coming back to you and doing rate adjustments, given the lower-than-expected utilization?\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thanks, Rob. Very good question. I would say, first and foremost, we are always working with our state partners to ensure that we have actuarially justified rates, rates that really mirror the acuity of the population. There is one really significant item, just to make sure that we're all aware of, and that's we're in an MLR collar or MLR rebate position in many of our Medicaid states currently. So we will be refunding back to the states amounts of the premium that we've been paid here this past year or so. And as we look at what future rate actions or rate filings could do, the first thing that they will do is they will reduce the amount of the MLR rebates before we end up with our final read. But at the end of the day, we feel very good about our ability to negotiate actuarially justified rates with our state partners. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes, hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the assumptions you're making on utilization in the back half of the year and what we should think about through the MLR cadence there. So, appreciating that you're running above what you view as the baseline, but it does seem like other parts of the system view that they're below baseline, are expecting a ramp of utilization throughout the year. I guess how much of that is in your thinking for the guidance. Thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Steve, I'm not positive I can comment on what other parts of the system you're referring to without a little bit more specificity on that. But I'll just say that we track utilization very closely. We certainly understand the seasonality factors associated with utilization. I think Felicia even mentioned going back to school and things that, that might cause, and we're trying to factor all those variables in. And we actually feel very, very good about the analytics and the informatics we have associated with this information. So, we have certainly put our best thinking forward in terms of our -- in terms of the cost trends, the pricing and the guidance that we've provided. So, thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: We'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Thanks. I just wanted to go back to MyNEXUS for a second. Can you share like what percent of your MA membership is in states that you have delegated some services to MyNEXUS today? I'm just trying to think of the opportunity as you scale the partnership. And when you delegate risk, if that's what we want to call it to MyNEXUS, what are they doing with network tiering, narrowing the network when you optimize the level of care? Is that just reducing the allowable visits? I'm just trying to properly understand exactly what you're doing.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Pete, would you like to respond?\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. Let me start with what you asked about exactly what we're doing on the post-acute care launch because it's something that we're really excited about in terms of the natural extension of the capabilities we have. Today, when you think about what MyNEXUS does, we have industry-leading tools and capabilities that really allow us to efficiently manage on the UM side. And as we've talked about, partner with our network providers and then effectively manage the level and appropriateness of services in the core product, it's in the home. So, when you think about the post-acute care product, just to give you specificity on what we're doing, we're really -- we're leveraging these tools for post-acute care management upon discharge of the patient out of the inpatient setting. And then through our leading portal, again, the tools and technologies that really differentiate us, post-acute care providers are easily able to make requests for services. It creates a much more effective and efficient experience for the provider. And this enables us to be very clear upfront in terms of the most appropriate levels of post-acute care. So, when you think about that in that setting, you think about long-term acute care facilities, you think about rehabilitation facilities, you think about skilled nursing facilities. And we're managing the appropriate level of services, and then we're eventually facilitating a discharge hopefully to the home. And as we've talked about, what Carelon does is we manage that entire episode of care on a capitated basis. This builds in predictable cost-of-care for our partners and the health plans in this case, for Felicia, in the Medicare business. And if we're effective at managing that, we are driving an incremental margin for Carelon and then incremental benefit for Elevance.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Pete. I think that there's two points that I wanted to highlight from Pete's subscription. One, a core part of our strategy that we shared about Carelon is moving from a fee basis to a risk basis. And so when we acquired myNEXUS, we did have a large participation with them and knew them quite well in our Medicare business, but on a fee basis. So this is the next iteration across all of our Carelon services, where we now have, I think, much better insight and can move this to a risk basis. So that was just the beginning and why I see early innings there. And then the second thing is we see this as a huge opportunity, as you talk about network strategy, pull this through our value-based contracts and our partnerships and relationships. And again, another core part of our strategy where we see this as a very synergistic. So thanks for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAdam Ron: Hey, thanks for the question. This is Adam Ron on for Kevin. Going back to the comments about Medicaid, how should we think about maybe the impacts to margins from redeterminations? I could see two potential sources of margin compression that are pretty clear, like one is obviously just negative fixed cost leverage from losing membership. But more importantly, and I guess, complicated is the potential that healthy people are more likely to lose coverage first. So there are a risk that there would be a rate mismatch from the state for an extended period of time, it may take time to reevaluate the acuity? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, Kevin, for the question. And certainly, some of the questions you asked were may be consistent with some of the things we saw in 2019. So let me just maybe reference a little bit what's different now versus then. So in 2019, we went through a redetermination process. It worked through very quickly. And then the overall acuity of the population was a little bit higher than what the rates that had been set, well, justified. And just FYI, there were retroactive rate increases ultimately, but there was clearly a disconnect for a few quarters there in 2019, where now we have a very well thought-out process that's going to take up to 14 months that won't even begin until after the PHE expires. The other thing is, as I had mentioned in a different question, we're in an MLR collar position in virtually every Medicaid market. And so the immediate impact to any of the rates will first be to reduce the MLR collar position that we're in. In 2019, we were -- had very, very few MLR collars. But I think the most important element of all this is now part of how the pricing is done, that the -- thanks to some of the great work our teams have done, that the standard rating input now, as part of the Medicaid pricing, includes an acuity change factor. And that was not the case in 2019. That was a one-off conversation, and now it's part of the standard input into the rates for 2022. So all-in, we think we're in a significantly better position today than we were then. 2019 might be informative but it's certainly not a precedent. So we actually feel very good about our future state prospects. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Thank you very much. I just wanted to do a quick follow-up to Dave's question about the competitive backdrop for MA and duals. Clearly, supplemental benefit is a key area of competition as we go forward and this Medicare Advantage becomes more competitive. Just wanted to see if you could go into a little bit more detail about how you're differentiating your supplemental benefits and products for those members. And I think you had mentioned on the first quarter call, everyday extras. And just if you could go into more detail on that and how that's differentiating your offering? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Yes. Ben, thank you for the question. I will say that we were really early leaders in the supplemental benefit areas because of our focus on whole person health. And what everyday extras or what we call essential extras allow us to do is to allow members to really personalize the benefit that best meets their needs. All of our members are different. And at the end of the day, we think it's important that they are able to have a range of benefit offerings that either allow them to provide transportation, grocery benefits, whatever that need is from an overall Whole Health perspective. So, I think the differentiation for us lies really in the personalization. So, we've developed a range of offerings that allow members to really improve their overall health outcomes, and that gives them the flexibility to be able to decide what works best for them. So ultimately, I think that's the differentiating factor for us from a Medicare Advantage perspective. We've tried to make sure we continue with that stability as we head into 2023 and certainly give members the opportunity to make those personalized decisions that works best for them.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Felicia. And now we'll take our last question.\nOperator: For our final question will go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks for pick me in. So, with the rebranding complete, and it's been a little while since the 2021 Investor Day, could you just remind us the overall strategy at Carelon? And I'd be most interested in any areas of interest that have changed over the last 1.5 years or so and why?\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. And I'll have Pete address the Carelon strategy. But I think, what you saw certainly in our overall rebranding with Elevance Health is, our business has changed. We've been on a journey from just traditional health benefits, which are still important to us and continue to grow. And as John shared and just how our revenue has changed even over the last five years, a pretty significant shift. Carelon's a really important part of our move in the services strategy around the complex and chronic, but more importantly, that serving our captive membership already of 47 million members. So just maybe, Pete, you can talk a little bit more about how you see Carelon strategy evolving.\nPeter Haytaian: Thanks, Gail. And Gail just hit it at a high level in terms of our high-level strategies, advancing Whole Health and connecting people to accessible, affordable and integrated care. And as she said, our focus now is on the Elevance Health plans, 20 million fully insured, 47 million folks in total. And just to double-click on that, we're really focused on, on those complex populations. When you think about the spend in those complex populations on a per member per year basis, significantly higher at 12,500 for example, versus a standard average commercial number of 4,500 per member per year. And again, this creates a real wonderful springboard for us to sell externally and penetrate clients externally, especially the Blues. In addition, we talk a lot about being on the right side of health care, which, again, means providing services in the most affordable, highest-quality setting. So that's something that we're very focused on and ensuring that those are connected to the growing profit pools outside of traditional insurance. So, none of that has really changed. As you know, Josh, in terms of what we talked about historically, the verticals that we're focused on are care delivery, behavioral health, advanced analytics and services and then pharmacy. I'd say what we're very interested moving forward, I wouldn't say it's a change, but that we're very interested is a deeper interest in the home, as we've talked about, certainly, specialty pharmacy, where we're seeing trends accelerate. And we believe the opportunity is really vast to penetrate the Elevance book. And then finally, I'll close on something that we're very, very focused on and we believe could be a differentiator is how we connect with our digital organization and build a digital platform for health that really connects all these services in a cohesive and coherent way, ultimately for the patient. And that's something that we're actively working on.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Pete, and thank you to everyone for joining us and for your questions this morning. In closing, we're really pleased with the ongoing momentum in our business in 2022-to-date. And we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continuing to deliver against the financial targets that we shared with you at our investor conference last year. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11 a.m. today through August 20, 2022. You may access the replay system at any time by dialing 866-430-8797 and international participants can dial 203-369-0943. This concludes our conference for today.

            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "Thanks, Lance. Appreciate the question. First of all, we're really pleased with our progress and performance in Carelon so far from a growth and operating perspective as we build up the services business. Overall, Q2 is in line with the improvements we expected. I'm really pleased with the performance improvements across all the verticals. As we've discussed before, Lance, one of our main focal points is really driving more capitation and risk through Carelon. So as it relates to progress, we're really executing on that strategy with strength. So from a cross-selling perspective, we've played that through in Beacon, in AIM and with myNEXUS. As we talked about with AIM, we just finalized capitating a lot of the services this year starting last year. We're also executing on our strategy associated with growth, and I'm really excited about the innovation that's occurring. Gail mentioned in her remarks, a really great example is the rollout of a post-acute care offering being myNEXUS indexes. This is a great example of penetrating our business to a greater degree. I think you've heard me talk about this before, but one of the things we're trying to do is naturally extend our offerings and penetrate our business to a greater degree. And that's exactly what the supposed acute care offering is. We're taking the tools, technology and capabilities of myNEXUS, and we're utilizing that with a new offering to penetrate the Medicare business in a much more broad way. So I'm really thrilled with the progress. You'll continue to see that. I think the opportunities are vast in terms of further penetration. Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Matt. Home Care is a space we're really interested in. Our focus with Carelon, as we've talked about, is on complex patients. We've talked about being on the right side of health care, giving patients access to services in the most appropriate setting. And certainly, home is a critical component in that regard. I think when you look at our acquisition of MyNEXUS, which closed last year, and its focused on the home through utilization management tools and capabilities and partnering with a very vast network of providers, we have nine of the top 10 nationally to drive the most appropriate level of services in the home is a good example. Another example in terms of how we're penetrating the home today is through Aspire. It's a national leading company in the delivery of palliative care services. So, I'd say strategically, in the short-term, I mentioned this before, we've been looking actively for natural extension opportunities with regard to the assets we have. And again, a great example of that is the post-acute care launch that we just mentioned. We also launched most recently, as it relates to the home, the delivery of social determinants of health and star services via those capabilities. On a longer term basis, in terms of your question, we really -- we do continue to evaluate further opportunities in terms of direct care that can be provided in the home and delivering that value to all our Elevance Health plans and ensuring patients get the right level of care. And we are very sensitive to your last point about the labor issues. It's been interesting, but a lot of the companies that we've been partnering with have been able to effectively navigate some of the labor issues as it relates to home in terms of our members getting critical care. So, that's a good thing right now in the short term. Yes. No, thanks for that. And working very closely with Morgan, this is a critical issue for us as we've talked about in terms of penetrating the Elevance book of business and our ASO business. And we continue to get really strong feedback from the distribution community regarding a lot of our solutions. Our pricing is coming in line. Many of our offerings, like our specialty cost relief program, our enhanced specialty condition management programs are really gaining legs as well as the way we're bundling offerings. How this is playing out in the market is a really good results and improvement year-over-year. We've experienced a 300% improvement year-over-year, year-to-date in terms of the total numbers sold. And importantly, I want to emphasize at this point, we're seeing a lot of growth in the middle market and down market, less than 10,000 members. It's a really nice sweet spot for us. It's where Morgan and the Commercial business do very, very well. And our margin profile is very strong as well as it really plays through on the integrated value proposition, and that is a big contributor to the five to one to three to one that we've talked about historically. Yes. Let me start with what you asked about exactly what we're doing on the post-acute care launch because it's something that we're really excited about in terms of the natural extension of the capabilities we have. Today, when you think about what MyNEXUS does, we have industry-leading tools and capabilities that really allow us to efficiently manage on the UM side.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another strong quarter. In the second quarter, GAAP earnings per share was $6.79, and we grew adjusted earnings per share over 14% to $8.04. Based on our results in the first half of the year and the momentum in our business, we've increased our full year adjusted earnings guidance to greater than $28.70 per share, representing growth of at least 13.9% off of the adjusted baseline we provided at the beginning of the year. Before we discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to spend a moment on our recent name change and rebranding strategy. We officially changed our holding company name to Elevance Health on June 28, having secured shareholder approval in May and are now trading under the new ticker symbol, ELV. This marks the culmination of a multiyear journey in which we have transformed from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime trusted health partner, addressing the physical, behavioral and social drivers that we know are critical to achieving optimal health. Elevance Health captures the fact that we are now much more than a health insurance company and reinforces our commitment to elevating the importance of whole health and advancing health beyond health care for our consumers, their families and communities. Last month, we also announced the launch of our new health care services brand, Carillon, and the health plan brand, WellPoint, which joined the company's family of brands that include Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Our simplified brand architecture will streamline our brand portfolio, reduce complexities, and reinforce our evolution as an organization delivering solutions beyond health insurance. Grounded in our mission and fueled by our bold and ambitious purpose to improve the health of humanity, Elevance Health reflects our position as a health leader. Strong growth in all of our businesses continued in the second quarter, demonstrating that our employer, consumer and state partners are universally looking for whole health solutions that address underlying drivers of cost, while enhancing the consumer experience. Our strategies and investments in these areas are propelling strong organic membership growth, in addition to creating opportunities to scale our services division. Medical membership grew 6% year-over-year to 47.1 million members, maintaining Elevance Health's position as the largest insurer by U.S. medical membership. Over the past year, we've added more than 2.7 million net new members, including over 1.5 million net new government members and nearly 1.2 million net new commercial members. In Medicaid, the ongoing suspension of eligibility redeterminations and our industry leading RFP win rate continues to drive organic growth, which we continue to supplement through programmatic health plan acquisitions consistent with our strategy. In the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of Integra Managed Care, a Medicaid plan in New York focused on patients in need of long-term support services to help them live in their homes and communities. We're excited to welcome the Integra team to the Elevance Health family. Their commitment to patients with complex and chronic needs is well-aligned with our focus on serving the needs of the people who need us most. In Medicare Advantage, personalized health solutions are resonating with seniors, notably dual eligible members with complex and chronic needs and our supplemental benefits, which emphasize social drivers of health, supporting members with in-home support, transportation needs, healthy groceries, assisted devices and more, continue to gain traction. We remain on track to produce double-digit organic growth in our individual MA business, led by growth in duals, and are excited about our plans for 2023. In the employer market, our share gains are being driven by our leading cost-of-care position and innovative solutions focused on consumer experience and engagement. Employers have come to expect more, and we're investing to meet their needs. Today, we have strong traction in our total health connection's fleet of advocacy solutions that serves 3.9 million members, representing a 33% year-over-year increase. The programs guide members to the next step in care through a simple, intuitive and personalized experience. We leverage real-time data analytics to identify health risks so their advocates can personally connect with members to proactively facilitate preventive and, at times, responsive care. Our commitment to whole health solutions extends to our care providers, where we continue to advance value-based care and are increasingly looking to integrate health equity and social drivers of health measures into our contracts. The early indicators we are seeing in Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid businesses demonstrate that value-based care delivers higher quality care and greater affordability. In fact, our value-based providers are helping us achieve significantly higher quality scores for impacted plans, including an 8-point improvement in quality compliance measures for Commercial members and value-based arrangements. In addition, our value-based provider partners are conducting 12% more annual wellness visits with our members on average and delivering lower overall costs for our Commercial, Medicare Advantage and Medicaid members, with 19% lower emergency cases per 1,000 for members and value-based arrangements, compared to those not and 15% lower inpatient admissions. With the highest local concentration of membership of any health insurer, we're taking a market-by-market approach to our provider strategy to accelerate value-based care. Our local market density is unique and a valuable strategic advantage that provides optionality, allowing us to balance partnerships and investments in certain care models and geographies with select ownership through Carelon in markets where we see opportunity. We do not believe a single primary care model will prove superior for all populations and markets over time, and we are committed to a thoughtful approach that considers the structure of care delivery in our local markets and our membership density across lines of business, notably with respect to complex and chronic members. With our deep roots in our communities, we're continuing to leverage our proprietary Whole Health Index, a dynamic model tracking the health of our communities across local, social and clinical drivers. We're increasingly using the tool to measure our impact on the health of our communities and to identify and better address local, social and physical drivers of health with an emphasis on health equity and members who need us most. We've leveraged the tool to identify at-risk or equity-challenged member populations across Medicare, Dual Special Needs plans, Medicaid and our Commercial exchange-based populations and we're working with community-based partners to coordinate engagement, outreach and support, bridging physical, behavioral and social services. In practice, we're reimagining the ecosystem of care delivery for our most vulnerable members with plans to scale learnings for even greater member impact in care coordination overtime. We're privileged to be in a position to positively impact our members' lives, especially in light of the challenges faced since the beginning of the pandemic. In addition to helping us achieve our purpose as an organization, to improve the health of humanity, we're confident that our efforts are being recognized through our industry-leading Medicaid RFP track record. Core to our enterprise-wide focus on Whole Health, we also continue to accelerate our service and capabilities business through Carelon to connect people to accessible, affordable and integrated care with focus on those with complex needs. The top priority for Carelon today is to work in concert with our health plans to develop offerings that drive differentiated value for the 47 million medical members we serve, including more than 20 million fully insured members and the more than 118 million consumers we support across Elevance Health. Partnering with owned and aligned providers, our near-term focus is driving greater affordability and quality outcomes by providing the right care in the right settings, such as enabling care in the home or more effectively managing specialty pharmacy. As an example, myNEXUS, with its deep experience in managing home-based care, recently launched a new post-acute care product serving our Medicare Health Plan in Indiana via a capitated risk-sharing arrangement. Enabling providers with better technology and tools, myNEXUS will help optimize appropriate levels of care post inpatient discharge, delivering a much better patient and provider experience while having a positive impact on our health plans and driving growth for Carelon. Over the next six to 12 months, we expect to scale the post-acute care product to all of Elevance Health Medicare markets. For more than 30 years, we've been recognized as a leader in behavioral health management, an area that is a major driver of healthcare cost today and a critical component of whole person health. We manage behavioral health benefits inside of Carelon for more than 40 million consumers. And our expertise in this space was reinforced recently when Beacon, a Caroline Company, was awarded a contract to participate in the operation of the new 988 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The launch of 988 is a game-changing shift in how mental health services are accessed in our country, and we're proud to be part of this historic milestone. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world. In fact, environmental, social and governance frameworks are integral to our enterprise strategy. And we understand the connection to long-term business success. Accordingly, we continue to invest in key areas such as health equity, greenhouse gas mitigation and community health as part of our ESG practices. We're also proud to be an initial signatory to the healthcare sector climate pledge focused on achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We are confident in our organization's ability to adapt and to achieve our pledge, having met our goal of powering all of our operations with 100% renewable electricity earlier this year, four years ahead of schedule. We're proud that these efforts have been recognized externally. Elevance Health was recently named to Points of Light 2022 List of the Civic 50, a national standard for corporate citizenship. Just 100 ranked our organization first among healthcare providers for just business behavior. And we are the highest rated managed healthcare company by ISS and Sustainalytics, including a perfect quality score from ISS. In closing, I'd like to thank our nearly 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members we are privileged to serve. Our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering, and we look forward to making a meaningful difference as Elevance Health. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? Thanks for the question, A.J. I think as you think about our commercial business, there's a couple -- like I want to parse out a little bit of what you're seeing in that business, because I think it's important to first look at the entire business. One, we've had strong and consistent growth and feel pretty good -- very good about our business in the last few years. And there's two elements. One is obviously the risk-based business and the other fee-based business. I'm going to start with the fee based, and I'll address your question directly on risk base. In terms of the fee-based business, we're making really good progress on the strategy around margin improvement. And as we've laid out on the five to one to three to one strategy, and we continue to grow our fee-based business, I think, at an industry leading rate. And just a couple of, I think, proof points that help show that even inside of the totality of the business, our fee revenue grew 7.9% year-over-year, and then if you just look at it sequentially, 7.3% for the six months ending June 30th, which shows that acceleration of growth that we've been talking about. And you compare that to our membership, which grew about 3.4% year-over-year. So clearly, there is really good improvement. And I think we're very much on the progression that we described at our Investor Day to improve our revenue for fee-based members. Turning to the operating margin, more in our risk-based business. As I've shared before, that does remain challenged by COVID, and that really is what we believe to be the most significant issue, and we do think it's transitory. We do expect our margins to recover to the pre-pandemic levels and are taking actions to do that. You saw an improvement overall from first to second quarter. But again, this has to pace through as we do renewals. The last thing I would say is, we also know we've been in this pandemic now for several years. COVID is not going to zero. Ultimately, as we think about our pricing in the commercial market, we're not changing anything about the approach or philosophy that we've used historically, we're always pricing to our forward view of costs. If you look at this year, COVID hit at a time high in January and February. So, as we look to forward pricing, we're looking around all of our costs and now, I think, have a much better perspective on projection of what those costs should be. And so, you'll see ratable improvement over the course. And maybe I'll ask John to just talk about your question on utilization a little bit. John? Thanks. Next question please. Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Justin. Let me address your first question. We have not changed our 2025 perspective in the short run, different impacts that we didn't obviously have at the time we gave that, but we haven't changed anything about our 2025 overall margin perspective across the businesses that we shared. So, I just want to be really clear about that. In terms of your second question, the City of New York contract, a couple of things on that. One, when we originally bid on this contract, it was set to go live in January 1 of this year. But as you know, and we've shared on this call, due to litigation, that go-live date has been delayed several times now. Based on the fact that we've been on in the active litigation, we had asked the City for some certainty around exactly what the benefits would be. And also, quite frankly, Medicare Advantage contracts take a lot of work to put up, and we want to make sure that the members were best served. We've served these members for a long time, and we needed greater certainty. So we did not feel, based on the inability of what's going on with the litigation as well as being prepared, that we could go forward with the contract. And then notably, the City remains one of our very important customers, and we continue to serve those clients on a fee-based business. So that's where we stand on the city in New York. Thanks very much for the question, though. Next question, please. Thanks for the question, Lance. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon, please address that. Pete? Yes. Thanks, Pete, and thanks for the question, Lance. And I think, as Pete shared, we're excited about this business. It's an important strategic lever for us. But importantly, it's really early innings. And the examples that I shared in my early -- earlier comments to show that we can begin to implement this in certain markets, get experience on it on a risk basis and then roll it out to the rest of our 20 million-plus risk-based members and 47 million total. So lot of opportunity for us, but we also want to make sure we execute this with precision and benefit both our health plans as well as Carelon. So, thank you. Next question, please. Thanks for the question. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to please address that. Felicia? Thank you, Felicia. I just want to reiterate one point, I think, that's really important that Felicia made, which she and John have said many times, which is the balanced portfolio that we have across Elevance Health. And one of the statistics that I think really brings at home is there's been more than 6 million Medicaid entrants as part of not doing redeterminations in our 14 Blue states. And we have significantly, regardless of the percentage you look at in our commercial business, have coverage now in nearly every county on our individual exchanges. So we've been planning for this. We're preparing for it across our businesses and feel very well prepared to manage that. And again, obviously, CMS has given the guidance to take up to 14 months and not determine more than one night at a month. So again, thank you very much for the question. But overall, we feel that we've got very good coverage. Next question, please. Sure. Pete, would you like to address that, please? Next question please. Well, thanks for the question. I'll have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our Commercial and Specialty Business, to address that. Morgan? Yes, thanks. I'm going to have Pete address your pharmacy penetration question. Pete? Yes. Thanks, Pete. I think what you heard from both Morgan and Pete is really, we're very pleased that we're winning in the most sophisticated and discerning segment of the market, and that really plays across all of our customers. So thanks very much for the question. Next question please. Yes, we can hear you, Gary. Thank you. And that, again, as John said, very consistent with the expectations that we've always had. Next question please. Sure. Let me ask Morgan Kendrick to comment on that. Please, Morgan? Yes. And thanks, Morgan. I think sort of summarizing that, we feel good about this business. We've had a pretty consistent strategy. We haven't looked for outsized growth. We want to be in markets where we can be for the long term and that's why you've seen us year-over-year, expand the counties we're in as we continue to see the stability of that marketplace. So again, that business is performing along our expectations, and we expect to be in more counties. We see some opportunities, obviously, as redeterminations come in as a real catchers met for some of that. So, thanks for the question. Next question please. Thanks, John. Next question, please. Sure. Felicia, would you like to address that? Thank you. Next question, please. Yes. And to the second part of your question, I think, I caught most of it, Ricky. But I think there's a few things, one, to your how are employees thinking about their workforce. As I think we shared a little bit earlier in the call Morgan did. Now we're really seeing, kind of, employers still expanding their workforce and looking for more benefits and to maintain the strength of their workforce. So we haven't seen any pullback yet in terms of our employer populations across any of the sized segments that we serve. That's not to say that, that couldn't happen. But at this stage, it's -- as you think about the challenges in the economy, they're more inflation-based than employment-based at this stage. And employers are still looking for strong solutions. One of the things that we're offering, obviously, is affordable products. We've been continuing to enhance our product portfolio. We have a very strong cost position. Again, one of the reasons we win is, we go in with a very strong medical cost position across all those segments. So I think from that perspective, we have not seen any noticeable difference. In terms of our own book of business, if you look at our history, we've got actually -- I really can't comment on the others who've given you some numbers around what they think would happen. But our book of business has been quite resilient. As you remember, we have a very deep -- we support school districts, public service -- public services, et cetera. And so, we have a very, I think, different profile across our businesses, and our history has shown that those have had greater stickiness during both up and downtimes in the economy. So, overall, I think at this stage, we're still seeing strong interest and strong growth from the commercial sector. Next question, please. Next question please. Next question please. Sure. Pete, would you like to respond? Yes. Thanks, Pete. I think that there's two points that I wanted to highlight from Pete's subscription. One, a core part of our strategy that we shared about Carelon is moving from a fee basis to a risk basis. And so when we acquired myNEXUS, we did have a large participation with them and knew them quite well in our Medicare business, but on a fee basis. So this is the next iteration across all of our Carelon services, where we now have, I think, much better insight and can move this to a risk basis. So that was just the beginning and why I see early innings there. And then the second thing is we see this as a huge opportunity, as you talk about network strategy, pull this through our value-based contracts and our partnerships and relationships. And again, another core part of our strategy where we see this as a very synergistic. So thanks for the question. Next question please. Next question please. Sure. Felicia? Thank you, Felicia. And now we'll take our last question. Thank you. And I'll have Pete address the Carelon strategy. But I think, what you saw certainly in our overall rebranding with Elevance Health is, our business has changed. We've been on a journey from just traditional health benefits, which are still important to us and continue to grow. And as John shared and just how our revenue has changed even over the last five years, a pretty significant shift. Carelon's a really important part of our move in the services strategy around the complex and chronic, but more importantly, that serving our captive membership already of 47 million members. So just maybe, Pete, you can talk a little bit more about how you see Carelon strategy evolving. Thank you, Pete, and thank you to everyone for joining us and for your questions this morning. In closing, we're really pleased with the ongoing momentum in our business in 2022-to-date. And we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continuing to deliver against the financial targets that we shared with you at our investor conference last year. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of the week."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for the question. As you know, the PHE was recently extended to October 13. So it follows that we are going to have Medicaid attrition related to redetermination that could begin as early as November. However, I would say, given back-to-school, it's also possible that COVID prevalence could rise around the September, October time frame or that the population might need boosters or other vaccines. So at this point, it's really simply too early to predict, but it's certainly possible that we could have a PHE extension into January of 2023. If there is another extension into January of 2023, that could lead to Medicaid attrition starting right around the February time frame. So redeterminations would then commence over what would be 14 months, given guidance from CMS that ask states to have up to 14 months to redetermine members and not redetermine more than one night of that membership in a single month. As we think about where we are, you should keep in mind that we operate obviously in 14 Blue states. And our Medicaid membership -- our total Medicaid membership, I'll say, has grown significantly across that platform. So as we think about where we are today, we are going to continue to work very closely with our commercial colleagues to make sure that we have in place a process for looking very thoughtfully market by market and having a view of the competitive dynamics in those markets and capture as much as we can inside of the Anthem 14 Blue states, where we will be offering ACA plans in nearly every county in 2023. So as we sit here today, we gave that early numbers, certainly with respect to 35% of that membership staying within Medicaid, another 45% or so going into Commercial plans, about 15% on the exchanges and 5% in uninsured, but the macro environment certainly has changed tremendously. What we'll say is that, we are positioned very well to navigate through the end of this PHE and the return of redeterminations when that happens, based on a very balanced portfolio here at Anthem, Elevance Health, I should say. And certainly, we'll continue to work closely with our Commercial colleagues to make sure that our members have access to care, continuity of coverage and can really navigate this landscape when redeterminations begin. Good morning and thank you, David. First and foremost, let me start by saying, we are pleased with how we are performing this year. We started with a very strong AEP, and that certainly has kept us on track to deliver double-digit growth in our individual MA business. You might also want to recall that most of our business continues to come in throughout the course of the year, because we have a very balanced portfolio when we look at our duals growth, and that membership comes in year round. It's too early to talk about 2023 and anything associated with double-digit growth. I will say, we expect to continue to have strong growth. We have what we believe will be very competitive products in the marketplace. Our benefit designs, which are really led with our supplemental benefit offerings as we think about whole health, continue to resonate with our consumers. And we continue to be very focused on going deeper in our markets, particularly in our Blue states. So when we think about how we are positioned today, with very nice competitive benefits, strategically, we've continued on that course as we head into to 2023. And I think we're positioned to continue to deliver strong growth. Long term, our focus and our -- certainly, our perspective on Medicare Advantage remains unchanged. This is a very attractive segment for us, strategically important with us and our Carelon services as well. And we're committed to continuing to deliver strong growth in our business. Yes. Ben, thank you for the question. I will say that we were really early leaders in the supplemental benefit areas because of our focus on whole person health. And what everyday extras or what we call essential extras allow us to do is to allow members to really personalize the benefit that best meets their needs. All of our members are different. And at the end of the day, we think it's important that they are able to have a range of benefit offerings that either allow them to provide transportation, grocery benefits, whatever that need is from an overall Whole Health perspective. So, I think the differentiation for us lies really in the personalization. So, we've developed a range of offerings that allow members to really improve their overall health outcomes, and that gives them the flexibility to be able to decide what works best for them. So ultimately, I think that's the differentiating factor for us from a Medicare Advantage perspective. We've tried to make sure we continue with that stability as we head into 2023 and certainly give members the opportunity to make those personalized decisions that works best for them."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $6.79 and adjusted earnings per share of $8.04, reflecting growth of more than 14% year-over-year. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy. Our results exceeded our expectations. And with momentum in all of our businesses and confidence in our growth trajectory, we have increased our full year earnings per share outlook. We ended the second quarter with 47.1 million members, up 2.7 million or 6.1% year-over-year, including growth of 276,000 members in the second quarter. We grew enrollment year-over-year in each of our benefit businesses with approximately 90% of our membership growth being organic, supplemented by the acquisitions of the Paramount and Integra Health Plans, which added 255,000 members and 43,000 Medicaid members in the first and second quarters of this year, and together strengthened our footprint in two attractive existing markets. Second quarter operating revenue of $38.5 billion increased $5.2 billion or approximately 16% over the prior year quarter, with strong growth in each of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid, Medicare and Commercial; premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends; the acquisitions of Paramount and Integra; and the timing of the MMM acquisition, which closed at the end of the second quarter in the prior year. Our services businesses, Carelon and IngenioRx, produced very strong growth. IngenioRx revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while the other segment revenue, comprised primarily of Carelon, grew operating revenue 31%. The strong performance in our services businesses is being driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy to work side-by-side with our health plans, the scale services that drive differentiated value for consumers, beginning with the more than 47 million medical members, which includes the more than 20 million that are fully insured, for whom we can more quickly roll out new capabilities. Beyond helping to improve our members' lives and reducing health care costs across the system, the growth of Carelon and IngenioRx are aiding diversification of Elevance Health's businesses and producing cash flow in noninsurance and therefore, nonregulated entities. Revenue eliminated in consolidation, a proxy for business between Carelon and IngenioRx and our own risk-based health plans grew 24% year-over-year in the second quarter and represented 21.8% of the consolidated benefit expense, up from 20.5% a year ago. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the second quarter was 87%, an increase of 20 basis points over the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by the shift in mix business towards government programs, which carry higher medical loss ratios relative to the Commercial business. The overall medical cost insurance businesses remained higher than what we consider to be a normalized level had the pandemic never happened, with Commercial furnace above, Medicare near normal cost levels, and Medicaid still somewhat below. However, medical costs in the quarter were slightly favorable to our expectations. We expect the cost structure for health plans to remain somewhat elevated in the back half of the year, which is reflected in our guidance. Elevance Health's SG&A ratio in the second quarter was 11.1% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 40 basis points over the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher investments to support our growth. Second quarter operating cash flow was $2.5 billion or 1.5 times net income, which includes the impact of higher working capital in relation to certain provider pass-through payments in one of our Medicaid states that we anticipate will be paid in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, we also continued to expect to pay $500 million, which is our share of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's litigation settlement. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 39.7%, in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares of common stock for $624 million. Year-to-date, we've been opportunistic with respect to share repurchases during periods of volatility in our stock and have already repurchased 2.5 million shares for $1.2 billion. Our full year outlook of $1.5 billion is, however, still an appropriate figure for full year modeling purposes. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 47.8 days at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 0.9 days sequentially and a decrease of 0.3 days year-over-year. ECPs would have been 46 days, excluding the timing of certain provider pass-through payments that we will anticipate in the third quarter of this year. As a reminder, DCPs were elevated by 1.6 days in the second quarter last year due to the timing of acquisitions. Normalizing for timing-related impacts, DCPs are very consistent on a year-over-year basis. Given stronger-than-expected performance year-to-date and the continued momentum in each of our businesses, we are increasing our full year earnings outlook. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $28.70, implying growth of approximately 14% off of the adjusted baseline of $25.20 provided at the beginning of the year. In closing, we are pleased to have delivered another strong quarter, our first reported as Elevance Health. In my 28 years with the company, this is easily the most prepared and well-balanced our enterprise has been as we look into the future. Strong underlying fundamentals, coupled with our balanced and diverse set of businesses, gives me confidence in our ability to deliver another strong year of growth in 2022, regardless of how the macroeconomic environment evolves. The diversification of our enterprise and the resilience that provides is an extremely valuable asset. Consider that in 2021, operating revenue of our Commercial and Specialty businesses represented just 25% of our total gross operating revenue, down from nearly 70% in 2008. And for the first time last year, operating earnings in our government business exceeded operating earnings in our commercial business. It is no coincidence that we have produced strong growth for our enterprise in both good and bad times for the broader economy in recent years. Simply put, we are well-prepared to meet the needs of our clients should they evolve in response to a more challenged business environment. Today, the momentum in each of our businesses, driven by the disciplined execution of our strategy, coupled with the diversity of our businesses, positions us uniquely well. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Yes. Thank you, and good morning A.J., and associated with utilization, in our first quarter call, I think we were very clear that the Omicron surge in January was most significant to the commercial market. And so that obviously has a direct impact on the commercial margins. And even as we go through the full six months and project out for the rest of 2022, we do believe that commercial will have a cost structure, when you add COVID and non-COVID combined, to be in excess of baseline -- above baseline actually each quarter for the year. Medicare is going to be close to baseline. And Medicaid, we expect to be a bit below baseline. Overall, the entire company above baseline for the rest of the year. So clearly, those cost structures being directed more towards the commercial marketplace have a direct impact on the commercial margins that you're seeing. And as Gail said, we do believe that they're transitory, and that we will price the forward trend for the future. Thank you. Thank you for the question, Gary and good morning. Associated with the seasonality, I'll just clarify for everyone on the line of what we talked about during the first quarter was that there are many of the services that Carelon offers are being sold to Commercial on a capitated rate basis. And so the seasonality that historically would have been in Commercial associated with those services is now going to be in our Carelon segment and Commercial will have less seasonality. So yes, that is still playing out exactly as we talked about 90 days ago, and that will continue to be part of the quarterly cadence for both of those entities over time. And then associated with the overall cost structure. As I had said, I think in A.J.'s question, we are expecting the commercial cost structure for COVID and non-COVID combined to be above baseline again in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter, which obviously puts pressure on the overall margins. Thank you. Thank you, Steve, for the question. So just for clarity, we have not provided any commentary associated with the difference between ACA and Group. We've talked about Commercial in total. So, I'm not exactly sure what comment that you were referring to, but it's not anything that was part of this call. And just to reiterate what I've said, we have seen overall cost structures in commercial to be elevated in excess of what a normalized baseline would have been, had COVID had never occurred. You can certainly look at the amount of membership that we have in fully insured risk versus ACA. And obviously, risk is the lion's share of the membership -- the group risk. I'm sorry, is the lion's share of the fully insured membership. So obviously, that is the primary driver. But overall, we do believe that the COVID costs are transitory. They're not going to go to zero, as Gail had said. We are going to proactively price for forward trend. But the impact that we have on our margins currently is a transitory piece of that equation. And so we feel very good about our long-term aspects. Thank you. Thank you, Ricky, for that multipart question. Let me try to answer the first part of it, and then ask one of my partners here to reply to the other part of your question in terms of cost structure. So we have been really disclosing COVID and non-COVID combined as our total cost and not really specifying or trying to parse out the -- at least publicly, the amount that's COVID and the amount that's non-COVID. And I can tell you that non-COVID, all by itself, is a bit below baseline, even in Commercial. And then when you add COVID on top, the total of the two exceeds baseline. We have seen still ER utilization being down from pre-pandemic levels. Inpatient is actually down a bit here this year. Outpatient is actually up a little bit compared to pre-COVID levels or pre-pandemic levels. But all in, the cost structure is the cost structure, we have to cover it all, and we certainly will. So, hopefully, that gives you the clarity you need. Yes. Thanks, Rob. Very good question. I would say, first and foremost, we are always working with our state partners to ensure that we have actuarially justified rates, rates that really mirror the acuity of the population. There is one really significant item, just to make sure that we're all aware of, and that's we're in an MLR collar or MLR rebate position in many of our Medicaid states currently. So we will be refunding back to the states amounts of the premium that we've been paid here this past year or so. And as we look at what future rate actions or rate filings could do, the first thing that they will do is they will reduce the amount of the MLR rebates before we end up with our final read. But at the end of the day, we feel very good about our ability to negotiate actuarially justified rates with our state partners. Thank you. Steve, I'm not positive I can comment on what other parts of the system you're referring to without a little bit more specificity on that. But I'll just say that we track utilization very closely. We certainly understand the seasonality factors associated with utilization. I think Felicia even mentioned going back to school and things that, that might cause, and we're trying to factor all those variables in. And we actually feel very, very good about the analytics and the informatics we have associated with this information. So, we have certainly put our best thinking forward in terms of our -- in terms of the cost trends, the pricing and the guidance that we've provided. So, thank you for the question. Yes. Thank you, Kevin, for the question. And certainly, some of the questions you asked were may be consistent with some of the things we saw in 2019. So let me just maybe reference a little bit what's different now versus then. So in 2019, we went through a redetermination process. It worked through very quickly. And then the overall acuity of the population was a little bit higher than what the rates that had been set, well, justified. And just FYI, there were retroactive rate increases ultimately, but there was clearly a disconnect for a few quarters there in 2019, where now we have a very well thought-out process that's going to take up to 14 months that won't even begin until after the PHE expires. The other thing is, as I had mentioned in a different question, we're in an MLR collar position in virtually every Medicaid market. And so the immediate impact to any of the rates will first be to reduce the MLR collar position that we're in. In 2019, we were -- had very, very few MLR collars. But I think the most important element of all this is now part of how the pricing is done, that the -- thanks to some of the great work our teams have done, that the standard rating input now, as part of the Medicaid pricing, includes an acuity change factor. And that was not the case in 2019. That was a one-off conversation, and now it's part of the standard input into the rates for 2022. So all-in, we think we're in a significantly better position today than we were then. 2019 might be informative but it's certainly not a precedent. So we actually feel very good about our future state prospects. Thank you for the question."

            "content": "Hey Nathan, thank you for the question. Yes, it's -- the business is cyclical. Typically, these cases renew on a 36 or 60-month cycle. So, you think about the very large year we had for the 2022 cycle, 2023 is down from that, and that's expected. There were a number of jumbos last year. What we're seeing notably, which is consistent with last year, is a number of cases going out for single vendor opportunities. That hasn't changed and what we've seen this year, albeit we have seen the dampening in the large jumbo cases in our geographies. But the conversations are consistent. You can certainly imagine, you alluded to the fact that we've got a talent challenge. And employers have shifted this concept to more of a human capital strategy and how they actually think about their benefits differently in attracting, retaining talent. So, that's been a big piece of it. At the end of the day, the conversations are generally focused around two things: number one, economics; number two, experience. When we think about the assets that we deliver from a network perspective, nationally, we score very well. Also, when you think about how we think about the experience component, Gail mentioned earlier our total Health Connection suite of services up 33%, with nearly 4 million of our commercial members. That's almost half of our commercial business is using that service. We think that's going to crescendo. So, we feel confident in it. Certainly, it's a smaller sales cycle. We're seeing that across the country. It's not notable to any geography, but we are seeing wins where we're seeing consolidation, and we're having -- we're starting to get the answers for the one-ones, they're affirmative, and we feel really good. Thanks again for the question. Yes, Scott. Thanks for the question. Generally, your question is around how we think about the '23 pricing. Again, we've noted we really like this business. There's a great opportunity. Our margins are performing as expected, quite honestly, for '22. We're just now pricing '23. We're in the middle of that cycle. Your point is spot on, that there's always an actor that's looking to take aggressive share in aggressive pricing points in each geography. We are seeing some firming, but there's always a new actor that wants to come into the mix, so to speak. It is a competitive market, but we continue to look at this as an expanding opportunity. As Gail alluded to and Felicia alluded to, when we think about the Medicaid redetermination, we are now in north of 95% of the counties in the geographies that we serve. So, we feel strongly about it. We're taking prudent, normal pricing actions. Nothing's changed in our pricing strategy. We're pricing to the forward view of trend with all of -- in modifying for all of the challenges that are currently facing in the business or in the economies. That said, we expect it to be expanding. We've been notified some expansions in some of our largest geographies. We know that we look good in those geographies. So, over the next 60 days through -- 60 to 90 days, we will firm up the position. But right now, we feel quite good about it."

And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, our President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of our Diversified Business Group and IngenioRx; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Business Division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Business Division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives and close on Anthem's proposal to change our holding company name to Elevance Health. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, antheminc.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Anthem. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Anthem is off to a strong start in 2022. In the first quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $7.39 and grew adjusted earnings per share by 18% to $8.25, exceeding our expectations. Based on the strong start to the year and the momentum in our business, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver another year of growth in line with our long-term 12% to 15% annual adjusted earnings per share growth target. As a result, we've increased our full year outlook to greater than $28.40 per share, representing growth of at least 12.7% of the adjusted baseline we provided last quarter. It's the ongoing momentum in every one of our businesses, driven by the disciplined execution of the strategy we shared with you at last year's investor conference, coupled with the balance and resilience of our core benefits business that is allowing us to produce this level of growth. We ended the first quarter with medical membership of 7.5% year-over-year to 46.8 million members, widening Anthem's lead as the largest insurer by U.S. medical membership. In recent years, Anthem has been on a journey to transform from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime trusted health partner, by focusing on whole health, addressing the physical, behavioral and social drivers that we know are critical to achieving optimal health. Our results demonstrate that our employer, consumer and state partners are universally looking for solutions that address underlying drivers of cost, while enhancing and simplifying the consumer experience. We are delivering in these areas and its propelling strong organic membership growth in each of our benefits businesses, in addition to creating opportunities to scale our service divisions. Last quarter, we shared that Anthem produced its strongest national account selling season in the history of the Company. Today, you can see in our results that commercial group fee-based enrollment grew by over 750,000 members in the first quarter alone, with a meaningful proportion of that growth driven by existing large employer clients consolidating their business with Anthem after working with us on a piece of their business in the past. Cost of care is paramount for self-funded groups, and the success we're seeing underscores our confidence in our leading cost of care position. Employers have come to expect more, notably in the way of enhanced experiences, and we continue to innovate to meet their needs. In the first quarter, we expanded virtual primary care capabilities to reach 5 million commercial members and expect to reach 10 million members by year-end. We're excited about the potential to expand access to care, especially in underserved rural areas, while offering convenient, personalized solutions. We also continue to advance client advocacy solutions and elevate our consumer engagement platform, Sydney Health, which has been core to our success in the employer market. Last year, we launched Sydney Preferred, a version of our Sydney Health app that allows employers to customize our engagement platform for their unique benefits and needs. Today, nearly 1.2 million members are on Sydney Preferred, and we closed the first quarter with more than 12 million registered users on Sydney, up approximately 40% year-over-year. Our commitment to Whole Health is also driving growth in our Government Business, where we are focused on health equity and meeting the needs of vulnerable members. Last quarter, we shared how our Whole Health index helps us better understand and address local, social and physical drivers of health. We're leveraging the tool to identify members with diabetes who may benefit from one-on-one virtual coaching, supplies and preemptive notifications to help better manage their health. In our diversified business group, new behavioral health programs, launched by Beacon, address family therapy, suicide prevention and offer a concierge model for members with comorbid conditions. All of these efforts support our focus on community health. Through our Whole Health index, we've been measuring Anthem's impact on health outcomes and are seeing encouraging, albeit early trends. Our health equity and community health initiatives that targeted vaccine outreach community health worker readiness, housing stability and diabetes management during COVID-19. Programs made possible by our deep roots in our communities were recognized recently by the Institute of Medicaid Innovation. All of this work keeps Anthem uniquely well positioned to serve the needs of our state partners and directly ties to our 100% Medicaid RFP win rate that we extended into 2022 with renewal awards in Indiana and Louisiana. Personalized Whole Health solutions are also resonating with seniors, notably dual eligible members with complex and chronic needs, and driving strong growth for Anthem and Medicare Advantage. For example, supplemental health plan benefits, like those offered by Simply Healthcare, address food and security issues by delivering food shipments directly to our most vulnerable members, benefit packages like our Everyday Extras, provides members the flexibility to choose which supplemental benefits matter most to them from menu of options. We remain on track to produce double-digit organic growth in our individual MA business, led by growth in duals. We also remain opportunistic in terms of driving inorganic growth through acquisitions. MMM has performed well since we acquired them last year, and we look forward to adding Integra, a high-performing plan serving high-needs Medicaid members in New York, to our portfolio when we close our purchase later this year. Across our organization, we're committed to accelerating value-based care, both in context of benefit expense for our health plans and growth of our diversified services businesses. We know that value-based care leads to higher quality outcomes, better patient provider satisfaction, more predictable cost for our health plans and by extension, more in our benefit packages. All of these factors can lead to higher star ratings in Medicare Advantage, which is a key strategic priority for Anthem. Over the last year, we significantly advanced our care provider strategy with investments and risk-bearing primary care providers and aggregators. This drive towards value-based care is one of the most important strategic imperatives inside of our organization. In 2021, more than 60% of our consolidated medical expenses repaid under value-based care arrangements, with roughly 1/5 of that or a low double-digit percentage of total spend in arrangements with downside risk. In the coming years, our primary focus will be to increase the penetration of downside risk sharing, including via global capitation. We expect to make significant strides in the coming years, targeting more than 1/3 of overall spend arrangements with downside risk in 2025, with significant increases in penetration in Medicaid, Commercial and Medicare. In addition to the benefits our health plans derive from value-based care, we see significant pull-through opportunities for our diversified business group in the areas of provider enablement, and carve-outs of specialized care management, including behavioral and home health. Beacon and myNEXUS are leaders in these areas, with the proven ability to generate high-quality outcomes and solid profitability in risk-based arrangements. Notably, 100% of myNEXUS' affiliated revenue earned from Anthem's health plans and 99% of Beacons will flow through risk-based contracts in 2022. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are making significant investments in our digital capabilities and platforms. We see three distinct benefits: elevating consumer and provider experiences, improving the cost and quality of care and improving administrative efficiency by automating manual processes. Adoption of our digital tools, combined with strong and rising customer satisfaction surveys, suggest that our consumers and care providers are finding value in our digital channels. Less than two years ago, we implemented live chat and AI messaging capabilities for our consumers and care providers to provide more choice and convenience. Today, chat is our best-performing channel for issue resolution and consumer experience metrics. Consumer chat usage grew by nearly 40% year-over-year in the first quarter, and now represents 24% of the contact mix. For care provider chat, usage grew by nearly 50% year-over-year and now represents 20% of our provider contacts. Meanwhile, Anthem is benefiting from improved efficiency, having reduced an estimated 1.2 million calls from members and another 1 million from care providers in the first quarter alone. Year-to-date, we've also made significant progress advancing our Health OS digital platform, which is now utilizing clinical data from providers and health systems for more than 20 million members. We use this data to advance clinical quality and elevated experiences by sharing more comprehensive data and insights with care providers and value-based care arrangements in order to facilitate better care management and personalize member interventions. We're also leveraging the platform to advance our cost of care analytics and streamline data collection for risk adjustment, all while automating processes that reduce administrative burden for our associates and providers. We're rolling this tool out rapidly with a goal of covering another 4.5 million members by the end of this year. In conclusion, we're continuing on our journey to transform from a traditional health benefits organization to become a lifetime trusted health partner and our proposed name change to Elevance Health marks an important milestone. Bringing together the ideas of elevate in advance, Elevance Health will reflect our position as a health leader, committed to elevating the importance of Whole Health in advancing health beyond health care for our consumers, their families and communities. Grounded in our mission and fueled by our bold and ambitious purpose to improve the health of humanity, Elevance Health represents the Company that we are today and will continue to be in the future. I would like to thank our nearly 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members who we are privileged to serve. Our passion to improve lives and communities is inspiring, and it extends to our own associates. We were pleased to once again be recognized as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for, with a ranking of 57, up from 71 last year, on this year's list of America's leading employers and workplaces. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $7.39 and adjusted earnings per share of $8.25, reflecting growth of approximately 18% year-over-year. Our first quarter results demonstrate continued momentum across all of our businesses, driven by the execution of our enterprise strategy, the benefits of investments in key capabilities and the balance and resilience of our core benefits business. We ended the first quarter with 46.8 million members, up 3.3 million or 7.5% year-over-year with nearly 3/4 of the growth being organic. In fact, we generated organic growth in each of our Medicaid, Medicare, commercial risk and commercial fee-based businesses. Membership grew by 1.4 million lives in the quarter alone, driven by the strongest national account selling season in Anthem's history and aided by the acquisition of Ohio Medicaid members from Advantage. Commercial membership is off to an especially strong start this year as Anthem's integrated solutions, which focus on Whole Health, the customer experience and total cost of care continue to resonate in the employer market. Our brand value and unique product offering, leveraging our deep local roots and value-based provider partnerships, also continued to gain traction with consumers. For example, in the ACA exchange market, we delivered individual membership growth of 8% in the quarter or 12% year-over-year. The Medicare open enrollment period was also consistent with our expectations as we remain on track to produce double-digit organic enrollment growth in our individual Medicare Advantage business. This includes strong growth in our dual special needs plans, where our strategic investments targeting specific benefit categories continue to attract consumers with complex and chronic health needs. In Medicaid, we overcame a significant membership headwind to start the year as additional carriers entered two of our existing markets, and we still ended the quarter up 319,000 net new members. In addition to continued organic membership growth, the acquisition of Paramount Advantage's Ohio Medicaid members in February added 256,000 members in the quarter. We are very excited about this strategic acquisition, which provides Anthem scale in Ohio's Medicaid program ahead of the future launch of the new contract we were awarded last year. First quarter operating revenue of $37.9 billion increased $5.8 billion or 18% over the prior year quarter, with strong growth in each and every one of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue due to the growth in Medicaid membership, the acquisition of MMM and Paramount and the individual Medicare Advantage and commercial risk-based enrollment growth, in addition to premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends. We also produced strong double-digit organic growth in our IngenioRx and Diversified Business Group businesses. Our services businesses are off to a strong start this year as IngenioRx's value proposition is gaining traction in the market. The Diversified Business Group continues to execute on the strategy we articulated at our Investor Day in March of 2021, growing both affiliated and unaffiliated operating earnings across its portfolio of best-in-class assets. In the first quarter, DBG continued to grow its risk-based arrangements with our commercial health plans consistent with our strategy. With the risk transfer between businesses, we expect more seasonality in DBG's earnings with a larger proportion of full year earnings in the first quarter relative to prior years and a decrease in the seasonality inherent in the commercial business. It is important to note that this affects seasonality only. Our annual segment target margins for the Commercial and Specialty business division are unchanged. Revenue eliminated in consolidation, representing intersegment business, grew 23% year-over-year and represented 21.4% of benefit expense in the first quarter, up from 20.7% in the same period a year ago. Anthem's consolidated benefit expense ratio for the first quarter was 86.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the continued shift in mix of business towards government, which has a higher medical loss ratio. Relative to our expectations as of mid-January, when the Omicron surge was still peaking, in the terms of the at-home COVID testing coverage rule had just been released, our medical cost structure developed meaningfully better than our original guidance ranges, driven by a lower net impact from COVID. Specifically, the Omicron surge dissipated faster than we had expected in February, while producing lower acuity COVID cases relative to prior surges. This combined with the absence of any material stockpiling or abuse of free at-home COVID test, helped drive favorability in the first quarter benefit expense ratio relative to our initial guidance. Even with these positives, the overall cost of care in the quarter was still above what we would consider to be a normalized level. Anthem's SG&A expense ratio in the first quarter was 11.5% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 70 basis points over the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher investments to support our growth and digital transformation. First quarter operating cash flow was $2.5 billion or 1.4x net income. Please note that we continue to expect to pay our share of the BCBSA litigation settlement of approximately $500 million later in 2022, which was included in the guidance we provided for full year operating cash flow of greater than $6.9 billion as we discussed on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. As of the end of the first quarter, Anthem's debt-to-cap ratio was 39.2%, in line with our expectations and well within our targeted range. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 46.9 days at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 1.7 days from year-end and in line with the first quarter of 2021. Medical claims payable once again grew faster than premium revenue in the first quarter relative to the prior year. With respect to our outlook, we are pleased to have delivered a stronger-than-anticipated start to the year. Outperformance in the first quarter has increased our confidence in our ability to grow adjusted earnings per share of 12% to 15% in 2022 off the adjusted baseline of $25.20, in line with our long-term target. We now expect benefit expense ratio for the full year to be at the midpoint or in the lower half of our initial full year guidance range for this metric. Given the strong start to the year, we now expect to produce adjusted net income per share greater than $28.40, representing growth of at least 12.7% from our adjusted baseline. With the recent extension of the federal public health emergency, we also now expect Medicaid redeterminations will begin later than we had previously assumed. While the extension will enable us to maintain our Medicaid membership longer, please note that we will also incur increased cost associated with the PHE in our Medicare and commercial risk-based businesses for an additional three months. Importantly, Anthem is uniquely well positioned to navigate the end of the public health emergency and to support continuity of care for Medicaid members who lose access to Medicaid by providing a robust set of commercial offerings. The momentum we have in each of the balance and resilience of our core benefits business, should allow us to maintain healthy levels of membership, while continuing to scale our diversified services operations. Consistent with this strategy, we are well positioned to continue delivering against the financial targets we shared at our March 2021 Investor Conference. In that context, I want to point out that while we are excited by strong growth in our commercial business and the expansion of our risk-based arrangements with our diversified business group, the operating margin of the Commercial & Specialty division remains challenged by the net impacts of COVID. However, while the year-over-year margin performance in our reportable segments table includes the impact of the seasonality shift I mentioned earlier, the underlying performance of the business is better than the optics. Relatedly, we would caution against annualizing first quarter operating profit of the other segment, which includes the Diversified Business Group and the impact of the seasonality shift in that business. Importantly, the expanded risk-sharing arrangements with DBG have no impact on our full year margin expectations for the Commercial & Specialty Business. We expect commercial margins to recover as the effects of the pandemic subside. We also anticipate strong earnings growth in our Medicare business. These opportunities, coupled with the expectation of continued strong double-digit growth in our services businesses, Anthem's programmatic approach to M&A and our opportunistic focus on share repurchases, leave Anthem uniquely well positioned for growth in the coming years. With that, operator, we will now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Interested, if you could give us your perspective on the final 2023 Medicare Advantage rates certainly looked quite solid from my opinion. And just interested in how you're thinking about some of the gaming theory at this point just around competitive psychology out there, just given what seems to be a pretty strong tailwind that we're seeing around the 2023 MA rates?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Scott. I'm going to have Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to address your question.\nFelicia Norwood: So, good morning, Scott, and thank you for the question. With respect to the CMS final notice, the expected rate increase, excluding CMS' estimate of coding trend, was 4.88%, which was certainly better than we expected. We're also very pleased with the progress that we've made in stars, last October, which will have approximately 73% of our members and plans set up four stars are higher in the payment year for 2023, which is up from 58% in payment year 2022. So, coupled with the positive proposed rate increase from CMS, we think that 2023 is shaping up well. Our plans have stayed competitive as we focus on supplemental benefits to address whole person health and believe we will continue to remain competitive. So, all things considered, we would expect our Medicare margins to be inside of our target range. And we would expect another predictably competitive year with respect to Medicare Advantage.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Felicia, and thanks, Scott. And as you heard, I think we feel really good about our Medicare Advantage, especially the start to this year and going into next.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Question, cost trends and -- can you give us a little bit of color of where you see COVID versus non-COVID across the three businesses in the quarter? And John, you also talked about commercial and some investments you're making there, running a little bit below. Where do you think commercial margins can shake out over the next two or three years once you get passed through the five to three to one and commercial trend normalizes?\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thanks, Justin. So in terms of COVID and non-COVID combined, as you know, that there was a significant spike of COVID in January and then it came down even at a faster rate in February and March than we had seen a decline at any point in time during the entire pandemic. Having said that, Commercial had the highest COVID cost in the quarter on a comparative basis, so Commercial COVID and non-COVID combined were clearly above baseline for the quarter. Medicare was next. And if you take Medicare COVID and Medicare non-COVID combined, it was still above baseline, but performed actually much better than Commercial. And then Medicaid continues to actually be the line of business that's performing the absolute best during the entire pandemic from a COVID and non-COVID combined perspective, and the total of those two are relatively close to baseline. So all in, the Company was above baseline, even though it was better than our overall expectations. Associated with commercial margins, we do feel good about the targets that we laid out in Investor Day back in 2021. As you know, we talked about getting to a 10.5% to 11.5% range by 2025. We've got a lot of things going on with COVID. It's certainly the single biggest factor that is causing commercial margins to be a little challenge this year versus prior years. And we also have some seasonality issues with our risk deals with our diversified business group, and that's not going to impact the annual margins at all, but it will impact certainly the quarterly margins. And Diversified Business Group, as I said in my prepared comments, I would not annualize that because of the fact that the shifting seasonality. And then Commercial, I wouldn't annualize that either because of that same aspect. So, we feel very good about the commercial growth and where we're heading as a company and the value proposition it has and feel very good about our 2025 targets. We're just challenged this year given -- or this quarter, the high COVID in January. But thanks for the question, Justin.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: I wondered, if can you just get updated thoughts on how you're thinking about the re-verifications on the Medicaid side. I know it's delayed. Does that change your thinking about how much of a roll off there might be? What opportunities there might be for you to recapture your own in other areas like the exchanges or in the commercial book? And then also just in that aspect, the enhanced subsidies, which are slated to expire this year on the public exchanges. How important is it that those get extended? And you're thinking about recapturing some people that might come off on the re-verifications.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the multipart question, A.J. We'll try to address it because there's a number of pieces in that, one about our -- how we're thinking about re-verifications in Medicaid, which right now, as you think about, we've said, with the extension, we're really looking for those to begin sometime towards the late part of the summer. We also believe that they're going to be paced over time. So, I think it's important to remember that the states now have up to 14 months to do the re-verifications. And as a result of that, each state will have a very different cadence of that. So, we do think that will be more phased in. In terms of your second part of your question, I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick to address that in terms of how we're thinking about capturing that. We've done quite a bit of work on that, and I know we've shared some of the statistics about where we see that business going. But I think Morgan can offer a lot more color on that business. So Morgan?\nMorgan Kendrick: Yes. Thanks, Gail, and A. J., good morning. We have done a lot of work. And if you think about the fact that the Commercial business, the Medicare business -- well, the government business in entirety, as well as our marketing organization and our government affairs partners have worked to build out a plan for when re-verification begins. And presently, we're expecting roughly 35% of the present Medicaid membership to stay with the Government division and then 45% of that will move into commercial group insurance, with another 20 moving into the individual ACA exchanges. Certainly, the commercial group insurance will be one that the employers will pick it back up as they begin re-verification. But on the exchanges, I think one thing that's notably important is we talked last quarter about a renewed focus on our individual ACA business. And looking at that business differently and more competitively, we've expanded the product offering. We've expanded the network opportunities. We've expanded the counties in which we serve our customers from 71% to 83% of the counties in our 14 geographies this year. So, we feel we're poised quite well to pick up when verification begins. And as Gail noted, that certainly will slide over a period of time given the 14 months that the states have to continue to work. But thanks again for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And just a bit of a clarification, 35% really relates to the lives that were added during the suspension of redeterminations. So as you know, some of our growth is also the result of winning new RFPs and new entrants into markets. But overall, we feel good about the plan. We've obviously had this in place for a number of years. And in addition to capturing some of our own Medicaid lives and Commercial, we think we have an opportunity to capture other Medicaid lives that will be coming off the books. So again, we've been planning for it. We hope to see a very organized transition of this and that's what we're working for. So thanks very much for the question. And next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMatt Borsch: Yes. Could I just ask about your commercial enrollment -- your enrollment outlook for the rest of the year, but particularly on the commercial side because you did have such a strong result in the first quarter, you're already well above, as I can see it anyway, the high end of your guidance ranges on both insured and self-insured enrollment. I'm wondering, how you see it progressing from here?\nGail Boudreaux: I'm going to ask Morgan to address the question on commercial.\nMorgan Kendrick: So, Matt, thanks again for the question. So yes, we've had a fantastic start to the year. We do expect that to continue. Certainly, north of 50% of our business, especially on the upper end, all of -- just about all of the national business is January focused. So we've kind of gone through that. The balance of the business will be the continued local market business. And we've seen a big uptick in our fee-based business, which is terrific. We see the next big tranche coming on in July. I wouldn't expect it to be materially larger than what we've seen in typical years, but we're growing that business nicely month-over-month. To me, the assets are resonating in the market. When I look at how the business is performing. And also the opportunity back to the comment earlier on expanding in account value, the 5:1/3:1 strategy is proceeding nicely, just given the actual opportunity with the fee-based business around stop-loss. Presently, our penetration, we've got opportunities there as well as our specialty products, pharmacy as well. So I feel really good about it. I wouldn't expect it to be -- right now, we've said that we would be somewhere around 1 million members, commercial business full year. And we have some attrition that certainly bleeds off through the year of the national business, but feel good about our position now and for the balance of the year is how it's setting up.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question. Overall, strong growth and we really feel that we had a really strong selling season. And as Morgan said, feel good about our positioning. So thanks again and next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: John, I just wanted to follow up on the updated expectations for MCR for the year. I guess given the significant beat in the first quarter, I guess looking at the updated guidance, it doesn't seem like your expectation expectations have changed significantly for cost trend over the balance of the year. I guess, is that fair? And are you still expecting, I guess, second quarter cost trend to be above baseline levels? And related to that, I'd just be curious if you're seeing any signs of a recovery in surgical procedures that some other med tech companies have talked about in April? Just be curious on your updated second quarter outlook.\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thanks, Nathan. I appreciate the question. We did end the quarter better than anticipated, but still above baseline, certainly, very pleased with our start for the year. However, there is still uncertainty, boosters, vaccination, potential spikes in COVID. But we feel very good about where we are right now. And with those unknowns, we still believe that we want to take a prudent posture to our guidance. With that, though, right now, we have a bias that our medical loss ratio is going to be closer to the midpoint to the lower half of the range. So it is an improved outlook from what we talked about 90 days ago, but still very prudent given the overall circumstances. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: I wanted to ask about the significantly higher interest rate backdrop we find ourselves in. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how you think this will impact your investment portfolio over the next couple of years as your investments mature and reinvested. And also, I guess, how should we think about this as impacting the EPS growth rate you're targeting over the next few years? Wondering, if there is going to be used potentially invest further in the business or potentially this could help fuel you towards the higher end or maybe even slightly above the outlook you've laid out?\nJohn Gallina: Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll take that one as well. On the interest rates and its impact, you look at our investment portfolio we have about $35 billion in fixed maturities at this point in time. And about 30% of that $35 billion is in variable rate. So, there is an immediate benefit that portion of the portfolio gets from the rising interest rates. And then you look at the other half of the balance sheet. And as you know, we try to target close to a 40% debt-to-cap ratio. We're at 39.2% at the end of the quarter, so very much in line with our targets. And that right now is about $23 billion of the debt, and only less than 10% of that is variable rate which obviously will go up. So we're actually winning the arbitrage game from that perspective. And so the rising interest rates are actually a net, net, good guide to us. In terms of long-term earnings expectations, we're still very comfortable reaffirming the 12% to 15% growth rate in EPS that we've been talking about here since our last Investor Day. And I think what these interest rates do is give us a lot more flexibility in terms of decisions that we can make and be more strategic with those decisions here in the future. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Gail, can you elaborate more on the carve-out opportunity with Beacon? And myNEXUS, maybe just more specifically myNEXUS and just elaborate like you're doing differently? It sounds like something is new here. I've kind of thought about this more as a utilization management play, but I hear you talking more about risk. So, just anything that strategically changed would be helpful.\nGail Boudreaux: Great. Well, thanks very much for the question. And I think myNEXUS is a great example as our AM and Beacon and some of the other assets that we have inside of the Diversified Business Group. When we brought myNEXUS into the family, the opportunity, obviously, to transition patients from the hospital to the home, we had strong expertise with them already in our Medicare Advantage business. But part of our goal is to do two things: one, to take our assets and embed them in our value-based payment arrangements. So as I mentioned, we have a number of those arrangements already that we're working on, both with primary care assets that we've invested in, plus also those that we're moving to value-based care. We see that as a downstream opportunity, but we also have an opportunity to capitate that business inside of Anthem's health plan and there's a huge runway for us there. And so, generally, we've started in our diversified business group first with a fee-for-service arrangement. And then as we get confidence in our ability to execute and do well with that, we're moving that along the risk continuum to cap, and that's a good example of that. It might be a good opportunity for Pete to share a little bit about how he sees what's happening in our diversified business group, and maybe even talk a little bit more about myNEXUS capabilities. Pete?\nPeter Haytaian: Yes, I would -- appreciate that, Gail. And I think Gail answered it really well comprehensively. I would say though, what you've sort of referenced a change in strategy, let me just reiterate what our strategy is. We're really focused on managing the complex and chronic patients and managing the complexities in health care more generally. And as Gail said, our primary client is Anthem. The opportunity is very fast. When you think about the complex and the chronic members and the spend associated with that population, you're talking about around $12,500 per member per year. Compared to an average commercial member, that's about $4,500 per member per year. So you can see there's a lot of spend there, a lot of opportunity there. And as Gail said, as we get more mature in the development of our assets, when you think about things like myNEXUS, we think there's a lot of opportunity to actually grow the portfolio. Yes, it is known towards UM capabilities and its access to care capabilities in terms of managing home care, but we see a lot of natural extension opportunities. So for example, we're very focused on post-acute care. We're very focused on DME as an opportunity. We're focused on social determinants of health. These are all areas in that complex and chronic category, where we can ultimately take risk and drive more value for our health plan businesses, creating predictable and stable cost of care, but then importantly, generating value in the DBG and incremental value for Anthem overall.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Rob Cottrell from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Cottrell: I guess I'll ask about the upcoming national account selling season given the strength that you all saw for this year. Any early commentary you can provide given the kind of increased expectations for switching into 2023?\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Morgan, why don't you address that?\nMorgan Kendrick: Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. This season was spectacular. As John said, it was the best we've ever had in the Company. So I'll tell you, the business doesn't all -- the cycle isn't always the same. These very, very large cases, usually bid on a 36-month cycle. So certainly, we're not seeing the volume. It's interesting, we've seen some very early, very large 2024 prospects already that we're bidding on. But I expect the assets to continue to resonate and our win rate to be consistent with what we've seen in the past. We continue to build upon what we've done. And our digital assets are resonating quite nicely, our clinical assets as well. So, it's a bit early. We do have some wins already in cases and the volume differ by year and that's not inconsistent. So it's not unexpected. Thanks again for your question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Morgan. I think, to add to that, he mentioned a couple of areas that have been really important for us. One is consumer experience, our investment in digital platforms. I mentioned Sydney Preferred has been very popular, along with our consumer advocacy model. And then the last area is our high-performance networks. Across all of the Blue system, I think we've done really well, and that's been a really strong validation of our unique cost of care position for the system. So thanks very much for the question. Again, really strong selling season and very encouraged by what we're seeing.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: John, your DCP was up close to two days sequentially in the first quarter on what has already been a fairly conservative posture through the pandemic period. Could you talk about the drivers of that? Were there any kind of payment timing issues that might have influenced that? Or was that all just growth in IBNR?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Dave, and I appreciate the fact that you recognized that we've already had a conservative stance associated with our reserves. But -- our approach to reserves has been both prudent and consistent, and we obviously need to ensure that we follow actuarial standards and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Associated with the first quarter, there is a natural seasonality aspect to the days and claims payable metric. And the first quarter has typically been a little bit higher than the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. And you can see that the last several years and that happened again this year. A lot of it has to do with a lot of new clients coming on, and we did have such a significant new sales activity. And as you know, we have 1.4 million new lives in the first quarter alone. And it usually takes a little bit of time for those folks to really get through to the doctors and get the manning and get all those claims paid. So, it's very natural to have a small increase in the first quarter. I would say that we feel very confident with the strength of our balance sheet and that the reserves that we booked as of March 31. They're very consistent with the reserves that were booked on December 31. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: I just wanted to ask about IngenioRx. And one, how it came out in the quarter versus your internal expectations? And then secondly, you talked about the strong growth in the commercial market. Can you maybe talk about the cross-sell opportunity, the penetration that you have? And did you see that pull-through come through here in 2022? Or is there a longer selling season once you bring the commercial member on?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Lisa. I'm going to have Pete address that.\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Lisa. First of all, we're really pleased with our progress and growth occurring in the pharmacy business. We're encouraged by what we're seeing and we saw through Q1 '22 in terms of the receptivity in the marketplace around IngenioRx around our integrated offering as we penetrate Anthem's ASO commercial business. In fact, we saw about a 300% year-over-year improvement in the members sold when you compare Q1 of '21 to Q1 of '22. And I do want to point out where we're seeing a really good traction, that's in the middle market and down market, where I think Anthem has a lot of strength. And we create a lot of value. So a really good place for us to be. As it relates to our operating game performance and the differences there, Q1 '21 over Q1 '22, it's really completely explained by a one-time positive reconciliation item that we mentioned previously in '21. Without that, we're completely on track. We remain confident in achieving our '22 operating gain expectations and our growth expectations.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRivka Goldwasser: Can you give us an update on the New York group MA contract? There's some news that's been delayed from April 1. So when do you expect to onboard it? And how should we think about the impact on guidance for the rest of the year considering that I think it was supposed to be dilutive for 2022?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Ricky. First and foremost, I want to say that we are looking forward to serving the retirees of the city of New York and extremely -- remain extremely pleased about have been awarded this contract -- have been awarded this contract. We've had a long relationship with the city, and we do continue to administer those benefits for the employees and our fee-based business today just as a bit of background. As you mentioned, based on the legal challenge, the city did not move forward as planned on April 1, and the city has appealed the decision, however. At this stage, given that process, we'll share more definitive information when it becomes available. As you think about how you should think about the financial impact, it's not dissimilar from what we said on our last call when we had a three-month delay at hand, which was directionally slightly positive as we're still incurring, as you know, run rate costs from being ready to go on 1/1, and that still remains the case today. So thank you, question, and we look forward to serving the city.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Just a quick question on your capitated strategy and increasing your downside risk sharing. I was wondering if you could kind of give us an opportunity or an idea of what the margin is there versus typical MA margins and kind of where that could go? What you're targeting? And how that is progressing with the capitation membership that you've achieved so far?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks very much for the question, and thanks for bringing it up. I'll just sort of start really at a broader perspective. Our care provider strategy is really a core component of our enterprise strategy, which is the integration of our Whole Health focus. And we've set a couple of key things. One, better outcomes we see by capitating and moving to more upside downside risk. Certainly, higher satisfaction, better and predictable outcomes from our health plans higher star ratings, which we think because of the alignment drives and greater stability for our benefits business, MA, our Medicare Advantage business, but also our Commercial and Medicaid businesses are a really important part of the strategy. Over the past year, we've made some very significant advancements in that strategy, particularly with our investments in risk-bearing primary care providers and aggregators, but we've also been advancing those that we haven't invested in around our VBC process. And that ties very much to our high-performing networks, and we're seeing growth there, as I mentioned a few moments ago. So -- as I think about those and your direct question, these are a kind of an early stage. We do see pull-through opportunities. So there's more than just your question about how does it affect MA. We see pull-through opportunities in our diversified business group, and they're resonating things like combining Aspire with those groups in their palliative care offering. We just talked about myNEXUS a little bit. And again, those are opportunities for us against to advance our overall performance at Anthem generally. As we move, we're moving very specifically to your question, to move to more capitation risk within the Anthem health plans. This year, we started some of the services like AIM. But our strategy again isn't reliant on a single model. So, I want to again reiterate that I've shared that in the past. As we see our value-based care mature, we think that there's a number of models in that. Specifically, about 60% of our consolidated medical expense, as I mentioned, is paid under VBC. That number is interesting, but I don't think it's the most important. The number that we're really targeting is moving upside and downside risk. We have global capitation, and as I mentioned, Today, we're about low double-digit range across our enterprise, with about 40% in Medicare in capitated arrangements to put some perspective on that. Our target is that about 1/3 of our overall spend in value-based care by 2025 we'll have downside risk. So, again, a pretty significant move and again, that's across Medicaid, Commercial and Medicare do you get a sense of the breadth of the strategy that we're deploying. So overall, feel good about the progress we're making. I think there are a number of value drivers across our business beyond just the simple question around Medicare Advantage. But clearly, that's an important one, both for top line and bottom line in our Medicare as well as our other businesses. So thanks very much for the question. And next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: I want to understand a little bit better the admin fee growth of 7% against that really strong membership growth, and this movement of 5:1 down to 3:1. And just sort of understanding where you are on that path? And maybe what's the pushback from employers that aren't signing up for those additional services? And lastly, if you could just include stop loss as one of those services in terms of trends you're seeing, that would be helpful.\nJohn Gallina: Yes, thanks for the question. Certainly, we're very pleased with the growth. The admin fee growth is both a combination of the ASO fees on the fee-based membership along with the fee-for-service aspects of many of these add-on value proposition type services. And then, we -- as you know, on the 5:1 to 3:1, we're doing very well. We had about a year delay at the beginning of COVID, but we ended 2021. And it began 2022 at about 4:1 within that range. And we still feel very good about hitting 3:1 by 2024. In terms of the overall growth, I mean, look at the membership, I mean the membership is just going awesome, our best national account selling season ever, and that's obviously adding to the admin fee revenue growth.\nGail Boudreaux: And maybe Morgan to comment a little bit about what's happening in employer decision-making?\nMorgan Kendrick: Yes. And, Josh, thanks again for the question. When I think about the reasons for the win, it's basically two things it's economics and experience. And when you look at the up market business, let's just focus there for a minute. It's one of the things that's consistent is buying various levels of advocacy services. So it's a heightened service model on the front end, which is probably north of 90% of our business. That's part of complementary to the just base admin fee that John described earlier. Also, we think about the clinical model that's unique and more elegant connecting back to a higher order front end. That's another model that we've seen great success for in the national market. In fact, we launched in 2018 with Total Health, Total You. Presently, we're sitting almost 7 million members across both the national business and local markets that have accepted that product and enjoying the product and what it's delivering. When you think about where the market has kind of evolved to your point around what people are looking to buy, I mean the labor market is tight. Most employers look at their health benefits as a human capital strategy, and they're looking for these unique nuanced ways to have a better solution rather than just a health benefits product. Lastly, commenting on your comment around the -- your question regarding stop-offs, there's a big opportunity there for us. When you look at the penetrable market, up market, we have a very, very large percent of it. We've got roughly 60% of our business in the stop-loss business penetrated today. We expect that to continue and look for different opportunities to serve our employers through value-based arrangements where it's a pay for value. And we do find the sign-up or the employer uptake to be quite large when it's positioned that way when payment is received upon value delivered. So again, thank you for your question.\nGail Boudreaux: And thanks, Morgan, John, just to put a fine point on it, Josh, you think the strong growth that we've seen, particularly across the commercial business, is a really nice runway for us to add additional services. And that's really been the trajectory of our business over the last several years is continuing to consolidate employers and continuing to demonstrate our value first on the medical cost side but also on digital tools and other things that we're bringing to market. So, we feel good about the trajectory and the opportunity that we have. And again, very strong growth, and we're really pleased to see it.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color about what was driving the improvement in MLR, specifically, COVID, non-COVID? And if you can go into a little more detail about the types of procedures that you don't expect or that are coming in better than expected?\nJohn Gallina: Thanks, Kevin. Specifically associated with the first quarter medical loss ratio, really have to look at what the situation was when we first provided guidance. The Omicron variant was peaking at a higher point than at any time since the pandemic began. And the home testing rule adjustment issued, amongst other things. And so, part of the guidance that we provided at that point in time was having those facts in front of us. What would happen was is that February and then March had even a much more significant drop in positivity rate that we had seen for any of the other prior surges that we've had since COVID started. And then we're also very pleased that there is no evidence of any abuse or stockpiling of the free home testing kits that was part of our concern as well. And non-COVID obviously, went back up as COVID went down as this occurred at every phase through the pandemic. But all in, the cost structure was better than our expectations, still above baseline, but better than our expectations. And that really was the primary driver of the better performance in the quarter.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Just a quick confirmation question and then the real question. First, on the investment income, $360 million in 1Q, that puts you above the run rate for the full year guidance to $1.1 billion. I guess the question there is, was the $151 million of net loss on financial instruments in 1Q, was that part of the full year guide for non-investment income or is that separate? And the real question was just quickly just to confirm, a lot of the discussion around the seasonality of MLR. But as far as the comment you made last quarter about 55% of income in the first half of the year, is that that tossed out the window now? Or is that still valid as we kind of think about that comment that you made last quarter?\nJohn Gallina: Thanks, Steve. I'll see if I can answer both those questions. On the investment income, do not run rate our first quarter performance. And first of all, know the loss on the write-down of the assets was not part of that. The outperformance really to do with our alternative investment portfolio and some of the positives that has come through, we're very, very happy with that, but we do not believe it's run rate. And then associated with the seasonality and the MLR, again, we're very pleased with the strong start for the year. And we did raise our full year guidance to $28.40. Simple math will tell you, $8.25 is about 29% of the full year. Essentially, for modeling purposes, I'd say the current consensus estimates for the second quarter right now are a reasonable approximation of second quarter expectations. So hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: I might just piggyback on that last thought, John. I'd just go a little bit further. If we look at the last five years or so, MLR almost always grew sequentially every quarter. This year, because of the COVID cost you're anticipating, you had a different cadence that fortunately didn't play out. So the questions are, are we just back to a typical sequential MLR build through the year? Is that reasonable? And then same question for G&A, I think in the last five years, with the exception of one of '21, G&A dollars generally just grew sequentially throughout the year. It looks like now they would have to drop for a while otherwise you might miss your full year guidance. But MLR cadence, are we sort of back to normal? And then on G&A, do we -- how do we think about that over the next few quarters?\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Sure, Gary. Good questions. On the medical loss ratio, we're not completely back to normal. There are still certain things associated with the public health emergency, where various cost shares are waived. The free home testing kits, even though they weren't abuse or stockpiling of those, there was a cost. They did cost. And we expect to continue to incur those throughout the entirety of the public health emergency. So we think the seasonality factors will differ a bit from historical patterns because we're just in a completely different situation. And then associated with the SG&A and the cost structure, some of it is also opportunistic spending of accelerating investments in our digital areas when we have the ability to accelerate. And our expectation is, is that with the really excellent top line growth that we've seen, clearly, top line growth does include some variable costs that will obviously be incurred above and beyond what had been assumed. But we feel very good about still hitting our guidance numbers for the full year. So, unfortunately, I don't think our historical seasonality patterns are a great proxy given the situation that we're in this year.\nGail Boudreaux: I think we have time for one last question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: John, mine is an MLR-related question. It has to do with medical cost inflation. And I guess could you talk about what you guys are seeing as it relates to cost inflation? I'm thinking about things like provider wages and medical supplies that could be inflation impacted versus what you guys are doing to offset that. And the question really is, are you guys seeing inflation yet? And maybe if you can rank order the big buckets of what you can do to offset inflation? Clearly, virtual is one of the things you can do to offset capitation and risk sharing is another thing. Just trying to understand the big puts and takes as it relates to MLR cost drivers, focusing on inflation.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, George. I think, first, there's no question that the labor market is tight. So as you think about inflation, we hear it certainly from our provider partners, and we see it in certain parts of our own business. Now let me start with the biggest bucket, which is hospital pricing. As you know, the majority of our contracts are three years in duration. So, we negotiate roughly 1/3 of those each year. And yes, there is more pressure on the system. But at this point, we're not seeing incremental rate pressure. And quite frankly, we believe our ultimate responsibility is -- that's paramount for our customer is affordability. So we have -- we're keeping costs contained to the lowest possible level and take that responsibility very seriously. It's really the core of kind of, frankly, what we do. We're also taking the opportunity though to change this conversation and make it less a transactional conversation and move to value-based care, which has been the core part of our strategy with all of our providers. So we believe that there is an opportunity to transition from just unit cost negotiation and volume-based discussions to value-based care. And our strategy is key in that context. So, we think that that's a core element of this, paying for outcomes and paying for value. We've been investing, as you heard through the discussion that we've had in tools that help our providers make that transition to value-based care and also help safeguard and mitigate some of the uncertainty that they have. So that's a core part of we think what's important in managing that. We're watching these dynamics closely. And we've been refining our high-performance, high value-based care model. So again, we think that an acceleration opportunity in our own business. We're strongly committed to digitizing and looking for end-to-end improvements across our business. We've been on a multiyear journey around that. We look at a number of areas around our own -- how do we improve experiences? How do we tie things end to end better? How do we improve our own efficiencies, looking at touchless claims, as an example, simplifying our pre-authorization processes, investments in better provider finders? So a number of the things that we're investing in around our digital transformation helps us in terms of our own internal cost structure, but also improves the cost structure of our trading partners, care providers and our customers. And again, affordability, we think, is critical in this environment in the scenario that we believe is our role and responsibility and are very focused on it. So, we have a number of tools or those on the provider side, really focused on value-based care and then on our own side around really changing workflows and digitization and moving much more aggressively into that space. So thank you very much for the question. I'd now like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased to have carried forward our momentum into 2022, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue to deliver against the financial targets we shared with you at our investor conference last year. Across our organization, we're accelerating innovation to advance our digital capability and resources simplifying our processes, improving our consumer experience and delivering products and services to champion a Whole Health approach and advanced health beyond health care for consumers at all stages of their lives. We're fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world and we're improving health by addressing consumer needs at a personal level, removing barriers to care and creating more meaningful connections across the lifetime of milestones and experiences. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Anthem, and have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through May 20, 2022.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Anthem is off to a strong start in 2022. In the first quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $7.39 and grew adjusted earnings per share by 18% to $8.25, exceeding our expectations. Based on the strong start to the year and the momentum in our business, we have increased confidence in our ability to deliver another year of growth in line with our long-term 12% to 15% annual adjusted earnings per share growth target. As a result, we've increased our full year outlook to greater than $28.40 per share, representing growth of at least 12.7% of the adjusted baseline we provided last quarter. It's the ongoing momentum in every one of our businesses, driven by the disciplined execution of the strategy we shared with you at last year's investor conference, coupled with the balance and resilience of our core benefits business that is allowing us to produce this level of growth. We ended the first quarter with medical membership of 7.5% year-over-year to 46.8 million members, widening Anthem's lead as the largest insurer by U.S. medical membership. In recent years, Anthem has been on a journey to transform from a traditional health insurance company to a lifetime trusted health partner, by focusing on whole health, addressing the physical, behavioral and social drivers that we know are critical to achieving optimal health. Our results demonstrate that our employer, consumer and state partners are universally looking for solutions that address underlying drivers of cost, while enhancing and simplifying the consumer experience. We are delivering in these areas and its propelling strong organic membership growth in each of our benefits businesses, in addition to creating opportunities to scale our service divisions. Last quarter, we shared that Anthem produced its strongest national account selling season in the history of the Company. Today, you can see in our results that commercial group fee-based enrollment grew by over 750,000 members in the first quarter alone, with a meaningful proportion of that growth driven by existing large employer clients consolidating their business with Anthem after working with us on a piece of their business in the past. Cost of care is paramount for self-funded groups, and the success we're seeing underscores our confidence in our leading cost of care position. Employers have come to expect more, notably in the way of enhanced experiences, and we continue to innovate to meet their needs. In the first quarter, we expanded virtual primary care capabilities to reach 5 million commercial members and expect to reach 10 million members by year-end. We're excited about the potential to expand access to care, especially in underserved rural areas, while offering convenient, personalized solutions. We also continue to advance client advocacy solutions and elevate our consumer engagement platform, Sydney Health, which has been core to our success in the employer market. Last year, we launched Sydney Preferred, a version of our Sydney Health app that allows employers to customize our engagement platform for their unique benefits and needs. Today, nearly 1.2 million members are on Sydney Preferred, and we closed the first quarter with more than 12 million registered users on Sydney, up approximately 40% year-over-year. Our commitment to Whole Health is also driving growth in our Government Business, where we are focused on health equity and meeting the needs of vulnerable members. Last quarter, we shared how our Whole Health index helps us better understand and address local, social and physical drivers of health. We're leveraging the tool to identify members with diabetes who may benefit from one-on-one virtual coaching, supplies and preemptive notifications to help better manage their health. In our diversified business group, new behavioral health programs, launched by Beacon, address family therapy, suicide prevention and offer a concierge model for members with comorbid conditions. All of these efforts support our focus on community health. Through our Whole Health index, we've been measuring Anthem's impact on health outcomes and are seeing encouraging, albeit early trends. Our health equity and community health initiatives that targeted vaccine outreach community health worker readiness, housing stability and diabetes management during COVID-19. Programs made possible by our deep roots in our communities were recognized recently by the Institute of Medicaid Innovation. All of this work keeps Anthem uniquely well positioned to serve the needs of our state partners and directly ties to our 100% Medicaid RFP win rate that we extended into 2022 with renewal awards in Indiana and Louisiana. Personalized Whole Health solutions are also resonating with seniors, notably dual eligible members with complex and chronic needs, and driving strong growth for Anthem and Medicare Advantage. For example, supplemental health plan benefits, like those offered by Simply Healthcare, address food and security issues by delivering food shipments directly to our most vulnerable members, benefit packages like our Everyday Extras, provides members the flexibility to choose which supplemental benefits matter most to them from menu of options. We remain on track to produce double-digit organic growth in our individual MA business, led by growth in duals. We also remain opportunistic in terms of driving inorganic growth through acquisitions. MMM has performed well since we acquired them last year, and we look forward to adding Integra, a high-performing plan serving high-needs Medicaid members in New York, to our portfolio when we close our purchase later this year. Across our organization, we're committed to accelerating value-based care, both in context of benefit expense for our health plans and growth of our diversified services businesses. We know that value-based care leads to higher quality outcomes, better patient provider satisfaction, more predictable cost for our health plans and by extension, more in our benefit packages. All of these factors can lead to higher star ratings in Medicare Advantage, which is a key strategic priority for Anthem. Over the last year, we significantly advanced our care provider strategy with investments and risk-bearing primary care providers and aggregators. This drive towards value-based care is one of the most important strategic imperatives inside of our organization. In 2021, more than 60% of our consolidated medical expenses repaid under value-based care arrangements, with roughly 1/5 of that or a low double-digit percentage of total spend in arrangements with downside risk. In the coming years, our primary focus will be to increase the penetration of downside risk sharing, including via global capitation. We expect to make significant strides in the coming years, targeting more than 1/3 of overall spend arrangements with downside risk in 2025, with significant increases in penetration in Medicaid, Commercial and Medicare. In addition to the benefits our health plans derive from value-based care, we see significant pull-through opportunities for our diversified business group in the areas of provider enablement, and carve-outs of specialized care management, including behavioral and home health. Beacon and myNEXUS are leaders in these areas, with the proven ability to generate high-quality outcomes and solid profitability in risk-based arrangements. Notably, 100% of myNEXUS' affiliated revenue earned from Anthem's health plans and 99% of Beacons will flow through risk-based contracts in 2022. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are making significant investments in our digital capabilities and platforms. We see three distinct benefits: elevating consumer and provider experiences, improving the cost and quality of care and improving administrative efficiency by automating manual processes. Adoption of our digital tools, combined with strong and rising customer satisfaction surveys, suggest that our consumers and care providers are finding value in our digital channels. Less than two years ago, we implemented live chat and AI messaging capabilities for our consumers and care providers to provide more choice and convenience. Today, chat is our best-performing channel for issue resolution and consumer experience metrics. Consumer chat usage grew by nearly 40% year-over-year in the first quarter, and now represents 24% of the contact mix. For care provider chat, usage grew by nearly 50% year-over-year and now represents 20% of our provider contacts. Meanwhile, Anthem is benefiting from improved efficiency, having reduced an estimated 1.2 million calls from members and another 1 million from care providers in the first quarter alone. Year-to-date, we've also made significant progress advancing our Health OS digital platform, which is now utilizing clinical data from providers and health systems for more than 20 million members. We use this data to advance clinical quality and elevated experiences by sharing more comprehensive data and insights with care providers and value-based care arrangements in order to facilitate better care management and personalize member interventions. We're also leveraging the platform to advance our cost of care analytics and streamline data collection for risk adjustment, all while automating processes that reduce administrative burden for our associates and providers. We're rolling this tool out rapidly with a goal of covering another 4.5 million members by the end of this year. In conclusion, we're continuing on our journey to transform from a traditional health benefits organization to become a lifetime trusted health partner and our proposed name change to Elevance Health marks an important milestone. Bringing together the ideas of elevate in advance, Elevance Health will reflect our position as a health leader, committed to elevating the importance of Whole Health in advancing health beyond health care for our consumers, their families and communities. Grounded in our mission and fueled by our bold and ambitious purpose to improve the health of humanity, Elevance Health represents the Company that we are today and will continue to be in the future. I would like to thank our nearly 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members who we are privileged to serve. Our passion to improve lives and communities is inspiring, and it extends to our own associates. We were pleased to once again be recognized as one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for, with a ranking of 57, up from 71 last year, on this year's list of America's leading employers and workplaces. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? Thanks, Scott. I'm going to have Felicia Norwood, who leads our government business, to address your question. Thanks, Felicia, and thanks, Scott. And as you heard, I think we feel really good about our Medicare Advantage, especially the start to this year and going into next. Well, thanks for the multipart question, A.J. We'll try to address it because there's a number of pieces in that, one about our -- how we're thinking about re-verifications in Medicaid, which right now, as you think about, we've said, with the extension, we're really looking for those to begin sometime towards the late part of the summer. We also believe that they're going to be paced over time. So, I think it's important to remember that the states now have up to 14 months to do the re-verifications. And as a result of that, each state will have a very different cadence of that. So, we do think that will be more phased in. In terms of your second part of your question, I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick to address that in terms of how we're thinking about capturing that. We've done quite a bit of work on that, and I know we've shared some of the statistics about where we see that business going. But I think Morgan can offer a lot more color on that business. So Morgan? Yes. And just a bit of a clarification, 35% really relates to the lives that were added during the suspension of redeterminations. So as you know, some of our growth is also the result of winning new RFPs and new entrants into markets. But overall, we feel good about the plan. We've obviously had this in place for a number of years. And in addition to capturing some of our own Medicaid lives and Commercial, we think we have an opportunity to capture other Medicaid lives that will be coming off the books. So again, we've been planning for it. We hope to see a very organized transition of this and that's what we're working for. So thanks very much for the question. And next question please. I'm going to ask Morgan to address the question on commercial. Yes. Thanks for the question. Overall, strong growth and we really feel that we had a really strong selling season. And as Morgan said, feel good about our positioning. So thanks again and next question please. Great. Well, thanks very much for the question. And I think myNEXUS is a great example as our AM and Beacon and some of the other assets that we have inside of the Diversified Business Group. When we brought myNEXUS into the family, the opportunity, obviously, to transition patients from the hospital to the home, we had strong expertise with them already in our Medicare Advantage business. But part of our goal is to do two things: one, to take our assets and embed them in our value-based payment arrangements. So as I mentioned, we have a number of those arrangements already that we're working on, both with primary care assets that we've invested in, plus also those that we're moving to value-based care. We see that as a downstream opportunity, but we also have an opportunity to capitate that business inside of Anthem's health plan and there's a huge runway for us there. And so, generally, we've started in our diversified business group first with a fee-for-service arrangement. And then as we get confidence in our ability to execute and do well with that, we're moving that along the risk continuum to cap, and that's a good example of that. It might be a good opportunity for Pete to share a little bit about how he sees what's happening in our diversified business group, and maybe even talk a little bit more about myNEXUS capabilities. Pete? Sure. Morgan, why don't you address that? Yes. Thanks, Morgan. I think, to add to that, he mentioned a couple of areas that have been really important for us. One is consumer experience, our investment in digital platforms. I mentioned Sydney Preferred has been very popular, along with our consumer advocacy model. And then the last area is our high-performance networks. Across all of the Blue system, I think we've done really well, and that's been a really strong validation of our unique cost of care position for the system. So thanks very much for the question. Again, really strong selling season and very encouraged by what we're seeing. Thanks, Lisa. I'm going to have Pete address that. Thanks for the question, Ricky. First and foremost, I want to say that we are looking forward to serving the retirees of the city of New York and extremely -- remain extremely pleased about have been awarded this contract -- have been awarded this contract. We've had a long relationship with the city, and we do continue to administer those benefits for the employees and our fee-based business today just as a bit of background. As you mentioned, based on the legal challenge, the city did not move forward as planned on April 1, and the city has appealed the decision, however. At this stage, given that process, we'll share more definitive information when it becomes available. As you think about how you should think about the financial impact, it's not dissimilar from what we said on our last call when we had a three-month delay at hand, which was directionally slightly positive as we're still incurring, as you know, run rate costs from being ready to go on 1/1, and that still remains the case today. So thank you, question, and we look forward to serving the city. Yes. Thanks very much for the question, and thanks for bringing it up. I'll just sort of start really at a broader perspective. Our care provider strategy is really a core component of our enterprise strategy, which is the integration of our Whole Health focus. And we've set a couple of key things. One, better outcomes we see by capitating and moving to more upside downside risk. Certainly, higher satisfaction, better and predictable outcomes from our health plans higher star ratings, which we think because of the alignment drives and greater stability for our benefits business, MA, our Medicare Advantage business, but also our Commercial and Medicaid businesses are a really important part of the strategy. Over the past year, we've made some very significant advancements in that strategy, particularly with our investments in risk-bearing primary care providers and aggregators, but we've also been advancing those that we haven't invested in around our VBC process. And that ties very much to our high-performing networks, and we're seeing growth there, as I mentioned a few moments ago. So -- as I think about those and your direct question, these are a kind of an early stage. We do see pull-through opportunities. So there's more than just your question about how does it affect MA. We see pull-through opportunities in our diversified business group, and they're resonating things like combining Aspire with those groups in their palliative care offering. We just talked about myNEXUS a little bit. And again, those are opportunities for us against to advance our overall performance at Anthem generally. As we move, we're moving very specifically to your question, to move to more capitation risk within the Anthem health plans. This year, we started some of the services like AIM. But our strategy again isn't reliant on a single model. So, I want to again reiterate that I've shared that in the past. As we see our value-based care mature, we think that there's a number of models in that. Specifically, about 60% of our consolidated medical expense, as I mentioned, is paid under VBC. That number is interesting, but I don't think it's the most important. The number that we're really targeting is moving upside and downside risk. We have global capitation, and as I mentioned, Today, we're about low double-digit range across our enterprise, with about 40% in Medicare in capitated arrangements to put some perspective on that. Our target is that about 1/3 of our overall spend in value-based care by 2025 we'll have downside risk. So, again, a pretty significant move and again, that's across Medicaid, Commercial and Medicare do you get a sense of the breadth of the strategy that we're deploying. So overall, feel good about the progress we're making. I think there are a number of value drivers across our business beyond just the simple question around Medicare Advantage. But clearly, that's an important one, both for top line and bottom line in our Medicare as well as our other businesses. So thanks very much for the question. And next question please. And maybe Morgan to comment a little bit about what's happening in employer decision-making? And thanks, Morgan, John, just to put a fine point on it, Josh, you think the strong growth that we've seen, particularly across the commercial business, is a really nice runway for us to add additional services. And that's really been the trajectory of our business over the last several years is continuing to consolidate employers and continuing to demonstrate our value first on the medical cost side but also on digital tools and other things that we're bringing to market. So, we feel good about the trajectory and the opportunity that we have. And again, very strong growth, and we're really pleased to see it. I think we have time for one last question. Yes. Thanks for the question, George. I think, first, there's no question that the labor market is tight. So as you think about inflation, we hear it certainly from our provider partners, and we see it in certain parts of our own business. Now let me start with the biggest bucket, which is hospital pricing. As you know, the majority of our contracts are three years in duration. So, we negotiate roughly 1/3 of those each year. And yes, there is more pressure on the system. But at this point, we're not seeing incremental rate pressure. And quite frankly, we believe our ultimate responsibility is -- that's paramount for our customer is affordability. So we have -- we're keeping costs contained to the lowest possible level and take that responsibility very seriously. It's really the core of kind of, frankly, what we do. We're also taking the opportunity though to change this conversation and make it less a transactional conversation and move to value-based care, which has been the core part of our strategy with all of our providers. So we believe that there is an opportunity to transition from just unit cost negotiation and volume-based discussions to value-based care. And our strategy is key in that context. So, we think that that's a core element of this, paying for outcomes and paying for value. We've been investing, as you heard through the discussion that we've had in tools that help our providers make that transition to value-based care and also help safeguard and mitigate some of the uncertainty that they have. So that's a core part of we think what's important in managing that. We're watching these dynamics closely. And we've been refining our high-performance, high value-based care model. So again, we think that an acceleration opportunity in our own business. We're strongly committed to digitizing and looking for end-to-end improvements across our business. We've been on a multiyear journey around that. We look at a number of areas around our own -- how do we improve experiences? How do we tie things end to end better? How do we improve our own efficiencies, looking at touchless claims, as an example, simplifying our pre-authorization processes, investments in better provider finders? So a number of the things that we're investing in around our digital transformation helps us in terms of our own internal cost structure, but also improves the cost structure of our trading partners, care providers and our customers. And again, affordability, we think, is critical in this environment in the scenario that we believe is our role and responsibility and are very focused on it. So, we have a number of tools or those on the provider side, really focused on value-based care and then on our own side around really changing workflows and digitization and moving much more aggressively into that space. So thank you very much for the question. I'd now like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased to have carried forward our momentum into 2022, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue to deliver against the financial targets we shared with you at our investor conference last year. Across our organization, we're accelerating innovation to advance our digital capability and resources simplifying our processes, improving our consumer experience and delivering products and services to champion a Whole Health approach and advanced health beyond health care for consumers at all stages of their lives. We're fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world and we're improving health by addressing consumer needs at a personal level, removing barriers to care and creating more meaningful connections across the lifetime of milestones and experiences. We'll keep executing with excellence and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Anthem, and have a great rest of the week."

            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "Yes, I would -- appreciate that, Gail. And I think Gail answered it really well comprehensively. I would say though, what you've sort of referenced a change in strategy, let me just reiterate what our strategy is. We're really focused on managing the complex and chronic patients and managing the complexities in health care more generally. And as Gail said, our primary client is Anthem. The opportunity is very fast. When you think about the complex and the chronic members and the spend associated with that population, you're talking about around $12,500 per member per year. Compared to an average commercial member, that's about $4,500 per member per year. So you can see there's a lot of spend there, a lot of opportunity there. And as Gail said, as we get more mature in the development of our assets, when you think about things like myNEXUS, we think there's a lot of opportunity to actually grow the portfolio. Yes, it is known towards UM capabilities and its access to care capabilities in terms of managing home care, but we see a lot of natural extension opportunities. So for example, we're very focused on post-acute care. We're very focused on DME as an opportunity. We're focused on social determinants of health. These are all areas in that complex and chronic category, where we can ultimately take risk and drive more value for our health plan businesses, creating predictable and stable cost of care, but then importantly, generating value in the DBG and incremental value for Anthem overall. Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Lisa. First of all, we're really pleased with our progress and growth occurring in the pharmacy business. We're encouraged by what we're seeing and we saw through Q1 '22 in terms of the receptivity in the marketplace around IngenioRx around our integrated offering as we penetrate Anthem's ASO commercial business. In fact, we saw about a 300% year-over-year improvement in the members sold when you compare Q1 of '21 to Q1 of '22. And I do want to point out where we're seeing a really good traction, that's in the middle market and down market, where I think Anthem has a lot of strength. And we create a lot of value. So a really good place for us to be. As it relates to our operating game performance and the differences there, Q1 '21 over Q1 '22, it's really completely explained by a one-time positive reconciliation item that we mentioned previously in '21. Without that, we're completely on track. We remain confident in achieving our '22 operating gain expectations and our growth expectations."

            "content": "So, good morning, Scott, and thank you for the question. With respect to the CMS final notice, the expected rate increase, excluding CMS' estimate of coding trend, was 4.88%, which was certainly better than we expected. We're also very pleased with the progress that we've made in stars, last October, which will have approximately 73% of our members and plans set up four stars are higher in the payment year for 2023, which is up from 58% in payment year 2022. So, coupled with the positive proposed rate increase from CMS, we think that 2023 is shaping up well. Our plans have stayed competitive as we focus on supplemental benefits to address whole person health and believe we will continue to remain competitive. So, all things considered, we would expect our Medicare margins to be inside of our target range. And we would expect another predictably competitive year with respect to Medicare Advantage."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned, we delivered strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $7.39 and adjusted earnings per share of $8.25, reflecting growth of approximately 18% year-over-year. Our first quarter results demonstrate continued momentum across all of our businesses, driven by the execution of our enterprise strategy, the benefits of investments in key capabilities and the balance and resilience of our core benefits business. We ended the first quarter with 46.8 million members, up 3.3 million or 7.5% year-over-year with nearly 3/4 of the growth being organic. In fact, we generated organic growth in each of our Medicaid, Medicare, commercial risk and commercial fee-based businesses. Membership grew by 1.4 million lives in the quarter alone, driven by the strongest national account selling season in Anthem's history and aided by the acquisition of Ohio Medicaid members from Advantage. Commercial membership is off to an especially strong start this year as Anthem's integrated solutions, which focus on Whole Health, the customer experience and total cost of care continue to resonate in the employer market. Our brand value and unique product offering, leveraging our deep local roots and value-based provider partnerships, also continued to gain traction with consumers. For example, in the ACA exchange market, we delivered individual membership growth of 8% in the quarter or 12% year-over-year. The Medicare open enrollment period was also consistent with our expectations as we remain on track to produce double-digit organic enrollment growth in our individual Medicare Advantage business. This includes strong growth in our dual special needs plans, where our strategic investments targeting specific benefit categories continue to attract consumers with complex and chronic health needs. In Medicaid, we overcame a significant membership headwind to start the year as additional carriers entered two of our existing markets, and we still ended the quarter up 319,000 net new members. In addition to continued organic membership growth, the acquisition of Paramount Advantage's Ohio Medicaid members in February added 256,000 members in the quarter. We are very excited about this strategic acquisition, which provides Anthem scale in Ohio's Medicaid program ahead of the future launch of the new contract we were awarded last year. First quarter operating revenue of $37.9 billion increased $5.8 billion or 18% over the prior year quarter, with strong growth in each and every one of our businesses. We earned higher premium revenue due to the growth in Medicaid membership, the acquisition of MMM and Paramount and the individual Medicare Advantage and commercial risk-based enrollment growth, in addition to premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends. We also produced strong double-digit organic growth in our IngenioRx and Diversified Business Group businesses. Our services businesses are off to a strong start this year as IngenioRx's value proposition is gaining traction in the market. The Diversified Business Group continues to execute on the strategy we articulated at our Investor Day in March of 2021, growing both affiliated and unaffiliated operating earnings across its portfolio of best-in-class assets. In the first quarter, DBG continued to grow its risk-based arrangements with our commercial health plans consistent with our strategy. With the risk transfer between businesses, we expect more seasonality in DBG's earnings with a larger proportion of full year earnings in the first quarter relative to prior years and a decrease in the seasonality inherent in the commercial business. It is important to note that this affects seasonality only. Our annual segment target margins for the Commercial and Specialty business division are unchanged. Revenue eliminated in consolidation, representing intersegment business, grew 23% year-over-year and represented 21.4% of benefit expense in the first quarter, up from 20.7% in the same period a year ago. Anthem's consolidated benefit expense ratio for the first quarter was 86.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the continued shift in mix of business towards government, which has a higher medical loss ratio. Relative to our expectations as of mid-January, when the Omicron surge was still peaking, in the terms of the at-home COVID testing coverage rule had just been released, our medical cost structure developed meaningfully better than our original guidance ranges, driven by a lower net impact from COVID. Specifically, the Omicron surge dissipated faster than we had expected in February, while producing lower acuity COVID cases relative to prior surges. This combined with the absence of any material stockpiling or abuse of free at-home COVID test, helped drive favorability in the first quarter benefit expense ratio relative to our initial guidance. Even with these positives, the overall cost of care in the quarter was still above what we would consider to be a normalized level. Anthem's SG&A expense ratio in the first quarter was 11.5% on a GAAP basis, a decrease of 70 basis points over the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by higher investments to support our growth and digital transformation. First quarter operating cash flow was $2.5 billion or 1.4x net income. Please note that we continue to expect to pay our share of the BCBSA litigation settlement of approximately $500 million later in 2022, which was included in the guidance we provided for full year operating cash flow of greater than $6.9 billion as we discussed on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. As of the end of the first quarter, Anthem's debt-to-cap ratio was 39.2%, in line with our expectations and well within our targeted range. Consistent with our approach throughout the pandemic, we maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 46.9 days at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 1.7 days from year-end and in line with the first quarter of 2021. Medical claims payable once again grew faster than premium revenue in the first quarter relative to the prior year. With respect to our outlook, we are pleased to have delivered a stronger-than-anticipated start to the year. Outperformance in the first quarter has increased our confidence in our ability to grow adjusted earnings per share of 12% to 15% in 2022 off the adjusted baseline of $25.20, in line with our long-term target. We now expect benefit expense ratio for the full year to be at the midpoint or in the lower half of our initial full year guidance range for this metric. Given the strong start to the year, we now expect to produce adjusted net income per share greater than $28.40, representing growth of at least 12.7% from our adjusted baseline. With the recent extension of the federal public health emergency, we also now expect Medicaid redeterminations will begin later than we had previously assumed. While the extension will enable us to maintain our Medicaid membership longer, please note that we will also incur increased cost associated with the PHE in our Medicare and commercial risk-based businesses for an additional three months. Importantly, Anthem is uniquely well positioned to navigate the end of the public health emergency and to support continuity of care for Medicaid members who lose access to Medicaid by providing a robust set of commercial offerings. The momentum we have in each of the balance and resilience of our core benefits business, should allow us to maintain healthy levels of membership, while continuing to scale our diversified services operations. Consistent with this strategy, we are well positioned to continue delivering against the financial targets we shared at our March 2021 Investor Conference. In that context, I want to point out that while we are excited by strong growth in our commercial business and the expansion of our risk-based arrangements with our diversified business group, the operating margin of the Commercial & Specialty division remains challenged by the net impacts of COVID. However, while the year-over-year margin performance in our reportable segments table includes the impact of the seasonality shift I mentioned earlier, the underlying performance of the business is better than the optics. Relatedly, we would caution against annualizing first quarter operating profit of the other segment, which includes the Diversified Business Group and the impact of the seasonality shift in that business. Importantly, the expanded risk-sharing arrangements with DBG have no impact on our full year margin expectations for the Commercial & Specialty Business. We expect commercial margins to recover as the effects of the pandemic subside. We also anticipate strong earnings growth in our Medicare business. These opportunities, coupled with the expectation of continued strong double-digit growth in our services businesses, Anthem's programmatic approach to M&A and our opportunistic focus on share repurchases, leave Anthem uniquely well positioned for growth in the coming years. With that, operator, we will now open up the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Justin. So in terms of COVID and non-COVID combined, as you know, that there was a significant spike of COVID in January and then it came down even at a faster rate in February and March than we had seen a decline at any point in time during the entire pandemic. Having said that, Commercial had the highest COVID cost in the quarter on a comparative basis, so Commercial COVID and non-COVID combined were clearly above baseline for the quarter. Medicare was next. And if you take Medicare COVID and Medicare non-COVID combined, it was still above baseline, but performed actually much better than Commercial. And then Medicaid continues to actually be the line of business that's performing the absolute best during the entire pandemic from a COVID and non-COVID combined perspective, and the total of those two are relatively close to baseline. So all in, the Company was above baseline, even though it was better than our overall expectations. Associated with commercial margins, we do feel good about the targets that we laid out in Investor Day back in 2021. As you know, we talked about getting to a 10.5% to 11.5% range by 2025. We've got a lot of things going on with COVID. It's certainly the single biggest factor that is causing commercial margins to be a little challenge this year versus prior years. And we also have some seasonality issues with our risk deals with our diversified business group, and that's not going to impact the annual margins at all, but it will impact certainly the quarterly margins. And Diversified Business Group, as I said in my prepared comments, I would not annualize that because of the fact that the shifting seasonality. And then Commercial, I wouldn't annualize that either because of that same aspect. So, we feel very good about the commercial growth and where we're heading as a company and the value proposition it has and feel very good about our 2025 targets. We're just challenged this year given -- or this quarter, the high COVID in January. But thanks for the question, Justin. Yes. Thanks, Nathan. I appreciate the question. We did end the quarter better than anticipated, but still above baseline, certainly, very pleased with our start for the year. However, there is still uncertainty, boosters, vaccination, potential spikes in COVID. But we feel very good about where we are right now. And with those unknowns, we still believe that we want to take a prudent posture to our guidance. With that, though, right now, we have a bias that our medical loss ratio is going to be closer to the midpoint to the lower half of the range. So it is an improved outlook from what we talked about 90 days ago, but still very prudent given the overall circumstances. Thank you for the question. Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll take that one as well. On the interest rates and its impact, you look at our investment portfolio we have about $35 billion in fixed maturities at this point in time. And about 30% of that $35 billion is in variable rate. So, there is an immediate benefit that portion of the portfolio gets from the rising interest rates. And then you look at the other half of the balance sheet. And as you know, we try to target close to a 40% debt-to-cap ratio. We're at 39.2% at the end of the quarter, so very much in line with our targets. And that right now is about $23 billion of the debt, and only less than 10% of that is variable rate which obviously will go up. So we're actually winning the arbitrage game from that perspective. And so the rising interest rates are actually a net, net, good guide to us. In terms of long-term earnings expectations, we're still very comfortable reaffirming the 12% to 15% growth rate in EPS that we've been talking about here since our last Investor Day. And I think what these interest rates do is give us a lot more flexibility in terms of decisions that we can make and be more strategic with those decisions here in the future. Thank you for the question. Thank you, Dave, and I appreciate the fact that you recognized that we've already had a conservative stance associated with our reserves. But -- our approach to reserves has been both prudent and consistent, and we obviously need to ensure that we follow actuarial standards and comply with generally accepted accounting principles. Associated with the first quarter, there is a natural seasonality aspect to the days and claims payable metric. And the first quarter has typically been a little bit higher than the fourth quarter on a sequential basis. And you can see that the last several years and that happened again this year. A lot of it has to do with a lot of new clients coming on, and we did have such a significant new sales activity. And as you know, we have 1.4 million new lives in the first quarter alone. And it usually takes a little bit of time for those folks to really get through to the doctors and get the manning and get all those claims paid. So, it's very natural to have a small increase in the first quarter. I would say that we feel very confident with the strength of our balance sheet and that the reserves that we booked as of March 31. They're very consistent with the reserves that were booked on December 31. So thank you for the question. Yes, thanks for the question. Certainly, we're very pleased with the growth. The admin fee growth is both a combination of the ASO fees on the fee-based membership along with the fee-for-service aspects of many of these add-on value proposition type services. And then, we -- as you know, on the 5:1 to 3:1, we're doing very well. We had about a year delay at the beginning of COVID, but we ended 2021. And it began 2022 at about 4:1 within that range. And we still feel very good about hitting 3:1 by 2024. In terms of the overall growth, I mean, look at the membership, I mean the membership is just going awesome, our best national account selling season ever, and that's obviously adding to the admin fee revenue growth. Thanks, Kevin. Specifically associated with the first quarter medical loss ratio, really have to look at what the situation was when we first provided guidance. The Omicron variant was peaking at a higher point than at any time since the pandemic began. And the home testing rule adjustment issued, amongst other things. And so, part of the guidance that we provided at that point in time was having those facts in front of us. What would happen was is that February and then March had even a much more significant drop in positivity rate that we had seen for any of the other prior surges that we've had since COVID started. And then we're also very pleased that there is no evidence of any abuse or stockpiling of the free home testing kits that was part of our concern as well. And non-COVID obviously, went back up as COVID went down as this occurred at every phase through the pandemic. But all in, the cost structure was better than our expectations, still above baseline, but better than our expectations. And that really was the primary driver of the better performance in the quarter. Thanks, Steve. I'll see if I can answer both those questions. On the investment income, do not run rate our first quarter performance. And first of all, know the loss on the write-down of the assets was not part of that. The outperformance really to do with our alternative investment portfolio and some of the positives that has come through, we're very, very happy with that, but we do not believe it's run rate. And then associated with the seasonality and the MLR, again, we're very pleased with the strong start for the year. And we did raise our full year guidance to $28.40. Simple math will tell you, $8.25 is about 29% of the full year. Essentially, for modeling purposes, I'd say the current consensus estimates for the second quarter right now are a reasonable approximation of second quarter expectations. So hopefully, that helps. Yes. Sure, Gary. Good questions. On the medical loss ratio, we're not completely back to normal. There are still certain things associated with the public health emergency, where various cost shares are waived. The free home testing kits, even though they weren't abuse or stockpiling of those, there was a cost. They did cost. And we expect to continue to incur those throughout the entirety of the public health emergency. So we think the seasonality factors will differ a bit from historical patterns because we're just in a completely different situation. And then associated with the SG&A and the cost structure, some of it is also opportunistic spending of accelerating investments in our digital areas when we have the ability to accelerate. And our expectation is, is that with the really excellent top line growth that we've seen, clearly, top line growth does include some variable costs that will obviously be incurred above and beyond what had been assumed. But we feel very good about still hitting our guidance numbers for the full year. So, unfortunately, I don't think our historical seasonality patterns are a great proxy given the situation that we're in this year."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Gail, and A. J., good morning. We have done a lot of work. And if you think about the fact that the Commercial business, the Medicare business -- well, the government business in entirety, as well as our marketing organization and our government affairs partners have worked to build out a plan for when re-verification begins. And presently, we're expecting roughly 35% of the present Medicaid membership to stay with the Government division and then 45% of that will move into commercial group insurance, with another 20 moving into the individual ACA exchanges. Certainly, the commercial group insurance will be one that the employers will pick it back up as they begin re-verification. But on the exchanges, I think one thing that's notably important is we talked last quarter about a renewed focus on our individual ACA business. And looking at that business differently and more competitively, we've expanded the product offering. We've expanded the network opportunities. We've expanded the counties in which we serve our customers from 71% to 83% of the counties in our 14 geographies this year. So, we feel we're poised quite well to pick up when verification begins. And as Gail noted, that certainly will slide over a period of time given the 14 months that the states have to continue to work. But thanks again for the question. So, Matt, thanks again for the question. So yes, we've had a fantastic start to the year. We do expect that to continue. Certainly, north of 50% of our business, especially on the upper end, all of -- just about all of the national business is January focused. So we've kind of gone through that. The balance of the business will be the continued local market business. And we've seen a big uptick in our fee-based business, which is terrific. We see the next big tranche coming on in July. I wouldn't expect it to be materially larger than what we've seen in typical years, but we're growing that business nicely month-over-month. To me, the assets are resonating in the market. When I look at how the business is performing. And also the opportunity back to the comment earlier on expanding in account value, the 5:1/3:1 strategy is proceeding nicely, just given the actual opportunity with the fee-based business around stop-loss. Presently, our penetration, we've got opportunities there as well as our specialty products, pharmacy as well. So I feel really good about it. I wouldn't expect it to be -- right now, we've said that we would be somewhere around 1 million members, commercial business full year. And we have some attrition that certainly bleeds off through the year of the national business, but feel good about our position now and for the balance of the year is how it's setting up. Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. This season was spectacular. As John said, it was the best we've ever had in the Company. So I'll tell you, the business doesn't all -- the cycle isn't always the same. These very, very large cases, usually bid on a 36-month cycle. So certainly, we're not seeing the volume. It's interesting, we've seen some very early, very large 2024 prospects already that we're bidding on. But I expect the assets to continue to resonate and our win rate to be consistent with what we've seen in the past. We continue to build upon what we've done. And our digital assets are resonating quite nicely, our clinical assets as well. So, it's a bit early. We do have some wins already in cases and the volume differ by year and that's not inconsistent. So it's not unexpected. Thanks again for your question. Yes. And, Josh, thanks again for the question. When I think about the reasons for the win, it's basically two things it's economics and experience. And when you look at the up market business, let's just focus there for a minute. It's one of the things that's consistent is buying various levels of advocacy services. So it's a heightened service model on the front end, which is probably north of 90% of our business. That's part of complementary to the just base admin fee that John described earlier. Also, we think about the clinical model that's unique and more elegant connecting back to a higher order front end. That's another model that we've seen great success for in the national market. In fact, we launched in 2018 with Total Health, Total You. Presently, we're sitting almost 7 million members across both the national business and local markets that have accepted that product and enjoying the product and what it's delivering. When you think about where the market has kind of evolved to your point around what people are looking to buy, I mean the labor market is tight. Most employers look at their health benefits as a human capital strategy, and they're looking for these unique nuanced ways to have a better solution rather than just a health benefits product. Lastly, commenting on your comment around the -- your question regarding stop-offs, there's a big opportunity there for us. When you look at the penetrable market, up market, we have a very, very large percent of it. We've got roughly 60% of our business in the stop-loss business penetrated today. We expect that to continue and look for different opportunities to serve our employers through value-based arrangements where it's a pay for value. And we do find the sign-up or the employer uptake to be quite large when it's positioned that way when payment is received upon value delivered. So again, thank you for your question."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; Mark Kaye, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon, Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial Health Benefits Business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits Business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and year and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. Mark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered a strong end to 2023, demonstrating our ability to execute with agility and the balance and resilience of our enterprise. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62. For the full year, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $25.22 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14. 2023 marks the sixth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate with a compound annual growth rate exceeding the high end of the range. This reflects the ongoing execution of our strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our health benefits business. In 2023, we made significant strides building upon our flywheel for growth. Carelon has and will continue to add attractive capabilities that we can scale rapidly and sustainably over the long term. For example, just a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a company specializing in infusible and injectable therapies. The acquisition expands our capabilities catering to consumers with complex and chronic needs, who can benefit the most from our approach to whole person health. Infusion Services will complement our suite of pharmacy services, which today include a fast-growing specialty pharmacy business and our advanced home delivery service, which launched at the beginning of this year. Carelon Services is poised for strong growth in 2024 with the on-boarding of new clients and continued expansion of services provided to Elevance Health medical members, including the rollout of risk-based oncology products and Carelon Insights, as well as the launch of comprehensive Carelon Behavioral Health Management Services to address the whole health needs of Medicaid beneficiaries living with serious mental illness. Turning to our health benefits business, 2023 marked another strong year despite a dynamic operating environment. Performance was led by the optimization of our commercial business where our operating margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows which will continue into 2025. Commercial customers prioritize affordability, experience, and simplicity. And we're delivering on all fronts. In 2023, we launched a series of initiatives designed to improve and simplify the customer experience, including our associates' ability to better serve our members through the integration of AI support and natural language processing, which has significantly improved first call resolution. In addition to enhancing our claims auto adjudication rate, we're also broadening the use of AI to automate certain aspects of our provider directory and other administrative processes, which have improved data accuracy in consumer and provider experiences. Momentum in our national accounts business is a direct result of the unique and differentiated value we offer to large employers. We continue to consolidate business with existing clients, achieving excellent retention and winning over 75% of employers who ultimately switch carriers despite a smaller pipeline of new accounts for 2024. In our individual business, we positioned our products thoughtfully to drive profitable and sustainable growth, and we're pleased with our performance in 2023. We're looking forward to even stronger membership growth this year as we focus on maximizing access to care for re-determined Medicaid beneficiaries. Our relentless focus on affordable products, superior customer experiences, and simplicity is yielding strong results. After growing commercial membership by over 400,000 members last year, we are poised to grow by another 750,000 in 2024. Medicaid eligibility re-determinations remain ongoing and in many states have accelerated the re-determination processes. To date, over 70% of our members who lost Medicaid coverage were un-enrolled for administrative reasons. This is a challenging reality for many families, but we're encouraged that we are nearly two-thirds of the way through the process, with close to 30% of those un-enrolled before September 1st having re-enrolled in an Elevance Health product. Our research indicates that many un-enrolled members are facing barriers to re-enrollment, including awareness of the process and required actions to maintain coverage. To address this, we're executing an extensive renewal campaign and have reached over three million people with our omni-channel approach as we remain committed to supporting them as their trusted health partner. Despite accelerated membership attrition from re-determinations to date, our Medicaid business is performing well. Rates remain actuarially sound for the members we are privileged to serve, and we are innovating to meet their needs. For example, in 2024, we will expand our community connected care model into eight additional states. This program assists Medicaid members with their health-related social needs by identifying gaps and connecting members to support services in their communities. We will also launch a program in alliance with the affordable connectivity program, major wireless carriers and Samsung that will help increase equitable access to digital and virtual health tools. The program will provide eligible Medicaid members with a curated selection of digital and virtual health tools via smartphone with no data cap at no cost along with training materials and ongoing guidance on how to use these tools. Strong performance in 2023 allowed us to invest for the long-term. In the fourth quarter, these investments were concentrated in Medicare, where we remain intensely focused on building a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth. This includes improving our star quality ratings and driving profitable growth in markets where we know we can win over the long-term. Unfortunately, pockets of the Medicare Advantage market have remained hyper competitive despite a more challenging funding environment. While our plans continue to offer attractive and valuable benefits, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to address product sustainability, and as such, we experienced greater-than-expected attrition in certain markets. As a result, we expect our Medicare Advantage membership to be roughly flat in 2024 on an organic basis, but earnings to improve. Importantly, cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business continued to develop as we expected, and we are confident that the assumptions underlying our bids for 2024 are appropriate. With respect to Stars we have now fully implemented My Health Advocate our comprehensive personalized customer service model for Medicare. This has improved experiences for our members, helping them to easily navigate the health care system and their plan benefits. Early proof points reflect an improvement in first call resolution, a key indicator of future quality performance for our Medicare Advantage plans. We are confident that we have a solid foundation in our health benefits business, from which we will grow Carelon for the long-term with many of the building blocks in place to accelerate our enterprise flywheel for growth. We are positioned to deliver another year of strong earnings growth in line with our long-term target in 2024, while continuing to invest in our future. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than $37.10 this year, reflecting growth of at least 12% over 2023. Finally, advancing Health Equity is foundational to our efforts to improve the health and lives of the individuals and communities we are privileged to serve. Our industry-leading approach received renewed recognition when the National Committee for Quality Assurance awarded its newly established Health Equity accreditation plus to 20 of Elevance Health affiliated Medicaid health plans covering over 90% of our Medicaid members and making us the only national plan to have received this distinction-to-date. We also saw excellent progress on our ambitious goal to improve maternal health equity by reducing the disparity in preterm birth rates between black and non-black communities, improving the disparity gap by 5.2% relative to our 2022 baseline. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our extraordinary team of over 100,000 associates. It is their collective passion and hard work that enables us to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. This past year alone, our associates logged over 225,000 volunteer hours in our communities, a record high for Elevance Health. This remarkable achievement reflects our deep dedication to making a tangible positive impact on the lives of the people we are privileged to serve and for the communities we call home. As we move forward, we will remain focused on serving our members as their lifetime trusted health partner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Kaye. Mark?\nMark Kaye: Thank you, Gail, and good morning. I am pleased to join you for my first earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. As Gail shared, we delivered strong results every quarter of 2023, including in the fourth quarter, which was marked by solid top and bottom line growth and significant progress in the execution of our enterprise strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our businesses. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62 and full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14 were ahead of expectations. Since 2018, Elevance Health has achieved a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16%, surpassing our long-term target range of 12% to 15%. Operating revenue exceeded $170 billion in 2023, up 9.3% year-over-year driven by growth in both our health benefits and Carelon businesses. The benefit expense ratio was 89.2% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the full year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points and 60 basis points respectively, compared to the prior year periods. This was primarily driven by premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trend, most notably in our commercial health benefits business. The adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.6% for the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points compared to the prior year period, driven by accelerated investments made in the quarter, notably in network quality, value-based care and customer experience initiatives designed to address key priority areas for Medicare Advantage stars. For the full year, the adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.3% flat year-over-year. Operating cash flow was $8.1 billion in 2023 or 1.3 times GAAP net income. This includes the benefit of approximately $300 million of state-based payments for 2024 dates of service that we received in the fourth quarter and which will correspondingly impact operating cash flow in 2024. We ended the year with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9% in line with our targeted range. Giving confidence in our outlook, we took advantage of market volatility during the fourth quarter to accelerate share repurchases, specifically, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for $929 million, bringing total share repurchases for the year to 5.8 million shares at a total cost of $2.7 billion. Our health benefits business ended the year with approximately 47 million members, a decrease of around 570,000 year-over-year, driven by attrition in Medicaid associated with eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by growth in our commercial fee-based membership. Today, we are seven to eight months into the Medicaid redetermination process. And while there is significant variability by state, we believe that nearly two-thirds of our members have had their eligibility evaluated. Of those unenrolled, approximately 70% have lost coverage due to administrative reasons. And we have also seen an elongation in the time some beneficiaries have taken to reenroll into Medicaid, while others have transitioned on to an ACA exchange plan. As Gail noted, we are executing an extensive renewal campaign to maximize continuity of coverage. Accordingly, we expect reenrollment into Medicaid continue through at least 2024 and for growth in ACA exchange plans to accelerate. This has been incorporated into our membership guidance ranges for 2024. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024. We are pleased to provide initial guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of greater than $37.10, reflecting growth of at least 12% year-over-year. We are focused on optimizing our health benefits business, including through the ongoing margin recovery of our commercial risk-based business, the strategic repositioning of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings in certain markets and the transformation of our cost structure. Further, we are investing in high-growth opportunities with a focus on establishing a foundation for sustained long-term growth. We will scale Carelon's existing capabilities and add new ones in 2024 and driving incremental earnings growth and accelerating our enterprise flywheel for growth. The momentum in our commercial health benefits in Carelon businesses is partially offset by the Medicaid membership headwinds included in our guidance. We anticipate total medical membership to end 2024 in the range of $45.8 million to $46.6 million, down approximately $750,000 year-over-year at the midpoint. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members with attrition driven by the net loss of approximately 930,000 members associated with changes in our footprint discussed on our third quarter earnings call and ongoing eligibility redeterminations. Commercial membership is expected to grow by over $750,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 32.4 million to 32.8 million members. This includes over 300,000 net new risk-based members and approximately 400,000 net new fee-based members, collectively driven by new business wins and strong client retention reflecting our resolute focus on customer affordability, experience and simplicity. Medicare Advantage membership is expected to end the year approximately flat. As a reminder, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to improve the sustainability of our product offerings. And given unexpected competitive dynamics in certain markets experienced greater-than-expected attrition. Nonetheless, these actions will help establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long-term. And we remain confident in the outlook for utilization and medical cost trends embedded in our 2024 bids. Finally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits membership to remain relatively stable year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, operating revenue for 2024 is expected to be flat to up low single-digits. We project operating earnings for the year to be at least $10.3 billion, reflecting 9% growth with contributions from both our health benefits and Carelon businesses, disciplined benefit management, and the successful execution of our 2023 business optimization initiatives. Please note that our guidance metrics do not include the impact of pending M&A, even though we have several transactions we expect to close this year. Earnings seasonality is expected to be relatively consistent year-over-year with slightly more than 55% of our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first half of the year and more than half of that expected in the first quarter. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors recently approved a 10.1% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.63 per share. This marks our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, underscoring our commitment to delivering strong results for our shareholders and the value of our balanced and resilient business model. In closing, 2023 was a strong year for the company, and I'm looking forward to working alongside the talented and dedicated team at Elevance Health to deliver on our financial targets. I look forward to meeting all of you in 2024. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Welcome on board, Mark. Congratulations to the company for another year of meeting the growth targets and I know it's early to talk about this, but maybe you'd have to take some steps today to ensure your positioning. With 2025, you'll have the Star ratings impact overcome. When you think about that, will the company do anything differently? How do you think about the levers you have to push to offset what appears at least on the surface to be a couple percentage points of headwind from that Star ratings impact? We step up share repurchases, accelerate investments in Carelon, how do you think about that at this early date and the ability to sustain that 12% to 15% even into next year?\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, A.J. There's a lot in there. And as you know, 2025, it's a little early to opine on 2025, but I'd like to give you at least a little bit of color on how we're thinking about some of the things that you mentioned. Let me start first with Star ratings. So because as we shared on the last we are intensely working. Medicare Advantage is a very important business for us, and we're strategically committed to the long-term. And I will reiterate this year, we felt we took very prudent actions for a long-term sustainable business and feel good about our bid. So that positions us well for 2025 in particular. In terms of the Star ratings, again, a few things going on there. We shared on our last call that on the group business, we have a number of levers at our disposal that we are able to pull, and we're still moving forward with that. And then in terms of overall Star ratings, we do think that, that's going to be a multiyear initiative. But I wanted to share, as I shared on my early remarks that we have invested at the last part of the year, and we were investing actually prior to even the announcement, we have been successful at moving all of our business into our Health Advocate model, and we do know that we're seeing some early signs. We don't know where the points are going to come out, but we do feel good about the investments we're making. And again, we feel really good about where our bids have come out. Broader, let me take a little bit step further back because I think your question around 2025 is broader than just Medicare Advantage and Stars. As I think about 2025 again, not giving guidance on 2025, but we do expect to accelerate growth in 2025 and we've talked quite a bit in recent calls about our flywheel for growth, which is in our improvement in both the health benefits business and our Carelon segment. We anticipate that our health benefits business is going to continue to grow in 2025 after a reset year in 2024. We should see an accelerated impact to that growth, which will drive revenue for Carelon. And then Carelon also has been independently scaling its multiple new capabilities, and we'll share, I assume even more of those on the call today. And then finally, as you know, we took some actions at the end of last year around our disciplined operating cost efficiencies, and we expect to see even greater benefits from those as we digitize and use AI in our investments. So honestly, I think we feel that we've positioned our business very prudently and that the balance and resilience of our enterprise and our earnings power of our health benefits in Carelon together gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. So just a little bit more color on where we are. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I guess I wanted to ask about the MLR guidance for 2024. It sounds like you guys are expecting margin improvement in MA, your repositioning commercial and Medicaid is dropping pretty meaningfully. But why is MLR only flat? I would think that we'd be seeing MLR improvement? Is there some offset in there?\nMark Kaye: Good morning and thank you very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the 2023, just to set the context here. So 2023 benefit expense ratio end of the year slightly better than our initial expectations at that 87%. And just to remind you, that represented the 60 basis point improvement year-over-year as well as falling in the lower half of our initial 2023 guidance range. As it relates to 2024, we are guiding to a flat benefit expense ratio of 87%, plus/minus 50 basis points. And our outlook here reflects a consistent approach to reserves and a prudent thought process around utilization, given the dynamic operating environment, especially for our government businesses. If I take a deeper look at the underlying businesses themselves, the health benefit expense ratio reflects that intentional management action we're taking in commercial. It will continue on through into 2024 around the disciplined underwriting practices and part of our margin recovery efforts. And then certainly, on the Medicare the advantage side, continued appropriate expectations around utilization and Medicare -- medical cost trends.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Mark, and thanks, Kevin, for the question. Next, question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more specifically around the growth in Medicare Advantage to start this year. It sounds like a little bit lower than expectations. And I'm curious specifically in the commentary you made around pockets of competition, maybe where you're seeing that, what you think is driving that? And then any specific comments on retention relative to expectations for this year.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks, Josh, very much for the question. And just maybe a couple of overarching comments because I think it's important that I'm going ask Felicia Norwood who leads our government business to comment more specifically. And I think it's important to frame that we made some very specific discipline decisions and feel really good about our bids entering into this. And Felicia, we actually exited some markets very specifically that were underperforming. So I think you have to take that into account. But she'll just provide a lot more detail on kind of where we landed this year and the perspective on the market. So Felicia, please.\nFelicia Norwood: Sure. Good morning, Josh, and thank you very much for that question. As we headed into 2024, we made some very disciplined decisions that we were going to enhance the financial performance for our Medicaid Advantage business. You know, in the mainland, we exited as Gail noted specifically certain markets that had been underperforming for us for years. And with the impending risk model revisions, we really saw no path to long-term attractive, sustainable economics in those markets. And that really represented a decline of about 84,000 members. I also want to note that, we reduced supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico, both to turn around their performance after a very challenging 2023 and to position us for the 3-year phase-in of the risk model revisions, which will have a material adverse impact on Medicare Advantage on the island, in part due to the higher mix of duals that we have in Puerto Rico. So, we've reset our supplemental benefits there, and in the midst of a very highly competitive bid environment, we will see membership declines of somewhere in the neighborhood of about 90,000 in 2024 in Puerto Rico. Now, while the decline is larger than we expected, it certainly has bolstered our confidence in the anticipated improvement in our benefit expense ratio in Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, what we wanted to do was to establish a very strong foundation from which we can grow in Puerto Rico long-term, sustainably, and profitably. Back to the mainland. Selling activity for AEP was actually very strong for us, as we expected. When we exclude the planned attrition on the island that we mentioned - on the mainland that I mentioned earlier. Our net mainland Medicare Advantage membership would be on track to grow by high single-digits this year, despite encountering greater dis-enrollment in certain markets, due to very aggressive offerings by select competitors. At the end of the day, I think that we've made very thoughtful decisions around how we're going to position our business for long-term sustainable growth going forward. And we've done the things that we've always committed to do. We expect to do very well in our Blue markets. We are performing better in our Blue markets than the overall growth rates, and we're very much focused on a combination of balancing that perspective between margin, and membership growth. So, we feel good about how we're positioning our business going forward. And as we said earlier, in light of all of these dynamics, we'd expect to have flat membership in 2024.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cancer Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. Do you guys have some really nice margin expansion guided to for Carelon in 2024? I was wondering if you could unpack it a little bit for us, as we think through the major buckets that are causing the expansion. And then also the pacing, if it's ratable as we think about the margin expansion due 2024 and then I guess, further out as we get to 2027?\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Sarah. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to comment on that. And as you know, we're excited about the real flywheel opportunity that we're seeing in Carelon. So, Pete?\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. Let me - thank you, Sarah, for the question. Let me talk about Carelon Services growth. And we are very excited about the opportunity and the progress that we're making with respect to services growth. I think you saw that play through in 2023. We committed to double-digit increase on revenue, which we achieved. And as it relates to our 2024 guide, you saw that we're talking about high teens, low 20s growth. And it's really playing through our strategy that we talked about focusing in on complexities in healthcare, high-cost spend areas, and really driving capitated risk in key areas, to support our health plans. In 2023, we did that with our post-acute care initiative, DME, wound care. And as we move forward into 2024, I mean Gail mentioned this in the prepared remarks. We have new offerings that are whole health full risk opportunities like oncology, assuming full risk in oncology, as well as in Medicaid with behavioral health with the seriously mental ill population. So, these are significant initiatives that are really propelling the trajectory of our business. I would also say that as it relates to external growth. We're also seeing really nice improvements from that perspective and really nice momentum. Our pipeline in 2023 or 2024 growth was much more significant. In terms of our sales this time versus last year, we've seen a real nice trajectory in our growth. And we've had a couple of really nice notable wins with the Blues. I would say that as it relates to that and the opportunity with the Blues. They are doing exactly, what we've talked about in the past, and looking closely at some of these full risk comprehensive offerings that, we're delivering in Elevance Health and then very interested in that in terms of the opportunities to create predictable stable cost of care for them. So, very pleased with where we are in the trajectory of growth in Carelon.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yes. Hi. Thank you. I just want to come back to the Medicaid redetermination process. So entering 2023, we're expecting some normalization of the Medicaid outperformance that you saw in years prior. Can you give us an update on where that landed in 2023, compared to your initial thinking? And then just a little bit more color on, what your guidance assumes for Medicaid in 2024. Does that put you back at historical norms for margins? Or should we think - should we be thinking about something else there? Thank you.\nMark Kaye: Stephen, thanks very much for the question. On Medicaid membership, our outlook reflects the footprint adjustments we spoke about on our third quarter earnings call and the continued attrition due to redetermination. We believe Medicaid redeterminations are approximately two-thirds complete across our Medicaid markets. And in general, we've seen more front-loaded disenrollment. Notably in a few large states that have elected to adopt accelerated processes. And then based on the trends that we've observed relative - or related to these market-wide coverage shifts. We have adjusted our Medicaid retention assumption, to be approximately 30% of our PHE related growth. We're not planning to provide point estimates for coverage transitions generally. We do, however, believe that ACA will pick up more than initially expected, while employer group coverage will gain a little bit less than initially expected. But most importantly, these updated projections are factored into our membership guidance that we provided this morning.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about your value-based care strategies? And what I would be interested in is, from a contracting standpoint, how are you approaching that for 2024 and like MA? Are you doing any sort of renegotiation to kind of hold those value-based care providers - more stable in that year given the risk adjustment changes? And then how is the priority for owning those sorts of assets in Carelon change? And what's your current outlook there? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Lance. It's quite a bit there. But I think let me start with our value-based strategy, we've talked about on this call a number of times, and I think I would say it's remained really consistent, but we're making a lot of very good progress on that. Overall, more than 60% are in value-based care. And in Medicare, it's even more. Specific to your question on renegotiation. We have multiple-year arrangements with our value-based providers, and we're always looking at a couple of things. One, quite frankly, to make sure that it's a win-win and we're aligned, both on cost quality outcomes and Stars. So, we spend a lot of time focusing on some of the ways that, we can get data back and forth more simply. We use our - we've integrated the way we share data back and forth. And that's really around closing gaps in care and quite frankly, simplifying the process under which we work with those providers. Our goal is to make that ubiquitous across all of our value-based providers. And so, we made a lot of progress there, and dramatically improve sort of the time, to action with those providers. And I think that's important because, honestly, that gives them data to act and that improves their outcomes. We have seen our value-based providers perform better in the circumstance, and we think that, that's going to remain important. In terms of our strategy around ownership. We've talked about that. We - as you know, we do have assets inside of Carelon. I guess where I would focus you more is around the specialty high-cost complex areas of specialty, because that's where we think that there's a huge differentiated focus between our technology, our clinical domain expertise and our ability to drive trend. Again, we don't need to own the providers, but we do need to have a significant role in the enablement of those care providers, and we have spent time doing that. We launched a number of new products this year with oncology, serious mental illness, and we're getting into other areas like musculoskeletal, renal and more. And I think - that's where you see the significant spend area is accelerating and Carelon with its assets has a great opportunity. So, we expect Carelon's care provider enablement platforms continue - to contribute pretty significantly Carelon's revenue meaningfully over the longer-term, and we're building those assets. And again, I'll keep going back to my flywheel, where we think that will improve the performance of our health benefit plans. There's a lot of interest in externally in these. And Pete mentioned, we saw some nice traction in a few of these offerings this year. So overall, I'd say very consistent focus around our value-based care - care enablement, and we feel like we're getting a lot of traction. And I would focus you a lot on the specialized care Specialty Care, particularly on the Carelon growth opportunity. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Two on the Medicare business. First, you talked about Medicare cost trend developing as expected in the fourth quarter. I guess, I'd be curious if there are any areas that came in higher or lower than expected and what the benefit expense guidance for 2020 - for assumes for Medicare cost trend? And then I guess, higher level, as you reposition the Medicare business, and I understand there's several moving pieces over the next couple of years. What's the company's current view, I guess, first of the Medicare Advantage market longer term? But then second, the membership growth and margin potential for Elevance, specifically within that market context? Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you for the question. I'm going to ask Mark to address your first question, and then I'll come back and share our long-term views on Medicare.\nMark Kaye: Nathan, overall utilization in the fourth quarter developed largely in line with our expectations. And that's evidenced by our reported benefit expense ratio, which came in favorable, as you know, to consensus and really to the midpoint of our initial full year 2023 guidance range. We did see pockets of high utilization, specifically in Medicare related to orthopedics such as knee and hip replacements and other outpatient procedures. But this is broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost trained assumptions. Similarly, we saw a seasonal up-tick in respiratory elements, including the flu and COVID as well as increased RC vaccinations. But again, utilizations were aligned with what we planned. We'll continue to monitor our claims trends closely, including prior authorization data. We remain confident that our Medicare Advantage bids for 2024, and our pricing commercial do reflect appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Mark. Nathan, in terms of your broader question, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. As I think about the market, we still think Medicare Advantage is a very good long-term market. And as I said, we're committed to driving sustainable performance for the long term. Medicare Advantage delivers really strong differentiated value for seniors. I think you have to start there. And as you look at the aligned incentives across the system to deliver better outcomes and better care - it is very - it's a very strong marketplace, and it continues to grow. And importantly, it's incredibly popular with seniors with greater than 50% of seniors selecting Medicare Advantage today. So that's - against that backdrop, we know seniors value stability in their benefits year-over-year, and the items that are most important to them. And so, we have, as you heard from us earlier, look to make sure that we are in this market for the long-term, balancing that stability. So with what we know is happening in this market, we can make the right benefit decisions and again, feel that we positioned ourselves, and are making the right strategic investments, to improve our performance. We see this business maturing, as Mark shared in his comments as well. And again, been very intentional about our desire, or decision to exit certain programs or markets and plans where we didn't think, we had a long-term sustainable path to performance. And that combined with the risk models, made that choice and then again, reposition Puerto Rico, which we believe is still a very good market, but there were some actions that we knew, we had to take. So as we look at those decisions for the long-term, as Felicia shared, our business performed when you look at the mainland and take out those exits. We had very strong selling season. Again, I think that's a testament to the value of the benefits and our position. And importantly, we do believe we can grow this business profitably even in a year with hypercompetitive markets in certain cases where we outperformed the growth in our Blue markets, which, again, has always been a strategy we've had, is to go deeper in our Blue markets and to gain more share with the value of our brand as well as in other places. So again, we think it's a good market. We know we have some work to do in that market, but we feel we're positioning for the long-term and think that we can add distinctive value for seniors as part of our focus on whole health and continuation of coverage to stay Blue for life and all of their coverage. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. I want to focus on margin drivers. Can you maybe just spend a little time talking about the progression in 2024, getting to those targets that you have in 2025? And then secondly, when I think about the margins in CarelonRx, you talked about them improving by 40 to 60 basis points. Can you talk about what the drivers are there as well? Is that Paragon Health and BioPlus, which I would assume carry better margins? Or is there something else that's really driving that improvement as we move into 2024?\nMark Kaye: Lisa, thank you very much for the question. I'll talk about health benefits, and I'll pass it over to Pete in a couple of minutes to talk about Carelon. On the health benefits side, we are seeing operating margins expand, or expect to expand by 25 to 50 basis points in 2024. And I think about this has really being driven by three primary categories. First is the continued underwriting discipline and the pricing actions that we're taking in commercial. 2023 really marks the end of the first full year of our efforts to recover margins from the pandemic era lows, and we expect those supporting initiatives really to continue through 2024, and then possibly into 2025. Second one, I'd call your attention to here really relates to the Medicare margin expansion. And here, as you've heard us talk about, this is about building that strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth in 2024. And striking that balance between growth and margin. And in 2024, we leaned a little bit more towards the margin and the growth and you see that come through in some of our outlook projections this morning. And then the third one, I'd call your attention to, is really the operating expense leverage, you see that we are gaining additional incremental leverage in 2024 with our guide down to 11.1% for the operating expense ratio.\nPeter Haytaian: Thanks Mark. And Lisa, your question was on the trajectory of the margins in pharmacy. So, you'll recall that this year, in 2023, we made pretty significant investments as it relates to the acceleration of BioPlus and Advanced Home Delivery, and that puts some pressure on our margins in 2023. That will not repeat itself in 2024. We did go live with BioPlus on January 1 as well as with respect to Advanced Home Delivery. We're really excited about that, and it's moving in the right direction. And over time, we've built those products for scale. And as that business builds and progresses, we will continue to see margin improvement. So that is, what is - delivering an improvement in margin in 2024.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could - just on the commercial risk enrollment guidance, if you can break that down for us, between group and individual? And then on the individual piece, I'm curious in terms of what you're thinking in terms of how much of that growth comes from the catchers - from Medicaid. And then, how you're thinking about the acuity of those lives that are coming into the exchanges from Medicaid. We know that in Medicaid, that acuity is generally rising as the re-determinations continue. So I'm curious, though, in terms of those lives that are transitioning into the exchanges - are you thinking about those as being sort of higher, lower, or in line acuity with the legacy population in the exchange market? Thanks a lot.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Scott. I think we've got about four or five in there. So, we'll try to hit the high points of your question. Let me ask Morgan and then Mark to comment on your question. Morgan?\nMorgan Kendrick: Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. As we think about the ACA business, we've talked about it for a while now. We're quite bullish on that segment. And as we've remarked in other quarterly reports, we operate in all rating areas in our 14 geographies where we can. And certainly, we've seen an expansion in the actual market share, and the market growth actually in these geographies. In fact, it's certainly a big driver is Medicaid re-determination. As we've indicated earlier on the call today, we've concluded about two-thirds of those. We expect that to continue in 2024. And also, as we've noted in the past, we've seen an elongated period of time from when someone is re-determined and when they actually join Medicare or come on an ACA product moving along. That said, quite pleased that our growth this year is outpacing our market growth. So clearly, we're picking up our fair share and more, quite honestly, of the Medicaid re-determined members. So at the end of the day, this will continue. We've had a very steadfast and steady approach around the right economics, and the right network strategies, to draw in these members. It's very important for the business to continue. And I'm going to turn that over to Mark to speak a little bit about the margins and the separation of the various pieces that you asked the question on.\nMark Kaye: Yes. If I think about Medicaid rates and acuity, the conversations with the states are ongoing. We'll continue to work with them and their consultants really to ensure that all adjustments are reasonable and reflect the risk associated with ongoing re-determinations in 2024. Our outlook for 2024 does assume a normalization of Medicaid margins. We already have line of sight into about 70% of Medicaid premiums for 2024. And we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the underlying rates, especially understanding the acuity for leaders versus stayers.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And thanks, Scott. And I think you also asked about the acuity in the individual exchange marketplace. So I wanted to just put a fine point on that. Our risk profile of the members we're picking up certainly in 2023, obviously, early in 2024 very much aligns with the expectation of what we've historically had. So, we feel it's actually rolling out, to our expectations. Thank you for the question. Next question, please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the Carelon margin question. On Carelon services, slightly down margins in the guidance. Just wanted to see if that - the degree to which that is associated with new risk-based arrangements, or membership, or to the perhaps to the new behavioral benefits and kind of what are the prospects for that, kind of ramping up beyond 2024? Thanks.\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. No, thanks, Ben, for the question. First of all, we're very pleased with the operating performance of Carelon. You saw that play through in 2023. I think we committed to 25 to 50 basis points of improvement. You saw 70 basis points of improvement year-over-year. So that it's performing really well. You answered the question already, as it relates to 2024, quite frankly. We are, as Gail talked about, and as I talked about earlier, launching some very significant at-risk product offerings, both oncology, seriously incrementally ill population as well as others, and that comes with a lower margin in the earlier years, but then improves over time. So that is precisely what was creating, the pressure on the margin in '24.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And just to sort of put a finer point on it, we do remain confident in our long-term guidance that we gave in mid to upper single-digit operating margin. So as Pete said, we think the business we're bringing on, is really good. We're committed to bringing in more risk business. But in the early years, that does have a little bit lower profile. But overall, we feel very good about the long-term. Next question, please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but a couple of numbers here. First, you reported $200 million plus of positive prior year development in the quarter, materially more than I think the company has ever seen in Q4. Just curious, given the MLR was generally in line. Can you tell us whether there were any pressure areas that work to offset the benefit of the PYD in the quarter? And then with the benefits repositioning of Medicare Advantage, which we've clearly done, do you expect to be within your 3% to 5% target margin here for Medicare Advantage in 2024? Thanks.\nMark Kaye: Justin, thank you very much for the questions this morning. We are confident that our year-end reserves are prudent and have been set consistent with historical practice. In the quarter, you're correct that we saw positive prior year development on a gross basis, and that was indeed favorable. It's worth pointing out here that that was largely offset through premium rebates, and colors as well as the reestablishment of reserves for the current year. An alternative way to think about this is that our full year days in claims payable decreased just 0.2 days year-over-year. And that's noteworthy in the context of the fact that we have observed cycle times to have actually decreased more than three days since the end of December 2022. And that should give you a feel for our comfort level around reserves. On your second question, just relative to the long-term target margin ranges, commercial is on track to achieve our long-term goals. Let's say, Medicaid is normalizing, but continues to perform well. And then Medicare Advantage for now is below our long-term target margin range.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on enrollment. I kind of thought the story for 2023 was that with the intentional commercial repricing, which has been pretty successful this year, you lost some commercial risk enrollment because of that? And I'm just trying to figure out on the 1 million plus decline in risk enrollment for 2024, how much of that is commercial risk versus the expected Medicaid redeterminations?\nMark Kaye: We're all pleased with the performance of our commercial business in the fourth quarter in 2023. We did make meaningful progress towards our margin recovery goals in the year. I'd say January renewals have gone well. We certainly experienced to date higher retention than we did at the same period last year. Repricing actions, as you would expect, do continue to impact membership growth, but this is expected. And so, we're really continuing to expect approximately flat membership growth overall in our group risk business this year, while continuing to improve margins in line with our stated goals.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. And just again, to put a fine point, most of the loss in risk membership, is driven by both the Medicaid redeterminations and the adjustment in the footprint that we've shared with you in the past. So, that really is the key driver. Next question please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of David Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDavid Windley: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to go to CarelonRx on the revenue growth side. High growth in 2023 low single-digits, I think you're expecting in 2024. I suspect the BioPlus acquisition inorganically would have contributed to some of that growth in 2023, but I don't think it bridges the full change. So maybe you could add some color around the slowdown in growth, the lower growth expectations for CarelonRx in 2024? Thanks.\nPeter Haytaian: Thanks David for the question. As it relates to 2023 and the growth of around 18.6% that did exceed our initial guidance and as you alluded to, that was driven primarily by the BioPlus acquisition and including BioPlus and our results to a lesser extent, drug mix and trends. But I would say as it relates to 2024, I would say we have tremendous momentum in the business. And we're really excited about how our strategy is playing through. We've talked about assuming the strategic levers that really matter in our business. We've done that with Specialty Pharmacy and BioPlus. We've done that with Advanced Home Delivery. You heard about the recent announcement of Paragon and infusion, which we're really excited about. And then there are several new product launches that are resonating in the marketplace that we've talked about previously, like EnsureRx as one of the examples. And this momentum is playing through in our sales in 2024. We are having a good season. Obviously, that activity occurred in 2023. Our retention remains strong. Our sweet spot does remain in that 3,000 to 10,000 range in terms of the business that we're attracting. And as you know, there's a little more reticence in terms of the larger jumbo accounts moving. But I would say that a couple of notable wins there. We saw a couple of wins in the 20,000 to 50,000 range. So, we're really excited about the momentum in Carelon and what we're doing strategically, and how that's playing through in the marketplace.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Pete. Our next question will be our last question.\nOperator: For our final question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yes, good morning guys and thanks for squeezing me in after Dave. I'm going to come back to MA margins one more time. And I'm going to ask you if you could expand a little bit if there is a way to disaggregate kind of the MA margin expansion thinking about your pricing initiatives versus utilization expectation versus mix, and kind of the market exits that you guys have targeted. Just trying to figure if you can kind of maybe rank order the contribution on margin expansion in MA from each of those four initiatives?\nMark Kaye: Thanks very much for the question, George. We are not looking to necessarily provide individual margin guidance within the Health Benefit segment. Certainly, we feel comfortable with where we're guiding to in aggregate for 2024 in the 25 to 50 basis point range. And we think that the qualitative commentary that, we provided in the call today should give you enough to get a feel for how the management team is thinking about this. Given this is my first earnings call, I just want to spend a minute on capital deployment before we close out here. And I just wanted to make the point that, I expect to continue with Elevance Health's existing strategic policy around capital deployment. As I believe it really strikes the right balance between growth, and the return of capital to our stockholders. And just as a reminder, we are going to target 50% of our free cash flow towards M&A, or organic reinvestment and approximately 50% is a return of capital to our stockholders, either via the 30% for share repurchases, or the 20% for dividends. And each year may differ. But over the years, we expect to allocate capital consistent with this framework.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Mark, and thank you to everyone who joined us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about our future, and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year. Thank you again for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through February 23, 2024.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered a strong end to 2023, demonstrating our ability to execute with agility and the balance and resilience of our enterprise. In the fourth quarter, Elevance Health delivered GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.63 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62. For the full year, we reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $25.22 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14. 2023 marks the sixth consecutive year in which we grew adjusted diluted earnings per share within or above our 12% to 15% long-term target growth rate with a compound annual growth rate exceeding the high end of the range. This reflects the ongoing execution of our strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our health benefits business. In 2023, we made significant strides building upon our flywheel for growth. Carelon has and will continue to add attractive capabilities that we can scale rapidly and sustainably over the long term. For example, just a few weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a company specializing in infusible and injectable therapies. The acquisition expands our capabilities catering to consumers with complex and chronic needs, who can benefit the most from our approach to whole person health. Infusion Services will complement our suite of pharmacy services, which today include a fast-growing specialty pharmacy business and our advanced home delivery service, which launched at the beginning of this year. Carelon Services is poised for strong growth in 2024 with the on-boarding of new clients and continued expansion of services provided to Elevance Health medical members, including the rollout of risk-based oncology products and Carelon Insights, as well as the launch of comprehensive Carelon Behavioral Health Management Services to address the whole health needs of Medicaid beneficiaries living with serious mental illness. Turning to our health benefits business, 2023 marked another strong year despite a dynamic operating environment. Performance was led by the optimization of our commercial business where our operating margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows which will continue into 2025. Commercial customers prioritize affordability, experience, and simplicity. And we're delivering on all fronts. In 2023, we launched a series of initiatives designed to improve and simplify the customer experience, including our associates' ability to better serve our members through the integration of AI support and natural language processing, which has significantly improved first call resolution. In addition to enhancing our claims auto adjudication rate, we're also broadening the use of AI to automate certain aspects of our provider directory and other administrative processes, which have improved data accuracy in consumer and provider experiences. Momentum in our national accounts business is a direct result of the unique and differentiated value we offer to large employers. We continue to consolidate business with existing clients, achieving excellent retention and winning over 75% of employers who ultimately switch carriers despite a smaller pipeline of new accounts for 2024. In our individual business, we positioned our products thoughtfully to drive profitable and sustainable growth, and we're pleased with our performance in 2023. We're looking forward to even stronger membership growth this year as we focus on maximizing access to care for re-determined Medicaid beneficiaries. Our relentless focus on affordable products, superior customer experiences, and simplicity is yielding strong results. After growing commercial membership by over 400,000 members last year, we are poised to grow by another 750,000 in 2024. Medicaid eligibility re-determinations remain ongoing and in many states have accelerated the re-determination processes. To date, over 70% of our members who lost Medicaid coverage were un-enrolled for administrative reasons. This is a challenging reality for many families, but we're encouraged that we are nearly two-thirds of the way through the process, with close to 30% of those un-enrolled before September 1st having re-enrolled in an Elevance Health product. Our research indicates that many un-enrolled members are facing barriers to re-enrollment, including awareness of the process and required actions to maintain coverage. To address this, we're executing an extensive renewal campaign and have reached over three million people with our omni-channel approach as we remain committed to supporting them as their trusted health partner. Despite accelerated membership attrition from re-determinations to date, our Medicaid business is performing well. Rates remain actuarially sound for the members we are privileged to serve, and we are innovating to meet their needs. For example, in 2024, we will expand our community connected care model into eight additional states. This program assists Medicaid members with their health-related social needs by identifying gaps and connecting members to support services in their communities. We will also launch a program in alliance with the affordable connectivity program, major wireless carriers and Samsung that will help increase equitable access to digital and virtual health tools. The program will provide eligible Medicaid members with a curated selection of digital and virtual health tools via smartphone with no data cap at no cost along with training materials and ongoing guidance on how to use these tools. Strong performance in 2023 allowed us to invest for the long-term. In the fourth quarter, these investments were concentrated in Medicare, where we remain intensely focused on building a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth. This includes improving our star quality ratings and driving profitable growth in markets where we know we can win over the long-term. Unfortunately, pockets of the Medicare Advantage market have remained hyper competitive despite a more challenging funding environment. While our plans continue to offer attractive and valuable benefits, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to address product sustainability, and as such, we experienced greater-than-expected attrition in certain markets. As a result, we expect our Medicare Advantage membership to be roughly flat in 2024 on an organic basis, but earnings to improve. Importantly, cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business continued to develop as we expected, and we are confident that the assumptions underlying our bids for 2024 are appropriate. With respect to Stars we have now fully implemented My Health Advocate our comprehensive personalized customer service model for Medicare. This has improved experiences for our members, helping them to easily navigate the health care system and their plan benefits. Early proof points reflect an improvement in first call resolution, a key indicator of future quality performance for our Medicare Advantage plans. We are confident that we have a solid foundation in our health benefits business, from which we will grow Carelon for the long-term with many of the building blocks in place to accelerate our enterprise flywheel for growth. We are positioned to deliver another year of strong earnings growth in line with our long-term target in 2024, while continuing to invest in our future. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be greater than $37.10 this year, reflecting growth of at least 12% over 2023. Finally, advancing Health Equity is foundational to our efforts to improve the health and lives of the individuals and communities we are privileged to serve. Our industry-leading approach received renewed recognition when the National Committee for Quality Assurance awarded its newly established Health Equity accreditation plus to 20 of Elevance Health affiliated Medicaid health plans covering over 90% of our Medicaid members and making us the only national plan to have received this distinction-to-date. We also saw excellent progress on our ambitious goal to improve maternal health equity by reducing the disparity in preterm birth rates between black and non-black communities, improving the disparity gap by 5.2% relative to our 2022 baseline. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to our extraordinary team of over 100,000 associates. It is their collective passion and hard work that enables us to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. This past year alone, our associates logged over 225,000 volunteer hours in our communities, a record high for Elevance Health. This remarkable achievement reflects our deep dedication to making a tangible positive impact on the lives of the people we are privileged to serve and for the communities we call home. As we move forward, we will remain focused on serving our members as their lifetime trusted health partner. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Mark Kaye. Mark? Well, thanks for the question, A.J. There's a lot in there. And as you know, 2025, it's a little early to opine on 2025, but I'd like to give you at least a little bit of color on how we're thinking about some of the things that you mentioned. Let me start first with Star ratings. So because as we shared on the last we are intensely working. Medicare Advantage is a very important business for us, and we're strategically committed to the long-term. And I will reiterate this year, we felt we took very prudent actions for a long-term sustainable business and feel good about our bid. So that positions us well for 2025 in particular. In terms of the Star ratings, again, a few things going on there. We shared on our last call that on the group business, we have a number of levers at our disposal that we are able to pull, and we're still moving forward with that. And then in terms of overall Star ratings, we do think that, that's going to be a multiyear initiative. But I wanted to share, as I shared on my early remarks that we have invested at the last part of the year, and we were investing actually prior to even the announcement, we have been successful at moving all of our business into our Health Advocate model, and we do know that we're seeing some early signs. We don't know where the points are going to come out, but we do feel good about the investments we're making. And again, we feel really good about where our bids have come out. Broader, let me take a little bit step further back because I think your question around 2025 is broader than just Medicare Advantage and Stars. As I think about 2025 again, not giving guidance on 2025, but we do expect to accelerate growth in 2025 and we've talked quite a bit in recent calls about our flywheel for growth, which is in our improvement in both the health benefits business and our Carelon segment. We anticipate that our health benefits business is going to continue to grow in 2025 after a reset year in 2024. We should see an accelerated impact to that growth, which will drive revenue for Carelon. And then Carelon also has been independently scaling its multiple new capabilities, and we'll share, I assume even more of those on the call today. And then finally, as you know, we took some actions at the end of last year around our disciplined operating cost efficiencies, and we expect to see even greater benefits from those as we digitize and use AI in our investments. So honestly, I think we feel that we've positioned our business very prudently and that the balance and resilience of our enterprise and our earnings power of our health benefits in Carelon together gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. So just a little bit more color on where we are. Thank you very much for the question. Next question please. Thank you, Mark, and thanks, Kevin, for the question. Next, question please. Well, thanks, Josh, very much for the question. And just maybe a couple of overarching comments because I think it's important that I'm going ask Felicia Norwood who leads our government business to comment more specifically. And I think it's important to frame that we made some very specific discipline decisions and feel really good about our bids entering into this. And Felicia, we actually exited some markets very specifically that were underperforming. So I think you have to take that into account. But she'll just provide a lot more detail on kind of where we landed this year and the perspective on the market. So Felicia, please. Thank you. Next question please? Thank you, Sarah. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to comment on that. And as you know, we're excited about the real flywheel opportunity that we're seeing in Carelon. So, Pete? Thank you. Next question please? Thank you. Next question, please? Well, thanks for the question, Lance. It's quite a bit there. But I think let me start with our value-based strategy, we've talked about on this call a number of times, and I think I would say it's remained really consistent, but we're making a lot of very good progress on that. Overall, more than 60% are in value-based care. And in Medicare, it's even more. Specific to your question on renegotiation. We have multiple-year arrangements with our value-based providers, and we're always looking at a couple of things. One, quite frankly, to make sure that it's a win-win and we're aligned, both on cost quality outcomes and Stars. So, we spend a lot of time focusing on some of the ways that, we can get data back and forth more simply. We use our - we've integrated the way we share data back and forth. And that's really around closing gaps in care and quite frankly, simplifying the process under which we work with those providers. Our goal is to make that ubiquitous across all of our value-based providers. And so, we made a lot of progress there, and dramatically improve sort of the time, to action with those providers. And I think that's important because, honestly, that gives them data to act and that improves their outcomes. We have seen our value-based providers perform better in the circumstance, and we think that, that's going to remain important. In terms of our strategy around ownership. We've talked about that. We - as you know, we do have assets inside of Carelon. I guess where I would focus you more is around the specialty high-cost complex areas of specialty, because that's where we think that there's a huge differentiated focus between our technology, our clinical domain expertise and our ability to drive trend. Again, we don't need to own the providers, but we do need to have a significant role in the enablement of those care providers, and we have spent time doing that. We launched a number of new products this year with oncology, serious mental illness, and we're getting into other areas like musculoskeletal, renal and more. And I think - that's where you see the significant spend area is accelerating and Carelon with its assets has a great opportunity. So, we expect Carelon's care provider enablement platforms continue - to contribute pretty significantly Carelon's revenue meaningfully over the longer-term, and we're building those assets. And again, I'll keep going back to my flywheel, where we think that will improve the performance of our health benefit plans. There's a lot of interest in externally in these. And Pete mentioned, we saw some nice traction in a few of these offerings this year. So overall, I'd say very consistent focus around our value-based care - care enablement, and we feel like we're getting a lot of traction. And I would focus you a lot on the specialized care Specialty Care, particularly on the Carelon growth opportunity. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question, please? Thank you for the question. I'm going to ask Mark to address your first question, and then I'll come back and share our long-term views on Medicare. Thank you, Mark. Nathan, in terms of your broader question, let me just provide a little bit of perspective. As I think about the market, we still think Medicare Advantage is a very good long-term market. And as I said, we're committed to driving sustainable performance for the long term. Medicare Advantage delivers really strong differentiated value for seniors. I think you have to start there. And as you look at the aligned incentives across the system to deliver better outcomes and better care - it is very - it's a very strong marketplace, and it continues to grow. And importantly, it's incredibly popular with seniors with greater than 50% of seniors selecting Medicare Advantage today. So that's - against that backdrop, we know seniors value stability in their benefits year-over-year, and the items that are most important to them. And so, we have, as you heard from us earlier, look to make sure that we are in this market for the long-term, balancing that stability. So with what we know is happening in this market, we can make the right benefit decisions and again, feel that we positioned ourselves, and are making the right strategic investments, to improve our performance. We see this business maturing, as Mark shared in his comments as well. And again, been very intentional about our desire, or decision to exit certain programs or markets and plans where we didn't think, we had a long-term sustainable path to performance. And that combined with the risk models, made that choice and then again, reposition Puerto Rico, which we believe is still a very good market, but there were some actions that we knew, we had to take. So as we look at those decisions for the long-term, as Felicia shared, our business performed when you look at the mainland and take out those exits. We had very strong selling season. Again, I think that's a testament to the value of the benefits and our position. And importantly, we do believe we can grow this business profitably even in a year with hypercompetitive markets in certain cases where we outperformed the growth in our Blue markets, which, again, has always been a strategy we've had, is to go deeper in our Blue markets and to gain more share with the value of our brand as well as in other places. So again, we think it's a good market. We know we have some work to do in that market, but we feel we're positioning for the long-term and think that we can add distinctive value for seniors as part of our focus on whole health and continuation of coverage to stay Blue for life and all of their coverage. So, thank you very much for the question. Next question please? Next question please? Well, thanks for the question, Scott. I think we've got about four or five in there. So, we'll try to hit the high points of your question. Let me ask Morgan and then Mark to comment on your question. Morgan? Yes. And thanks, Scott. And I think you also asked about the acuity in the individual exchange marketplace. So I wanted to just put a fine point on that. Our risk profile of the members we're picking up certainly in 2023, obviously, early in 2024 very much aligns with the expectation of what we've historically had. So, we feel it's actually rolling out, to our expectations. Thank you for the question. Next question, please? Yes. And just to sort of put a finer point on it, we do remain confident in our long-term guidance that we gave in mid to upper single-digit operating margin. So as Pete said, we think the business we're bringing on, is really good. We're committed to bringing in more risk business. But in the early years, that does have a little bit lower profile. But overall, we feel very good about the long-term. Next question, please? Thank you. Next question, please? Thank you. And just again, to put a fine point, most of the loss in risk membership, is driven by both the Medicaid redeterminations and the adjustment in the footprint that we've shared with you in the past. So, that really is the key driver. Next question please? Thank you, Pete. Our next question will be our last question. Thank you, Mark, and thank you to everyone who joined us. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered another strong year in 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about our future, and we look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year. Thank you again for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week."

            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "Yes. Let me - thank you, Sarah, for the question. Let me talk about Carelon Services growth. And we are very excited about the opportunity and the progress that we're making with respect to services growth. I think you saw that play through in 2023. We committed to double-digit increase on revenue, which we achieved. And as it relates to our 2024 guide, you saw that we're talking about high teens, low 20s growth. And it's really playing through our strategy that we talked about focusing in on complexities in healthcare, high-cost spend areas, and really driving capitated risk in key areas, to support our health plans. In 2023, we did that with our post-acute care initiative, DME, wound care. And as we move forward into 2024, I mean Gail mentioned this in the prepared remarks. We have new offerings that are whole health full risk opportunities like oncology, assuming full risk in oncology, as well as in Medicaid with behavioral health with the seriously mental ill population. So, these are significant initiatives that are really propelling the trajectory of our business. I would also say that as it relates to external growth. We're also seeing really nice improvements from that perspective and really nice momentum. Our pipeline in 2023 or 2024 growth was much more significant. In terms of our sales this time versus last year, we've seen a real nice trajectory in our growth. And we've had a couple of really nice notable wins with the Blues. I would say that as it relates to that and the opportunity with the Blues. They are doing exactly, what we've talked about in the past, and looking closely at some of these full risk comprehensive offerings that, we're delivering in Elevance Health and then very interested in that in terms of the opportunities to create predictable stable cost of care for them. So, very pleased with where we are in the trajectory of growth in Carelon. Thanks Mark. And Lisa, your question was on the trajectory of the margins in pharmacy. So, you'll recall that this year, in 2023, we made pretty significant investments as it relates to the acceleration of BioPlus and Advanced Home Delivery, and that puts some pressure on our margins in 2023. That will not repeat itself in 2024. We did go live with BioPlus on January 1 as well as with respect to Advanced Home Delivery. We're really excited about that, and it's moving in the right direction. And over time, we've built those products for scale. And as that business builds and progresses, we will continue to see margin improvement. So that is, what is - delivering an improvement in margin in 2024. Yes. No, thanks, Ben, for the question. First of all, we're very pleased with the operating performance of Carelon. You saw that play through in 2023. I think we committed to 25 to 50 basis points of improvement. You saw 70 basis points of improvement year-over-year. So that it's performing really well. You answered the question already, as it relates to 2024, quite frankly. We are, as Gail talked about, and as I talked about earlier, launching some very significant at-risk product offerings, both oncology, seriously incrementally ill population as well as others, and that comes with a lower margin in the earlier years, but then improves over time. So that is precisely what was creating, the pressure on the margin in '24. Thanks David for the question. As it relates to 2023 and the growth of around 18.6% that did exceed our initial guidance and as you alluded to, that was driven primarily by the BioPlus acquisition and including BioPlus and our results to a lesser extent, drug mix and trends. But I would say as it relates to 2024, I would say we have tremendous momentum in the business. And we're really excited about how our strategy is playing through. We've talked about assuming the strategic levers that really matter in our business. We've done that with Specialty Pharmacy and BioPlus. We've done that with Advanced Home Delivery. You heard about the recent announcement of Paragon and infusion, which we're really excited about. And then there are several new product launches that are resonating in the marketplace that we've talked about previously, like EnsureRx as one of the examples. And this momentum is playing through in our sales in 2024. We are having a good season. Obviously, that activity occurred in 2023. Our retention remains strong. Our sweet spot does remain in that 3,000 to 10,000 range in terms of the business that we're attracting. And as you know, there's a little more reticence in terms of the larger jumbo accounts moving. But I would say that a couple of notable wins there. We saw a couple of wins in the 20,000 to 50,000 range. So, we're really excited about the momentum in Carelon and what we're doing strategically, and how that's playing through in the marketplace."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "Sure. Good morning, Josh, and thank you very much for that question. As we headed into 2024, we made some very disciplined decisions that we were going to enhance the financial performance for our Medicaid Advantage business. You know, in the mainland, we exited as Gail noted specifically certain markets that had been underperforming for us for years. And with the impending risk model revisions, we really saw no path to long-term attractive, sustainable economics in those markets. And that really represented a decline of about 84,000 members. I also want to note that, we reduced supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico, both to turn around their performance after a very challenging 2023 and to position us for the 3-year phase-in of the risk model revisions, which will have a material adverse impact on Medicare Advantage on the island, in part due to the higher mix of duals that we have in Puerto Rico. So, we've reset our supplemental benefits there, and in the midst of a very highly competitive bid environment, we will see membership declines of somewhere in the neighborhood of about 90,000 in 2024 in Puerto Rico. Now, while the decline is larger than we expected, it certainly has bolstered our confidence in the anticipated improvement in our benefit expense ratio in Puerto Rico. At the end of the day, what we wanted to do was to establish a very strong foundation from which we can grow in Puerto Rico long-term, sustainably, and profitably. Back to the mainland. Selling activity for AEP was actually very strong for us, as we expected. When we exclude the planned attrition on the island that we mentioned - on the mainland that I mentioned earlier. Our net mainland Medicare Advantage membership would be on track to grow by high single-digits this year, despite encountering greater dis-enrollment in certain markets, due to very aggressive offerings by select competitors. At the end of the day, I think that we've made very thoughtful decisions around how we're going to position our business for long-term sustainable growth going forward. And we've done the things that we've always committed to do. We expect to do very well in our Blue markets. We are performing better in our Blue markets than the overall growth rates, and we're very much focused on a combination of balancing that perspective between margin, and membership growth. So, we feel good about how we're positioning our business going forward. And as we said earlier, in light of all of these dynamics, we'd expect to have flat membership in 2024."

            "name": "Morgan Kendrick",
            "content": "Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. As we think about the ACA business, we've talked about it for a while now. We're quite bullish on that segment. And as we've remarked in other quarterly reports, we operate in all rating areas in our 14 geographies where we can. And certainly, we've seen an expansion in the actual market share, and the market growth actually in these geographies. In fact, it's certainly a big driver is Medicaid re-determination. As we've indicated earlier on the call today, we've concluded about two-thirds of those. We expect that to continue in 2024. And also, as we've noted in the past, we've seen an elongated period of time from when someone is re-determined and when they actually join Medicare or come on an ACA product moving along. That said, quite pleased that our growth this year is outpacing our market growth. So clearly, we're picking up our fair share and more, quite honestly, of the Medicaid re-determined members. So at the end of the day, this will continue. We've had a very steadfast and steady approach around the right economics, and the right network strategies, to draw in these members. It's very important for the business to continue. And I'm going to turn that over to Mark to speak a little bit about the margins and the separation of the various pieces that you asked the question on."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Mark Kaye",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning. I am pleased to join you for my first earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. As Gail shared, we delivered strong results every quarter of 2023, including in the fourth quarter, which was marked by solid top and bottom line growth and significant progress in the execution of our enterprise strategy to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our businesses. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.62 and full year adjusted diluted earnings per share of $33.14 were ahead of expectations. Since 2018, Elevance Health has achieved a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16%, surpassing our long-term target range of 12% to 15%. Operating revenue exceeded $170 billion in 2023, up 9.3% year-over-year driven by growth in both our health benefits and Carelon businesses. The benefit expense ratio was 89.2% for the fourth quarter and 87% for the full year, representing an improvement of 50 basis points and 60 basis points respectively, compared to the prior year periods. This was primarily driven by premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trend, most notably in our commercial health benefits business. The adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.6% for the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points compared to the prior year period, driven by accelerated investments made in the quarter, notably in network quality, value-based care and customer experience initiatives designed to address key priority areas for Medicare Advantage stars. For the full year, the adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.3% flat year-over-year. Operating cash flow was $8.1 billion in 2023 or 1.3 times GAAP net income. This includes the benefit of approximately $300 million of state-based payments for 2024 dates of service that we received in the fourth quarter and which will correspondingly impact operating cash flow in 2024. We ended the year with a debt-to-capital ratio of 38.9% in line with our targeted range. Giving confidence in our outlook, we took advantage of market volatility during the fourth quarter to accelerate share repurchases, specifically, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for $929 million, bringing total share repurchases for the year to 5.8 million shares at a total cost of $2.7 billion. Our health benefits business ended the year with approximately 47 million members, a decrease of around 570,000 year-over-year, driven by attrition in Medicaid associated with eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by growth in our commercial fee-based membership. Today, we are seven to eight months into the Medicaid redetermination process. And while there is significant variability by state, we believe that nearly two-thirds of our members have had their eligibility evaluated. Of those unenrolled, approximately 70% have lost coverage due to administrative reasons. And we have also seen an elongation in the time some beneficiaries have taken to reenroll into Medicaid, while others have transitioned on to an ACA exchange plan. As Gail noted, we are executing an extensive renewal campaign to maximize continuity of coverage. Accordingly, we expect reenrollment into Medicaid continue through at least 2024 and for growth in ACA exchange plans to accelerate. This has been incorporated into our membership guidance ranges for 2024. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024. We are pleased to provide initial guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share of greater than $37.10, reflecting growth of at least 12% year-over-year. We are focused on optimizing our health benefits business, including through the ongoing margin recovery of our commercial risk-based business, the strategic repositioning of our Medicare Advantage plan offerings in certain markets and the transformation of our cost structure. Further, we are investing in high-growth opportunities with a focus on establishing a foundation for sustained long-term growth. We will scale Carelon's existing capabilities and add new ones in 2024 and driving incremental earnings growth and accelerating our enterprise flywheel for growth. The momentum in our commercial health benefits in Carelon businesses is partially offset by the Medicaid membership headwinds included in our guidance. We anticipate total medical membership to end 2024 in the range of $45.8 million to $46.6 million, down approximately $750,000 year-over-year at the midpoint. Medicaid membership is expected to end the year in the range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members with attrition driven by the net loss of approximately 930,000 members associated with changes in our footprint discussed on our third quarter earnings call and ongoing eligibility redeterminations. Commercial membership is expected to grow by over $750,000 at the midpoint, ending the year in the range of 32.4 million to 32.8 million members. This includes over 300,000 net new risk-based members and approximately 400,000 net new fee-based members, collectively driven by new business wins and strong client retention reflecting our resolute focus on customer affordability, experience and simplicity. Medicare Advantage membership is expected to end the year approximately flat. As a reminder, we took intentional actions as part of our 2024 bid strategy to improve the sustainability of our product offerings. And given unexpected competitive dynamics in certain markets experienced greater-than-expected attrition. Nonetheless, these actions will help establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long-term. And we remain confident in the outlook for utilization and medical cost trends embedded in our 2024 bids. Finally, we expect our Medicare supplement and federal employees' health benefits membership to remain relatively stable year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, operating revenue for 2024 is expected to be flat to up low single-digits. We project operating earnings for the year to be at least $10.3 billion, reflecting 9% growth with contributions from both our health benefits and Carelon businesses, disciplined benefit management, and the successful execution of our 2023 business optimization initiatives. Please note that our guidance metrics do not include the impact of pending M&A, even though we have several transactions we expect to close this year. Earnings seasonality is expected to be relatively consistent year-over-year with slightly more than 55% of our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first half of the year and more than half of that expected in the first quarter. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors recently approved a 10.1% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, raising it to $1.63 per share. This marks our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, underscoring our commitment to delivering strong results for our shareholders and the value of our balanced and resilient business model. In closing, 2023 was a strong year for the company, and I'm looking forward to working alongside the talented and dedicated team at Elevance Health to deliver on our financial targets. I look forward to meeting all of you in 2024. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions. Good morning and thank you very much for the question. Maybe let me start with the 2023, just to set the context here. So 2023 benefit expense ratio end of the year slightly better than our initial expectations at that 87%. And just to remind you, that represented the 60 basis point improvement year-over-year as well as falling in the lower half of our initial 2023 guidance range. As it relates to 2024, we are guiding to a flat benefit expense ratio of 87%, plus/minus 50 basis points. And our outlook here reflects a consistent approach to reserves and a prudent thought process around utilization, given the dynamic operating environment, especially for our government businesses. If I take a deeper look at the underlying businesses themselves, the health benefit expense ratio reflects that intentional management action we're taking in commercial. It will continue on through into 2024 around the disciplined underwriting practices and part of our margin recovery efforts. And then certainly, on the Medicare the advantage side, continued appropriate expectations around utilization and Medicare -- medical cost trends. Stephen, thanks very much for the question. On Medicaid membership, our outlook reflects the footprint adjustments we spoke about on our third quarter earnings call and the continued attrition due to redetermination. We believe Medicaid redeterminations are approximately two-thirds complete across our Medicaid markets. And in general, we've seen more front-loaded disenrollment. Notably in a few large states that have elected to adopt accelerated processes. And then based on the trends that we've observed relative - or related to these market-wide coverage shifts. We have adjusted our Medicaid retention assumption, to be approximately 30% of our PHE related growth. We're not planning to provide point estimates for coverage transitions generally. We do, however, believe that ACA will pick up more than initially expected, while employer group coverage will gain a little bit less than initially expected. But most importantly, these updated projections are factored into our membership guidance that we provided this morning. Nathan, overall utilization in the fourth quarter developed largely in line with our expectations. And that's evidenced by our reported benefit expense ratio, which came in favorable, as you know, to consensus and really to the midpoint of our initial full year 2023 guidance range. We did see pockets of high utilization, specifically in Medicare related to orthopedics such as knee and hip replacements and other outpatient procedures. But this is broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost trained assumptions. Similarly, we saw a seasonal up-tick in respiratory elements, including the flu and COVID as well as increased RC vaccinations. But again, utilizations were aligned with what we planned. We'll continue to monitor our claims trends closely, including prior authorization data. We remain confident that our Medicare Advantage bids for 2024, and our pricing commercial do reflect appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends. Lisa, thank you very much for the question. I'll talk about health benefits, and I'll pass it over to Pete in a couple of minutes to talk about Carelon. On the health benefits side, we are seeing operating margins expand, or expect to expand by 25 to 50 basis points in 2024. And I think about this has really being driven by three primary categories. First is the continued underwriting discipline and the pricing actions that we're taking in commercial. 2023 really marks the end of the first full year of our efforts to recover margins from the pandemic era lows, and we expect those supporting initiatives really to continue through 2024, and then possibly into 2025. Second one, I'd call your attention to here really relates to the Medicare margin expansion. And here, as you've heard us talk about, this is about building that strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth in 2024. And striking that balance between growth and margin. And in 2024, we leaned a little bit more towards the margin and the growth and you see that come through in some of our outlook projections this morning. And then the third one, I'd call your attention to, is really the operating expense leverage, you see that we are gaining additional incremental leverage in 2024 with our guide down to 11.1% for the operating expense ratio. Yes. If I think about Medicaid rates and acuity, the conversations with the states are ongoing. We'll continue to work with them and their consultants really to ensure that all adjustments are reasonable and reflect the risk associated with ongoing re-determinations in 2024. Our outlook for 2024 does assume a normalization of Medicaid margins. We already have line of sight into about 70% of Medicaid premiums for 2024. And we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the underlying rates, especially understanding the acuity for leaders versus stayers. Justin, thank you very much for the questions this morning. We are confident that our year-end reserves are prudent and have been set consistent with historical practice. In the quarter, you're correct that we saw positive prior year development on a gross basis, and that was indeed favorable. It's worth pointing out here that that was largely offset through premium rebates, and colors as well as the reestablishment of reserves for the current year. An alternative way to think about this is that our full year days in claims payable decreased just 0.2 days year-over-year. And that's noteworthy in the context of the fact that we have observed cycle times to have actually decreased more than three days since the end of December 2022. And that should give you a feel for our comfort level around reserves. On your second question, just relative to the long-term target margin ranges, commercial is on track to achieve our long-term goals. Let's say, Medicaid is normalizing, but continues to perform well. And then Medicare Advantage for now is below our long-term target margin range. We're all pleased with the performance of our commercial business in the fourth quarter in 2023. We did make meaningful progress towards our margin recovery goals in the year. I'd say January renewals have gone well. We certainly experienced to date higher retention than we did at the same period last year. Repricing actions, as you would expect, do continue to impact membership growth, but this is expected. And so, we're really continuing to expect approximately flat membership growth overall in our group risk business this year, while continuing to improve margins in line with our stated goals. Thanks very much for the question, George. We are not looking to necessarily provide individual margin guidance within the Health Benefit segment. Certainly, we feel comfortable with where we're guiding to in aggregate for 2024 in the 25 to 50 basis point range. And we think that the qualitative commentary that, we provided in the call today should give you enough to get a feel for how the management team is thinking about this. Given this is my first earnings call, I just want to spend a minute on capital deployment before we close out here. And I just wanted to make the point that, I expect to continue with Elevance Health's existing strategic policy around capital deployment. As I believe it really strikes the right balance between growth, and the return of capital to our stockholders. And just as a reminder, we are going to target 50% of our free cash flow towards M&A, or organic reinvestment and approximately 50% is a return of capital to our stockholders, either via the 30% for share repurchases, or the 20% for dividends. And each year may differ. But over the years, we expect to allocate capital consistent with this framework."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] These instructions will be repeated prior to the question-and-answer portion of this call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's third quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; and Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Health Benefits business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another solid quarter of financial and operational performance, reflecting the strength and resilience of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share was $5.45, including a charge we took during the quarter that I will discuss in detail in a moment. Adjusted earnings per share was $8.99 and reflecting growth of approximately 20% over the third quarter of 2022. Our results demonstrate our ability to execute on our enterprise strategy of delivering whole health solutions that are affordable, personalized and simple. Based on our strong year-to-date results and confidence in our outlook, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $33 for 2023, which includes incremental investments planned for the fourth quarter that will accelerate our strategy and enhance the performance of our Medicare Advantage business. It is the strength and resilience of our diverse businesses that provides comfort in our outlook, while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon division provides us the confidence to reiterate our commitment to our long-term target compound annual growth rate in adjusted earnings per share of 12% to 15%. Let me now turn to some highlights from our business segments. Starting with our Health Benefits division, which delivered robust third quarter results as we continue optimizing our diverse set of businesses, while responding to a dynamic and evolving business environment. In our Commercial Risk business, we are successfully executing on our goal to deliver operating margins in line with pre-pandemic norms. Retention has been consistent with our expectations, and we're pleased with our progress, which we expect will extend well into 2024. In the employer market, we're delivering differentiated value where it matters for employers, affordability, experience and simplicity. Over the past three years, we've become the sole source medical benefits provider for 32 of our national clients, including nine additional customers who will be consolidating their coverage with us effective January 2024. For large employers, we continue to deliver differentiated value and are seeing employers move away from point solutions and slice offerings to selecting Elevance Health as their strategic partner for the integration of all of their medical benefits. Consistent with these results, our advocacy solutions business, which provides personalized guidance and support to help members both navigate the complex healthcare system and optimize their health and well-being will add 37 new clients in 2024 covering more than 550,000 members. This includes two large employers who are returning to Elevance Health after previously testing third party advocacy vendors. In the individual market, we are seeing strong growth in plans that offer affordable and comprehensive coverage designed around the needs of consumers in our communities, including those transitioning from Medicaid to individual ACA coverage. Year-to-date, our individual membership has grown by 27%. Through the first half of this year, the latest period for which industry data is available, our individual ACA membership growth rate more than tripled that of our competitors in our 14 Blue states. Our government business also posted a strong quarter. In our Medicaid business, rates are actuarially appropriate, but we are absorbing a membership headwind related to the pace of Medicaid redeterminations, especially in states that have adopted accelerated time lines. Nearly three-quarters of all Medicaid beneficiaries terminated in our markets to-date have less coverage for administrative reasons and 37% of the attrition from our own health plans has been driven by individuals under 18 years of age, many of whom may still be eligible for Medicaid benefits. We are doing all we can to ensure continuity of coverage for as many consumers as possible, working closely with our state partners to ensure individuals eligible for Medicaid retain coverage while also offering affordable ACA exchange plans in nearly all of our Blue counties. We are seeing encouraging signs in some of our Blue states where we offer Medicaid and commercial coverage. We have seen 30% or more of our Medicaid members who were terminated prior to the end of June, return or retain coverage with Elevance Health, albeit with gaps in coverage that can extend for several months. We expect re-enrollment to accelerate in the coming quarters as we continue with our omni-channel approach to outreach and engagement, ensuring our members are aware of their options. Accordingly, we anticipate the rate of membership attrition associated with redeterminations will slow considerably in the coming quarters. In Medicare, we continue to offer high-quality plans that provide seniors access to comprehensive and coordinated care, and we are committed to doing so for the long-term. We're disappointed, however, with our Stars performance for measurement year 2022, which is the basis for Star ratings that will impact the 2025 payment year and specifically, with our decline in consumer survey scores and the way in which CMS applied a new statistical methodology that resulted in significant increases to many star measure touchpoints. To improve our performance in future periods, we have already commenced investments in four primary areas: service, product, network access and operations. For example, in July of this year, we built on the success of our innovative advocacy model in the employer market by adapting it for the unique needs of Medicare eligible consumers. This new program, My Health Advocate is a comprehensive, personalized and relationship-based customer service model that enables our members to effectively navigate the health care system, their benefits, and ultimately, to improve their overall health and well-being. Furthermore, we have enhanced our core and supplemental benefits to reduce member's out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications, simplified our dental benefits and strengthened our grocery and over-the-counter benefits. We're also simplifying consumer and provider experiences through the automation and elimination of certain prior authorizations, accelerating our work with value-based care provider partners and improving clinical decision appeal rates. Collectively, these actions and the ongoing investments should enhance our performance in key star measures and ultimately increase member satisfaction with our plans. We are actively pursuing all our options and exploring actions to mitigate the direct financial impact on payment year 2025, including through contract diversification, operating efficiency, and capital deployment alternatives. We will provide updates on our action plans and progress in future engagements in advance of 2025. Moving to Carelon. We are pleased with our momentum in the business as it continues to advance its strategy of integrated physical, behavioral, social and pharmacy services to deliver whole health affordably. Carelon Services delivered particularly strong growth in operating earnings, led by the expansion of our post-acute care management solutions. We also extended our service offerings in adjacent areas, including durable medical equipment and wound care, further enhancing our customer value proposition and differentiation. CarelonRx continues to make significant progress towards the near-term rollout of multiple new capabilities that will enhance the affordability and experience of pharmacy for our members and CarelonRx customers. One of these capabilities is EnsureRx an integrated benefit for commercial pharmacy members. That compares the benefit cost for over 50 covered generic medications to our network of multiple cash discount cards then automatically applies the lowest cost at any pharmacy. The program launches early next year, and we will save our customers money while enhancing their experience EnsureRx will also capture claim data to ensure full safety checks and maintain the integrity of our data. We're also pleased with the integration of BioPlus, which continues to track ahead of schedule, and we expect to begin migrating specialty scripts from our legacy pharmacy platform early next year. Finally, we remain on track to launch our advanced home delivery capability in the fourth quarter. Together, these businesses will allow us to deliver even better consumer experiences and enhance affordability while creating additional shareholder value over time. Now I'd like to address the actions we took during the quarter to transform our cost structure and enhance our operating efficiency. With affordability of health care, a paramount concern for all of our customers and more uncertainty in the business environment heading into 2024, we took proactive and decisive action in the third quarter to increase our financial and operational flexibility and to ensure we will remain well-positioned to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, we completed a strategic review of our operations, assets and the investments we've made over the years to identify opportunities to increase efficiency and enhance focus, all while driving greater impact from our programs at scale. This resulted in workforce and asset optimization that will make us more nimble, focused and efficient and allow us to concentrate our resources on the most promising programs while further optimizing our physical footprint. The pace of technological innovation is rapid and accelerating, and we are committed to keeping pace. As we pivot away from some legacy projects including those tied to systems that are being replaced with cloud-based models, we are also scaling key digital programs for greater impact. One example is HealthOS, a key enabler of our strategy that is helping to change the way care providers deliver care, while reducing administrative burden. HealthOS is our digital platform for health that allows us to exchange data bi-directionally with providers in real time and essential to a number of our priorities, including our approach to value-based care. We are also in the early stages of rolling out new AI capabilities and large language models that are helping us personalize member experiences and automate administrative tasks. We're excited about the possibilities of the rapid technological innovation that is underway and are committed to continuous improvement, innovation and the ongoing optimization of our processes reengineering much of what we do while delivering more personalized experiences to our members along the way. Before I close \u2013 and are committed to continuous improvement, innovation and the ongoing optimization of our processes, reengineering much of what we do while delivering more personalized experiences to our members along the way. Before I close, I'd like to note that we remain confident in our ability to close the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana. We're actively working with local regulators and stakeholders to address any remaining questions. The deal offers tremendous value and opportunity for the people of Louisiana, including through the creation of a multibillion dollar foundation focused on improving their health and lives, and we look forward to the privilege of serving as their lifetime trusted health partner. As you will hear from John in just a moment, the balance of our diverse set of businesses, the momentum of our enterprise strategy and the decisive actions we have taken to enhance our operating efficiency, give us confidence in our ability to deliver strong growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2024. In closing, I want to thank all of our associates around the world for their dedication and hard work. In the third quarter, we were also pleased to be named one of America's greatest workplaces by Newsweek and the number one best large workplace in health care by Fortune. It is the work our associates do every day on behalf of the individuals we are privileged to serve that allows us to deliver strong operating results in service of our bold purpose to improve the health of humanity. Collectively, we are fueled by passion for having a positive impact on our communities, our members and the environment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John to provide more on our operating results and outlook. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong third quarter results. Given outperformance against our initial expectations year-to-date, we have increased our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 to be greater than $33, reflecting growth consistent with our long-term compound annual target of 12% to 15%. Our outlook includes incremental investments we have planned for the fourth quarter to support growth in Medicare Advantage in 2024 and beyond. Based on our updated guidance, our five-year compound annual growth rate in earnings per share is expected to be 16%, which makes Elevance Health the only company in our sector to have exceeded 15% over that time frame. We ended the third quarter with 47.3 million members, an increase of 42,000 members year-over-year driven by growth in BlueCard and ACA membership. During the quarter, medical membership declined by 664,000, driven by attrition in Medicaid due to eligibility redeterminations and a new entrant into one of our state programs in July, which resulted in a loss of approximately 140,000 Medicaid members. We are now three to four months into redeterminations of most of our states, and this enrollment in many appears to be front loaded with approximately three quarters of those terminated from Medicaid having lost coverage for administrative reasons. We are seeing many consumers return to Medicaid after being temporarily disenrolled, while others are experiencing gaps in coverage before transitioning on to ACA exchange plans. Given the patterns we have observed to-date, we expect reenrollment in the Medicaid and transitions to ACA exchange plans to accelerate. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $42.5 billion, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year quarter. Growth was driven by rate increases to cover overall trend in our health benefits business, coupled with double-digit top line growth in CarelonRx driven by growth in pharmacy customers and the acquisition of BioPlus. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 86.8% an improvement of 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year, driven by premium rate adjustments to cover medical cost trend and solid performance within our government business. Now I would like to spend a moment discussing the business optimization charge we announced as part of our results this morning. As Gail mentioned earlier, we took decisive action during the quarter to position our company for long-term success by enhancing operating efficiency, refining the focus of our investments and optimizing our physical footprint. These actions will ensure we stay well positioned to provide affordable products while delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. As a result of this strategic review, we incurred a business optimization charge of approximately $700 million, comprised of write-offs and write-downs of internally developed software and related assets, severance and leases associated with optimizing our physical footprint. These actions will result in gross annual run rate operating expense savings of approximately $750 million per year, a portion of which will be reinvested in growth opportunities, including Medicare Advantage and the accelerated rollout of certain digital capabilities. We are committed to doing even better and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance operating efficiency further. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio in the third quarter was 11.1%, and a decrease of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. However, the third quarter last year included additional out-of-period quality improvement expenses due to the accounting realignment we announced then. Excluding out-of-period quality improvement expenses in the third quarter of last year, our adjusted operating expense ratio would have been unchanged. Adjusted operating gain for the enterprise grew 12.6%, led by our Health Benefits business, which delivered double-digit growth as we continue to optimize premium rates and products while enhancing operating efficiency across the segment. Operating margin for our Health Benefits improved by 30 basis points year-over-year consistent with our expectations. Carelon also delivered a strong quarter with growth in pharmacy growth in pharmacy customers and the acquisition of BioPlus propelling CarelonRx to 17.5% revenue growth. CarelonRx operating earnings included investments to support the build-out of our specialty pharmacy and advanced home delivery capabilities both of which will ramp up in the coming months. In addition, comparisons to the third quarter of 2022 have been negatively affected by the out-of-period fee-based revenue realized in the third quarter of last year. In Carelon Services, strong growth in operating earnings was driven by expansion of Carelon post-acute solutions and growth in our behavioral health business. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with debt-to-capital ratio of 39.2%, in line our with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for $480 million. Year-to-date, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock for 1.7 billion, pacing ahead of our full year outlook of approximately $2 billion. We will remain opportunistic with share repurchases, especially considering the share price and recent volatility in the market. As noted in our earnings release, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to maintain an appropriately prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 48.6 days at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 2.1 days sequentially and an increase of 0.9 days year-over-year. As a reminder, we continue to expect days in claims payable to be in the low 40s range over time and anticipate normalization towards this range in the coming quarters as cycle times shortened and COVID-related claims uncertainty recedes. Operating cash flow was approximately $2.6 billion or two times net income in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the business optimization charge I discussed earlier, operating cash flow would have been 1.4 times net income. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are planning to make planning to make incremental investments in the fourth incremental investments in the fourth quarter in Medicare Advantage marketing and retention and in capabilities and services that we expect will enhance customer satisfaction, supporting our growth in 2024 and beyond.  While we are disappointed in the outcome of the recently released Star quality ratings, we remain committed to this important line of business for the long-term and are exploring all options to mitigate the financial impact on 2025. Turning to 2024. Although we are not planning to provide specific guidance on this call, I would like to review some of the tailwinds and headwinds that are known at this time, starting with our tailwinds. We continue to optimize our health benefits business, including by executing a multiyear margin recovery in our commercial risk-based margins to return to pre-pandemic levels and expect margin improvement will continue next year. We also anticipate improvement in Medicare earnings, driven in part by corrective actions taken in our 2024 Medicare Advantage bids to improve financial performance in Puerto Rico, where we experienced significant challenges this year. We expect continued momentum in Carelon, including growth in Carelon services, driven by new product launches and opportunities for meaningful external growth across businesses and the ramp-up of BioPlus and the launch of Carelon Advanced Home delivery both of which to supplement ongoing momentum within Carelon Rx. We also expect to enhance operating efficiency as a result of the actions we took during the third quarter and we'll continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiency as we transform our cost structure over the long term. And we expect today's higher interest rate environment to drive growth in investment income. Our tailwinds will be partially offset by our headwinds, which all relate to the Medicaid business, where we anticipate membership attrition associated with ongoing eligibility redeterminations and the net loss of approximately 930,000 additional members associated with changes in our footprint. While Medicaid rates remain actuarially sound, we're also mindful of the risks associated with evolving risk pools. And we'll continue to monitor and manage these dynamics closely. Beyond 2024, Medicaid offers attractive long-term growth opportunities, notably in specialized populations, and we anticipate a return to growth in 2025 and beyond. Most importantly, the balance and resilience of our diverse businesses provides confidence in our near-term outlook while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon Divisions, position us to deliver on our long-term growth commitments. At this point in time, we believe the current consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share of approximately $37 in 2024 is appropriate. And we anticipate delivering another year of growth consistent with our long-term compound annual growth rate target next year. We look forward to providing more specific guidance, on our fourth quarter earnings call. Finally, as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. It has been a pleasure to serve this organization for more than 29 years, including the past seven in my current role. I have been involved in 88 quarterly earnings calls since Anthem went public in 2001, including 30 of them as Chief Financial Officer. Every year has had its opportunities and challenges and 2024 is no different. We serve our members while furthering our mission and will continue to meet and exceed our shareholder commitments. The balance and resilience of our businesses has created numerous tailwinds and has allowed us to overcome various headwinds, and I'm confident we will continue to do so. I feel fortunate to have been part of what I believe to be the best leadership team in the industry and to be leading the finance organization in an even stronger position than when I took over. I've enjoyed engaging with all of you over the years. I want to thank you for your support. I look forward to supporting Mark Kaye, as he assumes the role of CFO, ensuring a smooth transition before retiring, to spend more time with my family in the first quarter of next year. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Thanks and John, I wish you the best and the retirement. It's been great working with you, and I really appreciate all the help over the years. I want to maybe just ask on the commercial at margin improvement story and what you've been doing there, is if you ex-out that the year this quarter, what was the underlying cost trend for you? Did you see any pockets of variance and utilization that are worth calling out? And you guys have said on the recorded or the message so far, several times that you have that there will be some additional benefits on the commercial margin improvement story into next year. Is there any way to size that that or talk about relative to how much gain you had this year from that repricing and the other things you're doing to improve the margin on the commercial side?\nJohn Gallina: Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the kind words at the beginning. In terms of answering your question specifically though, we're certainly obviously very pleased with the performance of our health benefits businesses in the third quarter as well as year-to-date. As you know, we've increased margins quite significantly. And the health benefit segment margins, we guided to improve those 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year, and we're very much on track to deliver that. From a line of business, in particular, we're not providing specific margin information and specific detail on commercial versus Medicaid versus Medicare since we are operating this as a holistic health benefit segment. But we do expect continued improvement in the commercial margins into '24 as we continue to work on our strategy of ensuring that the pricing truly reflects the underlying cost structure, as well as additional penetrations in the fee-based businesses what we used to call the 5 to 131 strategy. So, we feel very good about where we're heading and our trajectory into 2024. So thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, A.J., and I'll just reiterate John's comments on commercial. I think the team has done a really nice job as we shared, this is a multiyear journey in terms of the commercial business, and we feel like we're right on track. And as -- the team has done a really nice job of balancing both membership retention, as well as getting our margins in line where we believe they need to be. So thanks for the question. And next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning, and thanks for the question. And let me just echo my congratulations, John, on your retirement. I wanted to ask on the Medicare business. Could you talk about the goal for improving Star scores? Are you investing to kind of get back to the level that you are out with 65% of members in 4-star plans? And over what period are you thinking? And how should we think about the magnitude of the incremental investments planned for the fourth quarter as well as into next year. And any comment on the kind of how long it would take to reach the run rate of optimization savings, the $750 million that you talked about would be helpful as well. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Nathan. Let me -- I anticipate a number of questions around star. So perhaps I'll just address that topic holistically. Improving stars for us is an enterprise priority. So I want to start with that. And we have a long-term commitment to the MA business and are committed to offering high-quality plans for seniors. But as I said in my opening comments, we're extremely disappointed on the recent results of the Stars and the decline that we saw in the number of our members in 4-star plans for payment year '25. Just a little background, I think, might help. We experienced some declines in the CAP survey scores, which were the most heavily weighted measures. And we were also impacted by that new CMS statistical methodology, which caused some significant increases in cut points. As you think about our performance, we improved in about half of the star measures, but those were not enough to offset the impact of the heavily weighted measures and higher cut points, therefore, having three of our largest contracts suffered in our star ratings, which you've noted. As I shared, we have already started making those investments and earlier this year, we were specifically addressing areas around the heightened focus for CAHPS that drove the decline. One of the very specific examples is scaling the My Health Advocate model, which again I shared a little bit about that in my opening remarks. The model is unique and highly personalized customer service and it's tailored specifically to help members with problems central to CAHPS improvement. It's a model that we've had in place in our commercial business and has been incredibly successful. Other areas that we saw in the data were about enhancing our core and supplemental benefits to reduce members out-of-pocket costs, which showed up in our start results, and also simplifying how those members use our over-the-counter benefits. We've gone on a journey around value-based care, as we've shared with you and we're going to continue to accelerate that and embed some of those results as well into our contracting process. And we also made tech steps last year to improve the processes around clinical decision appeals, which was also an area around the higher cut points. In terms of financial impact, we expect a reduction in 2025 quality bonus revenue of approximately $500 million after offsets from our contracting provisions. As John and I both shared, we've already aggressively begun to mitigate that headwind for 2025, and we do have a number of levels at our disposal, including contract diversification, operating expense efficiencies, capital deployment and looking at targeted network and product enhancements. Overall, we're going to continue to work on that. Our timelines have already begun on this I feel we have a very, very good line of sight to the opportunities that we have. And again, because of the diversified business model that we've talked to you about, we feel that the earnings power of our combined businesses between health benefits and Carelon allow us to continue to feel comfortable about our adjusted earnings for share growth annually of 12% to 15% over the long-term. So thanks again for the question. Appreciate the opportunity to holistically address what we're doing about STARS. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, hi, good morning. This is [Kyle] on for Lisa. Just want to add my thanks to John. I'm wishing all the best. Switching to Medicaid, appreciate all the color on the redeterminations and the front-loaded disenrollment trends. Can you talk about how membership is trending relative to what you expected earlier this year and how acuity mix is trending? And then related on the commercial side, how membership growth is tracking it in the employer group and individual businesses? Are you guys getting the growth you anticipated? And is there anything to call out on the margin side? Is there anything about this year and the 2024? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you for the question, Kyle, and certainly appreciate all the commentary. First of all, on Medicaid, the Medicaid disenrollment, as we said, has been very much front-loaded. And in terms of how that compares to our expectations, our expectations were as it would have been more normalized over a 12 to 14 month process. What we are seeing is that there's administrative churn and that a lot of people are losing Medicaid coverage temporarily and then they're coming back on. We're reenrolling folks 30, 60, 90 days after they were disenrolled and that was, that dynamic was not part of the original thought process but it's certainly part of the reality. I'd like to say September 30th or December 31st for that matter is just going to be one point in time over a 12 month to 14 month process. What we have not seen, and maybe the most important element is that at the beginning of the year, when we discussed that we think that we're going to going to retain about 40% to 45% of all Medicaid members who received coverage during the PHE, we still believe that is a very good estimate. And by the time the dust settles in the third quarter of 2024, we feel good about that estimate. It's just going to be a little bumpier or rockier along the way because of the gaps in coverage and because of the administrative churn. And on the commercial side, we're actually seeing really excellent growth in the individual ACA. Once redeterminations began in a particular state, the level of applications on the ACA products were up three times the amount that they were prior to that. And so that really does point to the fact that we do have the catcher's mitt in action. The employer-sponsored side that's actually going maybe a little bit less than we had anticipated. So individual ACA is going a little bit faster, employers sponsored a little bit slower. But all in, we really do believe that by the time we get through this entire process, which won't be completed until sometime in the third quarter of 2024, that the estimates we provided at beginning of the year will prove to be pretty good estimates. So hopefully, that helps. Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. Wanted to follow-up on the Medicaid redeterminations question there. So I appreciate all that commentary you just made. Would it be fair to say that at this point in part driven by the fact that you've got seemingly good and actuarially sound rate updates from your states that you haven't really seen all that much normalization of your margins in 2023. I believe you came into the year thinking that you performed in 2022 above your long-term targeted range, and there might be some pressure. I would love to just get an update on how that's performed in 2023 and how you're thinking or potentially considering that in your comments on 2024? Thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Yes, sure. Thank you very much for that question. And actually, I think Kyle did ask about Acuity as well. So hopefully, I'll address both of those here with this answer. Medicaid continues to be doing very well very much in line with our expectations and in line with what we saw coming. The one thing that I will reinforce is that in the rating formulas in the future or currently now is an acuity factor that's supposed to take changes in acuity into consideration. That factor was not in place in 2019. So comparisons to 2019 really aren't all that relevant at this point in time for that purpose. What we've seen thus far though is very little change in the overall acuity of the book. We are taking a very close look at that. And as I stated in my prepared comments, we're going to be monitoring that extremely closely and working with our states. So I'm very happy to report that all of the renewals that we've had with the discussions we've had with the states thus far, we have been provided actuarially sound rates. And we believe with actuarially sound rates, we can continue to deliver on Medicaid consistent with how we have in the past, providing a lot of benefits to beneficiaries and providing returns to the shareholders. So, thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, John. And I think as -- just to put a, sort of, summary on that, we feel we've got great visibility into the rest of this year. And the discussions around 2024 have been incredibly productive with about 50% of our premiums with good visibility there. So we think that those conversations are going well, and things are tracking according to expectations. So thanks for the question and next question please.\nOperator: Next we'll go to line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Thank you very much. I just also want to reiterate congratulations to John and thank you for all the help. Just wanted to circle up with a quick follow-up on MA. Appreciate all the questions on my health advocate and efforts there. I just wanted to know if there's any early thoughts on how much of the headwind you can mitigate with contract diversification/ And then kind what the time line is for getting all those approvals at the state level to carry that forward. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. As we think about that, as I said, we've got a number of levers at our disposal. And so I would focus on that. But in terms of contract diversification, about a third of the members affected were in group contracts. So we'll look at moving those potentially to a 4-Star contract. But again, I just want to reiterate, it's just one lever in our toolbox, and so we're not just looking at that, but we're looking across all of the things to have a mitigation for 2025. So thanks again for the question. And again, a lot happening in our enterprise around the efforts there to make sure that we remediate and stay very focused. This is an enterprise priority for us. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. And I was add to my congratulations to John as well. I guess far as the cost cutting -- this cost cutting was quite large. And I guess I just want to get a little more color because exactly kind of what was driving this? It sounds like this was all before your new stars was going to be off for 2025, because it sounds like it was more a 2024 issue. I think in the comments, you said something on the line so that's going to help you deliver lower cost to customers but also addresses some of the uncertainty in 2024. So, I just want a little more color on that, how much of this is going to improve benefits in MA versus, I think you made technology investments. Just a little more rationale for the move why it's so big? And then, if you're doing it this move now, how do you think about your ability to find significant savings to offset Stars in 2025? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I think let me put this in a little perspective because it's important to note, we're always evaluating our cost structure. And as we headed into 2024, we took very proactive and decisive action in the third quarter. We wanted a couple of things; one, increase our financial and operational flexibility and also ensure that we're positioned to deliver on our commitments to stakeholders. So, if you look at the charge in total, I mean, it really is kind of focused in three areas of cost management. And I think it's prudent to continue to always look at your cost structure, something we've been doing is, obviously, as we've been looking to manage that. And let me go through the three pieces because I think it's important. First, as you know, and we've talked about quite a bit on these calls, we've been investing over the past several years in modernizing our infrastructure, particularly around digital capabilities and migrating a lot of our applications to the cloud, consolidating our systems and our data and now most recently, use cases on using AI to drive greater efficiencies. The pace of technological innovation has changed and it continues to accelerate. And again, as I said, we're committed to deploying those responsibly quickly in our company. So what you're seeing in that first bucket is the write-down of some of those legacy processes that have now been replaced with our support -- that support our long-term goals with digital and AI and other things. And we've gone through that first phase that we've been talking about over the last several years on consolidation, data aggregation, et cetera. The second adjustments were really to our workforce. And that, again -- last year, we aligned our structure on benefits and services. This gave us an opportunity to look at redundancies across our business and our processes and eliminate handoffs, streamlined, very focused on ensuring that members because of our large benefit businesses can move between those businesses. It's an integral part of our strategy. And so that's been an important part of streamlining our work processes, simplifying our member experiences. And so as you think about the investments that we've been making in technology, particularly our front-door applications and things that automate some of our work, this was an opportunity for us to make sure that we had the right scaling of our workforce. And again, in the bigger scheme, these are not significant numbers. But again, I think it's really important that we constantly look at our cost structure. Then the last part is we went to a hybrid work environment. We've been evaluating the size and locations of our work sites, and we took the opportunity to further optimize those to make sure that we were located in the right places and had the right footprint. So as you think about all those, it's an approximately $700 million of charges, and it results in a run rate of about $750 million. Again, as John said, it doesn't all drop to the bottom line but that we think is important to support our long-term growth in our enterprise strategy. So that gives you a bit of a sense of how we thought about these as an ongoing opportunity to continue to optimize our cost, which we think is important for affordability in healthcare. So thanks very much for the question, and next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you and echo my congratulations to John. I was hoping that you guys could give a little bit more context around the recapture rate of the terminated Medicaid lives. So are you seeing recapture within Medicaid from the appeal process yet? And then on the ACA side, how do you think about the 30% recapture maturing into 2024 with your members, but then also potentially there's more people looking for ACA plans in 2024.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the question, Sarah. So in terms of the Medicaid redeterminations, as I stated, we're three to four months into the process. And it's a little early to have definitive in a very specific data points, but we do have certainly the bias. We've seen at 10% to 20% of the members who lost coverage in Medicaid in June reenrolled with us in the third quarter. So we certainly expect trends like that to continue. That's just one data point. And certainly, there's more time, but there are gaps in coverage. And then on the individual ACA, we are seeing by the time that folks leave Medicaid, there's typically a couple of month gap before they become enrolled an ACA plan. So, some of the membership this enrollment is temporary and there's gaps in coverage. So we've seen that throughout but we think we have a great opportunity in our 14 Blue states. You look at the number of members that were added to Medicaid in our 14 Blue states, that was about 8 million people across all 14 states, about 1.5 million of those were enrolled in Elevance Health Medicaid plans, which means that those other 6.5 million that went to a different carrier if that different carrier is able to retain 40% to 45% of those Medicaid similar to us, which I think is a reasonable expectation, that means that over half of the $6.5 million are in play. And we have leading market share in virtually every market we operate in, both in employer-sponsored as well as very strong in the ACA products. And so we do believe that you will see an acceleration of individual ACA membership in the early 2024 and mid-2024 for Elevance Health so hopefully, that answers your questions. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, John. And Sarah, I think just to sort of put a bow on this, I think it's really important just to frame it, almost 75% are administrative disenrollments and then over almost 37% are children under 18. So those are two areas, obviously, we're intensely focused on and there's a timing issue associated with this. So there's some delays in coverage and some coverage gaps, and we've been working really closely with our states. But as John said, we are seeing some encouraging signs where that 30% or more of our Medicaid members who are terminated prior to the end of June are now returning and retaining coverage with Elevance. So we expect that reenrollment to accelerate in the coming quarters. So I think that's important to keep in mind as we're all working through this process And certainly, the states are working through this process, and we have been continuing to adapt how we get to these members particularly the ones that were just enrolled for administrative reasons. So again, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers that we shared and the guidelines we showed, and we are seeing pickup certainly in the individual business as this progresses. So thanks again for the question. And next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Ha from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nMichael Ha: Thanks and congrats to John as well. I wanted to ask a quick question first regarding BioPlus. I wanted to confirm, did you mention you're going start migrating specialty script away from your legacy platform early next year. Would that imply you've made the decision to in-source your specialty drug spend away from CBS? And then my real question, just regarding MA and STAR ratings, in terms of the improvement efforts for CAP specifically, how much of the overall underperformance would you attribute to the providers pivot? And how can you fix those results for that without actually having ownership of providers? I mean how can you effectively drive your provider network to make the necessary changes to improve your results? Curious what the plan is there.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Michael. I'll have Pete start, and then I'll address your question on MA.\nPeter Haytaian: Thanks for the question, Michael. Yes, to answer your question directly, we are beginning the migration to BioPlus starting January 1. And again, just to reiterate, we've been very, very focused on the last year with regard to implementation and integration of BioPlus as it relates to our specialty strategy. A lot of the focus this year has been building the infrastructure and the team. So that we have the appropriate scale and capacity to take on the Elevance Health volume. And we feel very good about that.  As Gail noted in his prepared remarks, we are accelerating the time line in that regard, and we are moving forward with that for January 1. And again, this is all a part of our strategy in pharmacy, just to reiterate, and that is to in-source the strategic levers that matter. Specialty pharmacy is very critical to that as well as what we're doing in advanced home delivery. So again, excited about that. And yes, it is launching January 1.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. And to the second part of your question is we have delved in and really looked deeply at sort of what the drivers especially around the three contracts and sort of what the cut points were. I guess I would say there's a couple of things. One, has been easier navigation for our members. So I would not say it's because of ownership or lack of ownership, but I will address sort of value-based care. Remember, this was measurement around year 2022. We've made significant progress around moving a lot of our contracts to value-based care and embedding that into the way we do it. We've also worked closely with aggregators and have been building quite frankly, the numbers in that. So we do feel that our strategies are intensely focused, and our health navigator will significantly help them. The other area, quite frankly, around the cut points that impacted us was appeals and grievances, in some of our processes back in 2022. Those were very high performing contracts in the past and the cut points, while still good performance for us, were below the cut points. So I think those are very specific things that we can address. I want to take a moment, though, I think, to talk about where we are in value-based care because I think it is important to Medicare Advantage it's an area that we've been intensely focused on. As I mentioned on the primary care side, we've been working with a number of aggregators, plus increasing the amount of value-based care, but more importantly, embedding in those contracts quality and outcome measures as well as access and service. And I think those will have it, continue to, I guess, have an important impact on those. The other opportunity that we have is around specialty care. And we have been doing quite a bit of work on aggregation of specialty care, and particularly carving in high complex areas on specialty medical spend. That's an area where we see significant opportunities and don't see that as a really mature part of the market today. For example, Carelon is launching in January an oncology specialized care model with our affiliated health plans and it's allowing us also to more broadly commercialize that opportunity. We also see opportunities in musculoskeletal, renal and more. And I think this is a really differentiated focus because as we think about where members are very focused on access to surround specialty care, and I think we have a unique opportunity from both our innovation, our technology and the clinical expertise we offer to run that through Carelon with our health benefits, particularly in Medicare, but also across all of our lines of business. And that's going to be an important strength for us, and that's an area that I think in the specialty enablement will help our Medicare Advantage stars, but also help our patients get better access to that care. So that's -- we think it's a differentiator. But overall your question, I think we're very focused on the areas that drove some of the areas within those three contracts, and we feel we have very good line of sight to what they were and a lot of them were easier navigation for our members and making sure that it was a much more personalized experience than we've had in the past. And then again, ensuring that our supplemental benefits and over the counter are simpler and easier to use and we shared a little bit of that and we made those changes actually in our bids over the last couple of years. So thanks very much for the question, Michael, next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. I'll add my congrats for 88 quarters for John as well. My question, can you speak to the strategy of how Carelon and benefits segments aim to really work together over time? I'm specifically interested in how you tie sort of the various companies within Carelon together and then also on that care delivery side as part of the answer. And then lastly, are there certain any capabilities, certain capabilities that you think are missing or would be helpful for Elevance in terms of putting together that totality of strategy?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for that question, Josh. We'd love to share more about our strategy. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian talk about it as you know he leads that part of our business.\nPeter Haytaian: Yes. No, thanks for the question. I really appreciate it. I think it is a good opportunity to talk about our strategy holistically. As Gail mentioned in her prepared remarks, we talk about whole health and integrated care and driving affordability. But I really want to tag off of what Gail just talked about because I really do believe it's what we're focused on and differentiating ourselves on. And that is looking at high cost, high spend areas of healthcare. We face off with our health plan partners. We identify those areas. Specialty care is a tremendous opportunity and a real differentiator. Gail mentioned some areas that are critically important to us as we move forward and this is across all lines of business. Not one particular line of business, but when you think about high spend areas like oncology, like MSK, like renal, we have a wonderful opportunity to manage the member holistically and take full risk on those members. Now importantly that's - it's a big part of our strategy in terms of assuming full risk on those categories, driving earnings through Carelon, our unregulated entity and also focusing on areas and profit pools that are growing where we have a wonderful commercialization opportunity. And how this all plays together is we face off with Elevance Health. We identify these areas. We drive capitated full risk in many of these instances, and then we deploy those capabilities externally. This is really playing through in a nice way, and we're seeing that play through in terms of our growth trajectory. To just, again, reiterate what Gail said in January of this year, we're going to be launching an oncology program at full risk. We are also looking at taking full risk on the seriously mentally ill in behavioral health, where we're not only managing the behavioral health, but the physical health side. And this is all the type of thing that is playing through into our external pipeline, which we're seeing grow nicely. So I really appreciate the question, Josh. I think -- oh yes, and by the way, you did ask questions around additional capabilities. I would say that M&A also is an important part of our strategy as we move forward. And when you think about these highly specialized areas of care, we're not naive to think that we have the capabilities internally to handle all of it. When you think about MSK, when you think about renal, even what we're doing around the seriously mentally ill, we will be looking to not only partnerships, but acquisitions that can help us in that regard.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Pete, and thanks for the question. And I think if just summarize everything Pete said, we're really working in Carelon across kind of four major areas. Obviously, pharmacy with CarelonRx and then three pillars inside of our Carelon services business, care delivery, our insights and our behavioral health and all of those come together in all of Pete said. And we have a great opportunity to provide greater certainty and cost management to our owned health businesses, but externally commercialize that and seen a lot of momentum going into '24 on that, prove it on ourselves and then show the market the capabilities, particularly around the Blue system. So, thanks again for the question, Josh, and this will be our last question.\nOperator: And our final question, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks for squeezing me in, and I'll ask it my thanks to John for everything over the years. Really appreciate it, bud. Along those lines, Gail, maybe you can give us a little color around the CFO search and what you expect Mark to bring to the organization. And then just curious, if you have any early views on 2024 Medicare Advantage membership growth, both for Elevance and the market overall? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the question, Justin. And first of all, I will also offer my appreciation to John for his guidance and his counsel and honestly, our partnership over the time that I have been CEO. John and Mark has been here now for about a month. We're excited about having Mark Kaye join us. As you know, he was the CFO of Moody's. Mark brings -- he's an actuary by training, brings an incredible insight to our business. He and John have been working hand-in-hand on the transition, and John will be continuing as an adviser to me through the first quarter, as you heard in his opening remarks. I think we're at an incredible time in our business. We have great growth. We have a very diversified business and I'm excited about Mark joining our team and excited about the whole team. And thank John, we will all miss him, but he deserves time with his family and an opportunity to do things and work on his golf game, as you know, Justin. So, from that -- and I'm going to ask Felicia to comment a little bit about Medicare Advantage as you know, AEP has just started. So, it's really very early in days, so maybe Felicia can share a few comments about her thoughts on what we expect.\nFelicia Norwood: So good morning, Justin, and thank you. We are actually very excited about AEP. As Gail referenced, we are only three days in, but we're actually very pleased with the response we have from our brokers regarding the competitive positioning of our benefits and we believe that will be able to grow membership above the market in excess of some strategic decisions that we made around targeted market exit. So I want to point out that we made the very intentional and discrete decision to leave some markets that have been underperforming for us some period of time. Strategically, it was the right thing to do so that we can make sure we are focused on those markets where we have an opportunity to be very successful, deliver strong benefits for the members that we're privileged to serve. So as we think about where are today, we feel good about our positioning. As I said, we're very early in terms of where we are. But we believe as we head into 2024, we're going to be able deliver solid growth. As I said, I believe that will be above the overall market rate, based on where we're positioned. So thank you very much for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thank you, Felicia. And thank you to all of you on the line for your continued support and for joining us. Through a steadfast focus on whole health our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we will continue to meet the needs of clients, consumers and the communities we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner, while delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health. And have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 AM today through November 17, 2023, you may access the replay system at any time by dialing 866-405-7293, and international participants can dial 203-369-0605.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered another solid quarter of financial and operational performance, reflecting the strength and resilience of our diversified portfolio of businesses. Third quarter GAAP earnings per share was $5.45, including a charge we took during the quarter that I will discuss in detail in a moment. Adjusted earnings per share was $8.99 and reflecting growth of approximately 20% over the third quarter of 2022. Our results demonstrate our ability to execute on our enterprise strategy of delivering whole health solutions that are affordable, personalized and simple. Based on our strong year-to-date results and confidence in our outlook, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $33 for 2023, which includes incremental investments planned for the fourth quarter that will accelerate our strategy and enhance the performance of our Medicare Advantage business. It is the strength and resilience of our diverse businesses that provides comfort in our outlook, while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon division provides us the confidence to reiterate our commitment to our long-term target compound annual growth rate in adjusted earnings per share of 12% to 15%. Let me now turn to some highlights from our business segments. Starting with our Health Benefits division, which delivered robust third quarter results as we continue optimizing our diverse set of businesses, while responding to a dynamic and evolving business environment. In our Commercial Risk business, we are successfully executing on our goal to deliver operating margins in line with pre-pandemic norms. Retention has been consistent with our expectations, and we're pleased with our progress, which we expect will extend well into 2024. In the employer market, we're delivering differentiated value where it matters for employers, affordability, experience and simplicity. Over the past three years, we've become the sole source medical benefits provider for 32 of our national clients, including nine additional customers who will be consolidating their coverage with us effective January 2024. For large employers, we continue to deliver differentiated value and are seeing employers move away from point solutions and slice offerings to selecting Elevance Health as their strategic partner for the integration of all of their medical benefits. Consistent with these results, our advocacy solutions business, which provides personalized guidance and support to help members both navigate the complex healthcare system and optimize their health and well-being will add 37 new clients in 2024 covering more than 550,000 members. This includes two large employers who are returning to Elevance Health after previously testing third party advocacy vendors. In the individual market, we are seeing strong growth in plans that offer affordable and comprehensive coverage designed around the needs of consumers in our communities, including those transitioning from Medicaid to individual ACA coverage. Year-to-date, our individual membership has grown by 27%. Through the first half of this year, the latest period for which industry data is available, our individual ACA membership growth rate more than tripled that of our competitors in our 14 Blue states. Our government business also posted a strong quarter. In our Medicaid business, rates are actuarially appropriate, but we are absorbing a membership headwind related to the pace of Medicaid redeterminations, especially in states that have adopted accelerated time lines. Nearly three-quarters of all Medicaid beneficiaries terminated in our markets to-date have less coverage for administrative reasons and 37% of the attrition from our own health plans has been driven by individuals under 18 years of age, many of whom may still be eligible for Medicaid benefits. We are doing all we can to ensure continuity of coverage for as many consumers as possible, working closely with our state partners to ensure individuals eligible for Medicaid retain coverage while also offering affordable ACA exchange plans in nearly all of our Blue counties. We are seeing encouraging signs in some of our Blue states where we offer Medicaid and commercial coverage. We have seen 30% or more of our Medicaid members who were terminated prior to the end of June, return or retain coverage with Elevance Health, albeit with gaps in coverage that can extend for several months. We expect re-enrollment to accelerate in the coming quarters as we continue with our omni-channel approach to outreach and engagement, ensuring our members are aware of their options. Accordingly, we anticipate the rate of membership attrition associated with redeterminations will slow considerably in the coming quarters. In Medicare, we continue to offer high-quality plans that provide seniors access to comprehensive and coordinated care, and we are committed to doing so for the long-term. We're disappointed, however, with our Stars performance for measurement year 2022, which is the basis for Star ratings that will impact the 2025 payment year and specifically, with our decline in consumer survey scores and the way in which CMS applied a new statistical methodology that resulted in significant increases to many star measure touchpoints. To improve our performance in future periods, we have already commenced investments in four primary areas: service, product, network access and operations. For example, in July of this year, we built on the success of our innovative advocacy model in the employer market by adapting it for the unique needs of Medicare eligible consumers. This new program, My Health Advocate is a comprehensive, personalized and relationship-based customer service model that enables our members to effectively navigate the health care system, their benefits, and ultimately, to improve their overall health and well-being. Furthermore, we have enhanced our core and supplemental benefits to reduce member's out-of-pocket costs for prescription medications, simplified our dental benefits and strengthened our grocery and over-the-counter benefits. We're also simplifying consumer and provider experiences through the automation and elimination of certain prior authorizations, accelerating our work with value-based care provider partners and improving clinical decision appeal rates. Collectively, these actions and the ongoing investments should enhance our performance in key star measures and ultimately increase member satisfaction with our plans. We are actively pursuing all our options and exploring actions to mitigate the direct financial impact on payment year 2025, including through contract diversification, operating efficiency, and capital deployment alternatives. We will provide updates on our action plans and progress in future engagements in advance of 2025. Moving to Carelon. We are pleased with our momentum in the business as it continues to advance its strategy of integrated physical, behavioral, social and pharmacy services to deliver whole health affordably. Carelon Services delivered particularly strong growth in operating earnings, led by the expansion of our post-acute care management solutions. We also extended our service offerings in adjacent areas, including durable medical equipment and wound care, further enhancing our customer value proposition and differentiation. CarelonRx continues to make significant progress towards the near-term rollout of multiple new capabilities that will enhance the affordability and experience of pharmacy for our members and CarelonRx customers. One of these capabilities is EnsureRx an integrated benefit for commercial pharmacy members. That compares the benefit cost for over 50 covered generic medications to our network of multiple cash discount cards then automatically applies the lowest cost at any pharmacy. The program launches early next year, and we will save our customers money while enhancing their experience EnsureRx will also capture claim data to ensure full safety checks and maintain the integrity of our data. We're also pleased with the integration of BioPlus, which continues to track ahead of schedule, and we expect to begin migrating specialty scripts from our legacy pharmacy platform early next year. Finally, we remain on track to launch our advanced home delivery capability in the fourth quarter. Together, these businesses will allow us to deliver even better consumer experiences and enhance affordability while creating additional shareholder value over time. Now I'd like to address the actions we took during the quarter to transform our cost structure and enhance our operating efficiency. With affordability of health care, a paramount concern for all of our customers and more uncertainty in the business environment heading into 2024, we took proactive and decisive action in the third quarter to increase our financial and operational flexibility and to ensure we will remain well-positioned to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Specifically, we completed a strategic review of our operations, assets and the investments we've made over the years to identify opportunities to increase efficiency and enhance focus, all while driving greater impact from our programs at scale. This resulted in workforce and asset optimization that will make us more nimble, focused and efficient and allow us to concentrate our resources on the most promising programs while further optimizing our physical footprint. The pace of technological innovation is rapid and accelerating, and we are committed to keeping pace. As we pivot away from some legacy projects including those tied to systems that are being replaced with cloud-based models, we are also scaling key digital programs for greater impact. One example is HealthOS, a key enabler of our strategy that is helping to change the way care providers deliver care, while reducing administrative burden. HealthOS is our digital platform for health that allows us to exchange data bi-directionally with providers in real time and essential to a number of our priorities, including our approach to value-based care. We are also in the early stages of rolling out new AI capabilities and large language models that are helping us personalize member experiences and automate administrative tasks. We're excited about the possibilities of the rapid technological innovation that is underway and are committed to continuous improvement, innovation and the ongoing optimization of our processes reengineering much of what we do while delivering more personalized experiences to our members along the way. Before I close \u2013 and are committed to continuous improvement, innovation and the ongoing optimization of our processes, reengineering much of what we do while delivering more personalized experiences to our members along the way. Before I close, I'd like to note that we remain confident in our ability to close the acquisition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana. We're actively working with local regulators and stakeholders to address any remaining questions. The deal offers tremendous value and opportunity for the people of Louisiana, including through the creation of a multibillion dollar foundation focused on improving their health and lives, and we look forward to the privilege of serving as their lifetime trusted health partner. As you will hear from John in just a moment, the balance of our diverse set of businesses, the momentum of our enterprise strategy and the decisive actions we have taken to enhance our operating efficiency, give us confidence in our ability to deliver strong growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2024. In closing, I want to thank all of our associates around the world for their dedication and hard work. In the third quarter, we were also pleased to be named one of America's greatest workplaces by Newsweek and the number one best large workplace in health care by Fortune. It is the work our associates do every day on behalf of the individuals we are privileged to serve that allows us to deliver strong operating results in service of our bold purpose to improve the health of humanity. Collectively, we are fueled by passion for having a positive impact on our communities, our members and the environment. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John to provide more on our operating results and outlook. John? Yes. Thanks for the question, A.J., and I'll just reiterate John's comments on commercial. I think the team has done a really nice job as we shared, this is a multiyear journey in terms of the commercial business, and we feel like we're right on track. And as -- the team has done a really nice job of balancing both membership retention, as well as getting our margins in line where we believe they need to be. So thanks for the question. And next question, please. Thanks for the question, Nathan. Let me -- I anticipate a number of questions around star. So perhaps I'll just address that topic holistically. Improving stars for us is an enterprise priority. So I want to start with that. And we have a long-term commitment to the MA business and are committed to offering high-quality plans for seniors. But as I said in my opening comments, we're extremely disappointed on the recent results of the Stars and the decline that we saw in the number of our members in 4-star plans for payment year '25. Just a little background, I think, might help. We experienced some declines in the CAP survey scores, which were the most heavily weighted measures. And we were also impacted by that new CMS statistical methodology, which caused some significant increases in cut points. As you think about our performance, we improved in about half of the star measures, but those were not enough to offset the impact of the heavily weighted measures and higher cut points, therefore, having three of our largest contracts suffered in our star ratings, which you've noted. As I shared, we have already started making those investments and earlier this year, we were specifically addressing areas around the heightened focus for CAHPS that drove the decline. One of the very specific examples is scaling the My Health Advocate model, which again I shared a little bit about that in my opening remarks. The model is unique and highly personalized customer service and it's tailored specifically to help members with problems central to CAHPS improvement. It's a model that we've had in place in our commercial business and has been incredibly successful. Other areas that we saw in the data were about enhancing our core and supplemental benefits to reduce members out-of-pocket costs, which showed up in our start results, and also simplifying how those members use our over-the-counter benefits. We've gone on a journey around value-based care, as we've shared with you and we're going to continue to accelerate that and embed some of those results as well into our contracting process. And we also made tech steps last year to improve the processes around clinical decision appeals, which was also an area around the higher cut points. In terms of financial impact, we expect a reduction in 2025 quality bonus revenue of approximately $500 million after offsets from our contracting provisions. As John and I both shared, we've already aggressively begun to mitigate that headwind for 2025, and we do have a number of levels at our disposal, including contract diversification, operating expense efficiencies, capital deployment and looking at targeted network and product enhancements. Overall, we're going to continue to work on that. Our timelines have already begun on this I feel we have a very, very good line of sight to the opportunities that we have. And again, because of the diversified business model that we've talked to you about, we feel that the earnings power of our combined businesses between health benefits and Carelon allow us to continue to feel comfortable about our adjusted earnings for share growth annually of 12% to 15% over the long-term. So thanks again for the question. Appreciate the opportunity to holistically address what we're doing about STARS. Next question, please. Thank you for the question, Kyle, and certainly appreciate all the commentary. First of all, on Medicaid, the Medicaid disenrollment, as we said, has been very much front-loaded. And in terms of how that compares to our expectations, our expectations were as it would have been more normalized over a 12 to 14 month process. What we are seeing is that there's administrative churn and that a lot of people are losing Medicaid coverage temporarily and then they're coming back on. We're reenrolling folks 30, 60, 90 days after they were disenrolled and that was, that dynamic was not part of the original thought process but it's certainly part of the reality. I'd like to say September 30th or December 31st for that matter is just going to be one point in time over a 12 month to 14 month process. What we have not seen, and maybe the most important element is that at the beginning of the year, when we discussed that we think that we're going to going to retain about 40% to 45% of all Medicaid members who received coverage during the PHE, we still believe that is a very good estimate. And by the time the dust settles in the third quarter of 2024, we feel good about that estimate. It's just going to be a little bumpier or rockier along the way because of the gaps in coverage and because of the administrative churn. And on the commercial side, we're actually seeing really excellent growth in the individual ACA. Once redeterminations began in a particular state, the level of applications on the ACA products were up three times the amount that they were prior to that. And so that really does point to the fact that we do have the catcher's mitt in action. The employer-sponsored side that's actually going maybe a little bit less than we had anticipated. So individual ACA is going a little bit faster, employers sponsored a little bit slower. But all in, we really do believe that by the time we get through this entire process, which won't be completed until sometime in the third quarter of 2024, that the estimates we provided at beginning of the year will prove to be pretty good estimates. So hopefully, that helps. Thank you. Next question, please. Yes. Thanks, John. And I think as -- just to put a, sort of, summary on that, we feel we've got great visibility into the rest of this year. And the discussions around 2024 have been incredibly productive with about 50% of our premiums with good visibility there. So we think that those conversations are going well, and things are tracking according to expectations. So thanks for the question and next question please. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. As we think about that, as I said, we've got a number of levers at our disposal. And so I would focus on that. But in terms of contract diversification, about a third of the members affected were in group contracts. So we'll look at moving those potentially to a 4-Star contract. But again, I just want to reiterate, it's just one lever in our toolbox, and so we're not just looking at that, but we're looking across all of the things to have a mitigation for 2025. So thanks again for the question. And again, a lot happening in our enterprise around the efforts there to make sure that we remediate and stay very focused. This is an enterprise priority for us. Next question please. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I think let me put this in a little perspective because it's important to note, we're always evaluating our cost structure. And as we headed into 2024, we took very proactive and decisive action in the third quarter. We wanted a couple of things; one, increase our financial and operational flexibility and also ensure that we're positioned to deliver on our commitments to stakeholders. So, if you look at the charge in total, I mean, it really is kind of focused in three areas of cost management. And I think it's prudent to continue to always look at your cost structure, something we've been doing is, obviously, as we've been looking to manage that. And let me go through the three pieces because I think it's important. First, as you know, and we've talked about quite a bit on these calls, we've been investing over the past several years in modernizing our infrastructure, particularly around digital capabilities and migrating a lot of our applications to the cloud, consolidating our systems and our data and now most recently, use cases on using AI to drive greater efficiencies. The pace of technological innovation has changed and it continues to accelerate. And again, as I said, we're committed to deploying those responsibly quickly in our company. So what you're seeing in that first bucket is the write-down of some of those legacy processes that have now been replaced with our support -- that support our long-term goals with digital and AI and other things. And we've gone through that first phase that we've been talking about over the last several years on consolidation, data aggregation, et cetera. The second adjustments were really to our workforce. And that, again -- last year, we aligned our structure on benefits and services. This gave us an opportunity to look at redundancies across our business and our processes and eliminate handoffs, streamlined, very focused on ensuring that members because of our large benefit businesses can move between those businesses. It's an integral part of our strategy. And so that's been an important part of streamlining our work processes, simplifying our member experiences. And so as you think about the investments that we've been making in technology, particularly our front-door applications and things that automate some of our work, this was an opportunity for us to make sure that we had the right scaling of our workforce. And again, in the bigger scheme, these are not significant numbers. But again, I think it's really important that we constantly look at our cost structure. Then the last part is we went to a hybrid work environment. We've been evaluating the size and locations of our work sites, and we took the opportunity to further optimize those to make sure that we were located in the right places and had the right footprint. So as you think about all those, it's an approximately $700 million of charges, and it results in a run rate of about $750 million. Again, as John said, it doesn't all drop to the bottom line but that we think is important to support our long-term growth in our enterprise strategy. So that gives you a bit of a sense of how we thought about these as an ongoing opportunity to continue to optimize our cost, which we think is important for affordability in healthcare. So thanks very much for the question, and next question. Yes. Thanks, John. And Sarah, I think just to sort of put a bow on this, I think it's really important just to frame it, almost 75% are administrative disenrollments and then over almost 37% are children under 18. So those are two areas, obviously, we're intensely focused on and there's a timing issue associated with this. So there's some delays in coverage and some coverage gaps, and we've been working really closely with our states. But as John said, we are seeing some encouraging signs where that 30% or more of our Medicaid members who are terminated prior to the end of June are now returning and retaining coverage with Elevance. So we expect that reenrollment to accelerate in the coming quarters. So I think that's important to keep in mind as we're all working through this process And certainly, the states are working through this process, and we have been continuing to adapt how we get to these members particularly the ones that were just enrolled for administrative reasons. So again, we feel pretty comfortable with the numbers that we shared and the guidelines we showed, and we are seeing pickup certainly in the individual business as this progresses. So thanks again for the question. And next question please. Thanks for the question, Michael. I'll have Pete start, and then I'll address your question on MA. Yes. And to the second part of your question is we have delved in and really looked deeply at sort of what the drivers especially around the three contracts and sort of what the cut points were. I guess I would say there's a couple of things. One, has been easier navigation for our members. So I would not say it's because of ownership or lack of ownership, but I will address sort of value-based care. Remember, this was measurement around year 2022. We've made significant progress around moving a lot of our contracts to value-based care and embedding that into the way we do it. We've also worked closely with aggregators and have been building quite frankly, the numbers in that. So we do feel that our strategies are intensely focused, and our health navigator will significantly help them. The other area, quite frankly, around the cut points that impacted us was appeals and grievances, in some of our processes back in 2022. Those were very high performing contracts in the past and the cut points, while still good performance for us, were below the cut points. So I think those are very specific things that we can address. I want to take a moment, though, I think, to talk about where we are in value-based care because I think it is important to Medicare Advantage it's an area that we've been intensely focused on. As I mentioned on the primary care side, we've been working with a number of aggregators, plus increasing the amount of value-based care, but more importantly, embedding in those contracts quality and outcome measures as well as access and service. And I think those will have it, continue to, I guess, have an important impact on those. The other opportunity that we have is around specialty care. And we have been doing quite a bit of work on aggregation of specialty care, and particularly carving in high complex areas on specialty medical spend. That's an area where we see significant opportunities and don't see that as a really mature part of the market today. For example, Carelon is launching in January an oncology specialized care model with our affiliated health plans and it's allowing us also to more broadly commercialize that opportunity. We also see opportunities in musculoskeletal, renal and more. And I think this is a really differentiated focus because as we think about where members are very focused on access to surround specialty care, and I think we have a unique opportunity from both our innovation, our technology and the clinical expertise we offer to run that through Carelon with our health benefits, particularly in Medicare, but also across all of our lines of business. And that's going to be an important strength for us, and that's an area that I think in the specialty enablement will help our Medicare Advantage stars, but also help our patients get better access to that care. So that's -- we think it's a differentiator. But overall your question, I think we're very focused on the areas that drove some of the areas within those three contracts, and we feel we have very good line of sight to what they were and a lot of them were easier navigation for our members and making sure that it was a much more personalized experience than we've had in the past. And then again, ensuring that our supplemental benefits and over the counter are simpler and easier to use and we shared a little bit of that and we made those changes actually in our bids over the last couple of years. So thanks very much for the question, Michael, next question, please. Yes. Thanks for that question, Josh. We'd love to share more about our strategy. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian talk about it as you know he leads that part of our business. Thanks, Pete, and thanks for the question. And I think if just summarize everything Pete said, we're really working in Carelon across kind of four major areas. Obviously, pharmacy with CarelonRx and then three pillars inside of our Carelon services business, care delivery, our insights and our behavioral health and all of those come together in all of Pete said. And we have a great opportunity to provide greater certainty and cost management to our owned health businesses, but externally commercialize that and seen a lot of momentum going into '24 on that, prove it on ourselves and then show the market the capabilities, particularly around the Blue system. So, thanks again for the question, Josh, and this will be our last question. Well, thanks for the question, Justin. And first of all, I will also offer my appreciation to John for his guidance and his counsel and honestly, our partnership over the time that I have been CEO. John and Mark has been here now for about a month. We're excited about having Mark Kaye join us. As you know, he was the CFO of Moody's. Mark brings -- he's an actuary by training, brings an incredible insight to our business. He and John have been working hand-in-hand on the transition, and John will be continuing as an adviser to me through the first quarter, as you heard in his opening remarks. I think we're at an incredible time in our business. We have great growth. We have a very diversified business and I'm excited about Mark joining our team and excited about the whole team. And thank John, we will all miss him, but he deserves time with his family and an opportunity to do things and work on his golf game, as you know, Justin. So, from that -- and I'm going to ask Felicia to comment a little bit about Medicare Advantage as you know, AEP has just started. So, it's really very early in days, so maybe Felicia can share a few comments about her thoughts on what we expect. Well, thank you, Felicia. And thank you to all of you on the line for your continued support and for joining us. Through a steadfast focus on whole health our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we will continue to meet the needs of clients, consumers and the communities we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner, while delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health. And have a great rest of the week."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "So good morning, Justin, and thank you. We are actually very excited about AEP. As Gail referenced, we are only three days in, but we're actually very pleased with the response we have from our brokers regarding the competitive positioning of our benefits and we believe that will be able to grow membership above the market in excess of some strategic decisions that we made around targeted market exit. So I want to point out that we made the very intentional and discrete decision to leave some markets that have been underperforming for us some period of time. Strategically, it was the right thing to do so that we can make sure we are focused on those markets where we have an opportunity to be very successful, deliver strong benefits for the members that we're privileged to serve. So as we think about where are today, we feel good about our positioning. As I said, we're very early in terms of where we are. But we believe as we head into 2024, we're going to be able deliver solid growth. As I said, I believe that will be above the overall market rate, based on where we're positioned. So thank you very much for the question."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong third quarter results. Given outperformance against our initial expectations year-to-date, we have increased our outlook for adjusted earnings per share in 2023 to be greater than $33, reflecting growth consistent with our long-term compound annual target of 12% to 15%. Our outlook includes incremental investments we have planned for the fourth quarter to support growth in Medicare Advantage in 2024 and beyond. Based on our updated guidance, our five-year compound annual growth rate in earnings per share is expected to be 16%, which makes Elevance Health the only company in our sector to have exceeded 15% over that time frame. We ended the third quarter with 47.3 million members, an increase of 42,000 members year-over-year driven by growth in BlueCard and ACA membership. During the quarter, medical membership declined by 664,000, driven by attrition in Medicaid due to eligibility redeterminations and a new entrant into one of our state programs in July, which resulted in a loss of approximately 140,000 Medicaid members. We are now three to four months into redeterminations of most of our states, and this enrollment in many appears to be front loaded with approximately three quarters of those terminated from Medicaid having lost coverage for administrative reasons. We are seeing many consumers return to Medicaid after being temporarily disenrolled, while others are experiencing gaps in coverage before transitioning on to ACA exchange plans. Given the patterns we have observed to-date, we expect reenrollment in the Medicaid and transitions to ACA exchange plans to accelerate. Operating revenue in the third quarter was $42.5 billion, an increase of 7.2% over the prior year quarter. Growth was driven by rate increases to cover overall trend in our health benefits business, coupled with double-digit top line growth in CarelonRx driven by growth in pharmacy customers and the acquisition of BioPlus. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the third quarter was 86.8% an improvement of 40 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year, driven by premium rate adjustments to cover medical cost trend and solid performance within our government business. Now I would like to spend a moment discussing the business optimization charge we announced as part of our results this morning. As Gail mentioned earlier, we took decisive action during the quarter to position our company for long-term success by enhancing operating efficiency, refining the focus of our investments and optimizing our physical footprint. These actions will ensure we stay well positioned to provide affordable products while delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. As a result of this strategic review, we incurred a business optimization charge of approximately $700 million, comprised of write-offs and write-downs of internally developed software and related assets, severance and leases associated with optimizing our physical footprint. These actions will result in gross annual run rate operating expense savings of approximately $750 million per year, a portion of which will be reinvested in growth opportunities, including Medicare Advantage and the accelerated rollout of certain digital capabilities. We are committed to doing even better and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance operating efficiency further. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio in the third quarter was 11.1%, and a decrease of 30 basis points over the prior year quarter. However, the third quarter last year included additional out-of-period quality improvement expenses due to the accounting realignment we announced then. Excluding out-of-period quality improvement expenses in the third quarter of last year, our adjusted operating expense ratio would have been unchanged. Adjusted operating gain for the enterprise grew 12.6%, led by our Health Benefits business, which delivered double-digit growth as we continue to optimize premium rates and products while enhancing operating efficiency across the segment. Operating margin for our Health Benefits improved by 30 basis points year-over-year consistent with our expectations. Carelon also delivered a strong quarter with growth in pharmacy growth in pharmacy customers and the acquisition of BioPlus propelling CarelonRx to 17.5% revenue growth. CarelonRx operating earnings included investments to support the build-out of our specialty pharmacy and advanced home delivery capabilities both of which will ramp up in the coming months. In addition, comparisons to the third quarter of 2022 have been negatively affected by the out-of-period fee-based revenue realized in the third quarter of last year. In Carelon Services, strong growth in operating earnings was driven by expansion of Carelon post-acute solutions and growth in our behavioral health business. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with debt-to-capital ratio of 39.2%, in line our with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock for $480 million. Year-to-date, we repurchased 3.8 million shares of common stock for 1.7 billion, pacing ahead of our full year outlook of approximately $2 billion. We will remain opportunistic with share repurchases, especially considering the share price and recent volatility in the market. As noted in our earnings release, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to maintain an appropriately prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 48.6 days at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 2.1 days sequentially and an increase of 0.9 days year-over-year. As a reminder, we continue to expect days in claims payable to be in the low 40s range over time and anticipate normalization towards this range in the coming quarters as cycle times shortened and COVID-related claims uncertainty recedes. Operating cash flow was approximately $2.6 billion or two times net income in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact of the business optimization charge I discussed earlier, operating cash flow would have been 1.4 times net income. Given strong performance year-to-date, we are planning to make planning to make incremental investments in the fourth incremental investments in the fourth quarter in Medicare Advantage marketing and retention and in capabilities and services that we expect will enhance customer satisfaction, supporting our growth in 2024 and beyond.  While we are disappointed in the outcome of the recently released Star quality ratings, we remain committed to this important line of business for the long-term and are exploring all options to mitigate the financial impact on 2025. Turning to 2024. Although we are not planning to provide specific guidance on this call, I would like to review some of the tailwinds and headwinds that are known at this time, starting with our tailwinds. We continue to optimize our health benefits business, including by executing a multiyear margin recovery in our commercial risk-based margins to return to pre-pandemic levels and expect margin improvement will continue next year. We also anticipate improvement in Medicare earnings, driven in part by corrective actions taken in our 2024 Medicare Advantage bids to improve financial performance in Puerto Rico, where we experienced significant challenges this year. We expect continued momentum in Carelon, including growth in Carelon services, driven by new product launches and opportunities for meaningful external growth across businesses and the ramp-up of BioPlus and the launch of Carelon Advanced Home delivery both of which to supplement ongoing momentum within Carelon Rx. We also expect to enhance operating efficiency as a result of the actions we took during the third quarter and we'll continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiency as we transform our cost structure over the long term. And we expect today's higher interest rate environment to drive growth in investment income. Our tailwinds will be partially offset by our headwinds, which all relate to the Medicaid business, where we anticipate membership attrition associated with ongoing eligibility redeterminations and the net loss of approximately 930,000 additional members associated with changes in our footprint. While Medicaid rates remain actuarially sound, we're also mindful of the risks associated with evolving risk pools. And we'll continue to monitor and manage these dynamics closely. Beyond 2024, Medicaid offers attractive long-term growth opportunities, notably in specialized populations, and we anticipate a return to growth in 2025 and beyond. Most importantly, the balance and resilience of our diverse businesses provides confidence in our near-term outlook while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon Divisions, position us to deliver on our long-term growth commitments. At this point in time, we believe the current consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share of approximately $37 in 2024 is appropriate. And we anticipate delivering another year of growth consistent with our long-term compound annual growth rate target next year. We look forward to providing more specific guidance, on our fourth quarter earnings call. Finally, as many of you know, this will be my last earnings call as CFO of Elevance Health. It has been a pleasure to serve this organization for more than 29 years, including the past seven in my current role. I have been involved in 88 quarterly earnings calls since Anthem went public in 2001, including 30 of them as Chief Financial Officer. Every year has had its opportunities and challenges and 2024 is no different. We serve our members while furthering our mission and will continue to meet and exceed our shareholder commitments. The balance and resilience of our businesses has created numerous tailwinds and has allowed us to overcome various headwinds, and I'm confident we will continue to do so. I feel fortunate to have been part of what I believe to be the best leadership team in the industry and to be leading the finance organization in an even stronger position than when I took over. I've enjoyed engaging with all of you over the years. I want to thank you for your support. I look forward to supporting Mark Kaye, as he assumes the role of CFO, ensuring a smooth transition before retiring, to spend more time with my family in the first quarter of next year. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. Good morning, A.J. and thank you for the kind words at the beginning. In terms of answering your question specifically though, we're certainly obviously very pleased with the performance of our health benefits businesses in the third quarter as well as year-to-date. As you know, we've increased margins quite significantly. And the health benefit segment margins, we guided to improve those 30 to 60 basis points year-over-year, and we're very much on track to deliver that. From a line of business, in particular, we're not providing specific margin information and specific detail on commercial versus Medicaid versus Medicare since we are operating this as a holistic health benefit segment. But we do expect continued improvement in the commercial margins into '24 as we continue to work on our strategy of ensuring that the pricing truly reflects the underlying cost structure, as well as additional penetrations in the fee-based businesses what we used to call the 5 to 131 strategy. So, we feel very good about where we're heading and our trajectory into 2024. So thank you for the question. Yes, sure. Thank you very much for that question. And actually, I think Kyle did ask about Acuity as well. So hopefully, I'll address both of those here with this answer. Medicaid continues to be doing very well very much in line with our expectations and in line with what we saw coming. The one thing that I will reinforce is that in the rating formulas in the future or currently now is an acuity factor that's supposed to take changes in acuity into consideration. That factor was not in place in 2019. So comparisons to 2019 really aren't all that relevant at this point in time for that purpose. What we've seen thus far though is very little change in the overall acuity of the book. We are taking a very close look at that. And as I stated in my prepared comments, we're going to be monitoring that extremely closely and working with our states. So I'm very happy to report that all of the renewals that we've had with the discussions we've had with the states thus far, we have been provided actuarially sound rates. And we believe with actuarially sound rates, we can continue to deliver on Medicaid consistent with how we have in the past, providing a lot of benefits to beneficiaries and providing returns to the shareholders. So, thank you. Thank you for the question, Sarah. So in terms of the Medicaid redeterminations, as I stated, we're three to four months into the process. And it's a little early to have definitive in a very specific data points, but we do have certainly the bias. We've seen at 10% to 20% of the members who lost coverage in Medicaid in June reenrolled with us in the third quarter. So we certainly expect trends like that to continue. That's just one data point. And certainly, there's more time, but there are gaps in coverage. And then on the individual ACA, we are seeing by the time that folks leave Medicaid, there's typically a couple of month gap before they become enrolled an ACA plan. So, some of the membership this enrollment is temporary and there's gaps in coverage. So we've seen that throughout but we think we have a great opportunity in our 14 Blue states. You look at the number of members that were added to Medicaid in our 14 Blue states, that was about 8 million people across all 14 states, about 1.5 million of those were enrolled in Elevance Health Medicaid plans, which means that those other 6.5 million that went to a different carrier if that different carrier is able to retain 40% to 45% of those Medicaid similar to us, which I think is a reasonable expectation, that means that over half of the $6.5 million are in play. And we have leading market share in virtually every market we operate in, both in employer-sponsored as well as very strong in the ACA products. And so we do believe that you will see an acceleration of individual ACA membership in the early 2024 and mid-2024 for Elevance Health so hopefully, that answers your questions. Thank you for the question."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's second quarter 2023 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations and with us this morning on the earnings call are, Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; John Gallina, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial and Specialty Health Benefits division; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits division. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. John will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered strong second quarter results, driven by solid execution and continued progress towards our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner, focused on the whole health needs of the consumers we are privileged to serve. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $7.79 and adjusted earnings per share was $9.04, reflecting double-digit growth year-over-year as a result of the strong performance in the first half of the year and momentum across Elevance Health. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to be greater than $32.85. The balance and resilience of our diverse businesses provides confidence in our near-term outlook, while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon businesses position us to deliver on our long-term growth commitments. With respect to the second quarter, our Health Benefits business delivered particularly strong results as we continued to optimize our products, pricing and operations. We are successfully executing against the planned margin recovery of our commercial risk and Medicare Advantage businesses back toward pre-pandemic levels, and we are pleased with the performance of our Medicaid business. With Medicaid eligibility redeterminations now underway, our teams are working tirelessly to promote continuity of coverage for consumers through an omni-channel approach, working closely with our state partners. Our Medicaid and commercial colleagues are collaborating to educate members and communities on the process through in-person and online events, ensuring members know how to renew their Medicaid coverage when eligible or enroll in other forms of coverage, including our own individual ACA plans. To date, we have contacted more than 1.5 million of our Medicaid members. Meanwhile, our web-based digital decision support tool is seeing healthy utilization. The tool assesses eligibility for a wide variety of federal and state programs beyond health insurance to support consumers\u2019 whole health journey, including the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program, state-based programs that assist with food and security, housing and childcare programs, and more, with links that can route consumers to websites where they can enroll in these programs. More than half of the people using our support tool who qualify for commercial or Medicare coverage are clicking through embedded links to shop for plans and more than 60% of consumers eligible for Medicaid are clicking through to their state site for recertification. This body of work is especially important since many of the people who have lost access to Medicaid so far are losing it for administrative reasons. We expect many of these consumer will re-enroll in Medicaid over time. Transitions of coverage are not typically immediate. But emerging data points suggest consumers losing Medicaid are starting to transition onto ACA exchange plans. It's still early in the process and our expectations for coverage transitions remain unchanged. Our deep local roots and diversified product portfolio positions us uniquely well to meet consumers' needs regardless of age or socioeconomic status. Carelon continued to advance its strategy of integrating physical, behavioral, social, and pharmacy services to deliver whole health affordably, with ongoing investments and capabilities focused on serving people across their entire healthcare journey, connecting them to the care, support, and resources they need. Carelon Services delivered solid organic growth led by the expansion of post-acute care management solutions with our Medicare health plans. While Carelon Behavioral Health extended its leadership position through multiple external business wins with new and existing customers, new business awards and successful execution in these fast growing high-cost areas of trend underscore the value Carelon provides to health plans and the expanding earnings power and attractive growth profile of the Carelon Services business. CarelonRx also continued to grow nicely while investing in key value drivers. Specifically, specialty pharmacy and advanced home delivery revenue grew nearly 20% year-over-year and we posted solid operating earnings while absorbing investments in support of our long-term strategy. The integration of the BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy is now tracking ahead of schedule and we expect to begin migrating scripts early next year. Additionally, we remain on track to launch advanced home delivery by the end of 2023. Together, these capabilities will create additional shareholder value while allowing us to deliver even better consumer experiences in specialty and maintenance pharmacy. Expanding and more deeply integrating value-based care across the care continuum is foundational to our enterprise strategy. We are making significant progress in many key areas, including maternal health, where we have continued to expand our obstetrics practice consultants and quality incentive programs to additional markets given outstanding early results. These programs have helped improve timeliness to and adequacy of prenatal care and increased postpartum visit compliance, contributing to a reduction in pre-term births of 12% and low-birth weight deliveries of 20% in participating Medicaid populations. These programs have driven cost savings per delivery and first-year mom and baby costs of 5% to 10% and we are now offering them in 24 Medicaid and 11 commercial markets across the country. We're also working with care provider partners to enable acute care in the home, a patient centered care alternative to traditional care in the hospital that improves cost, quality and patient experiences. For select patients, acute care at home is safe, improves patient satisfaction and provides high value care, resulting in approximately a 20% reduction in cost, a 25% decrease in readmissions and a 50% reduction in time spent in bed. We have partnerships with a number of major health systems in our markets with strong results and have significant interest from other health systems to expand this work. Connectivity with care provider partners is crucial to supporting our value-based care strategy and to enabling personalized hybrid and virtual care. We are continuing to expand bi-directional data exchanges between our systems and care providers EMRs. Across 24 markets, we are now connected with over 1,700 hospitals. In addition to enabling physicians practice value-based care more effectively, these arrangements have simplified common business practices, resulting in more than 60% fewer requests for clinical information and more than 80% less provider appeals. This has not only enhanced operating efficiency for our clinicians and care provider partners, it has also accelerated care approval processes for consumers. Automation remains an area of focus and opportunity across Elevance Health and deep data sets like ours are foundational for generative artificial intelligence. Our data is centralized and cleansed and we are in the process of scaling digital solutions for greater impact and testing the application of new technologies. We're harnessing our adaptive artificial intelligent solution to promote identification and access to whole health services during physical health procedures like surgery. Our approach allows us to cast a broad net to perform initial screenings for depression and other social drivers of health to ensure we are addressing our members\u2019 whole health needs. Our digital chronic concierge care program is a cloud-based care management platform that connects the patient's entire care management team to triage, monitor and engage with patients through convenient digital channels. Fully digital enrollment, engagement and support, alongside key behavioral health components, provides members with highly personalized proactive, concierge-like experiences, while reducing the overall cost of care for members with chronic conditions. We're also using large language models to assist our call center agents, improving their efficiency, accuracy and quality. We're excited about these opportunities and the positive impacts they will have on consumers, care provider partners and the operating efficiency of Elevance Health. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world. Accordingly, environmental, social and governance frameworks are embedded in our enterprise strategy. We continue to lead our sector with respect to ESG ratings from three of the most prominent corporate governance research, ratings and analytics firms. And we were pleased that USA Today recently ranked Elevance Health fifth out of 400 organizations in its inaugural America\u2019s Climate Leaders, based on core emissions reductions year-over-year and core greenhouse gas reductions. Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to thank our more than 100,000 associates for the works that they do every day on behalf of the members we are privileged to serve. Their dedication is what allows us to advance our strategy and deliver strong operating results in service of our bold purpose to improve the health of humanity. Collectively, our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong second quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $7.79 and adjusted earnings per share of $9.04. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the focused execution of our strategy. Our results exceeded our expectations and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses provides confidence in our outlook. As a result, we have increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be greater than $32.85 in 2023, reflecting strong growth consistent with our long-term targeted compound annual growth rate. We ended the second quarter with 48 million members, up 938,000 year-over-year. During the quarter, medical membership declined by 135,000 members as the majority of our Medicaid states initiated eligibility redeterminations. While we are still very early in the redetermination process, at this time, we are seeing many Medicaid members losing coverage for administrative reasons. Many of these consumers will likely re-enroll in Medicaid in the near to intermediate term. In fact, many Medicaid beneficiaries who lose coverage for administrative reasons have 30 to 90 days to re-enroll depending on the state with coverage retroactive to the termination date. Meanwhile, we are seeing encouraging early indications that Medicaid beneficiaries losing coverage are transitioning into ACA exchange plans. But transitions of coverage are not always immediate. And our expectation is that commercial membership growth will re-accelerate in the back half of this year and into 2024. Overall, we believe our prior outlook for coverage transitions remains appropriate. We continue to expect by the end of the initial redetermination cycle that 40% to 45% of net new beneficiaries on Medicaid as a result of the suspension of redeterminations during the public health emergency will stay on Medicaid. But most importantly, we are well positioned to provide people who lose Medicaid coverage with alternative plan offerings. We believe it is essential that these individuals have access to quality healthcare coverage and we are positioned to meet their needs. With respect to our membership outlook, please note that a new entrant into one of our state Medicaid programs will result in a loss of approximately 140,000 members in that state in the third quarter. This was known as of last year and was factored into our 2023 planning and initial membership guidance. Second quarter operating revenue of $43.4 billion increased $4.9 billion or approximately 12.7% year-over-year. Growth was driven by premium rate increases to cover overall trend in our Health Benefits businesses, along with higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid and Medicare. Our services business, Carelon, continues to produce strong results with double digit top-line growth in CarelonRx and Carelon Services, as we continue to execute on our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. Execution of our strategy is diversifying our revenue streams, creating greater earnings power and consistency, and enabling us to deliver strong growth regardless of the prevailing economic environment. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the second quarter was 86.4%, a meaningful improvement year-over-year, driven by premium rate adjustments in our commercial risk-based business to better reflect the post-pandemic medical cost structure, offset in part by a charge we took in the second quarter associated with a court ruling in a certain state holding health plans liable for certain COVID costs retroactive to the beginning of the pandemic. We strongly disagree with this ruling and it is currently on appeal, but we've recorded the potential charge in the meantime. With respect to our current performance, we of course are closely monitoring utilization and trend factors which remain consistent with our expectations overall and within each line of business. In the context of our upwardly revised guidance for adjusted earnings per share, we are reiterating our initial outlook for our full year consolidated benefit expense ratio. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 11% in the second quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by additional operating expenses in support of growth as we continue to execute our enterprise strategy. Operating gain for the enterprise grew 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, led by our Health Benefits business, which delivered double-digit top-line growth and strong margin improvement. Operating margin for our Health Benefits business expanded by 50 basis points year-over-year, consistent with our full year outlook despite absorbing the charge I mentioned earlier associated with the adverse court ruling in a certain state. Carelon delivered a strong quarter as well, with healthy top-line growth for CarelonRx and Carelon Services. CarelonRX operating earnings include investments in support of our strategy, including scaling our recently acquired specialty pharmacy and the build-out of our advanced home delivery business, which is set to launch later this year. CarelonRx also benefited from a favorable out-of-period item in the second quarter of 2022, which had the effect of depressing its year-on-year operating earnings growth rate this quarter. Carelon Services had a strong second quarter, led by organic growth in Carelon post-acute management. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 39.6%, in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average share price $457.34 for approximately $646 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.7 million shares for $1.3 billion, pacing ahead of our full year outlook of approximately $2 billion. We expect to remain opportunistic given recent weakness in our share price and the attractive valuation levels offered by the market. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 46.5 days at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 0.5 days sequentially and a decrease of 1.3 days year-over-year. As we disclosed in the second quarter of last year, the timing of certain provider pass-through payments and corresponding reserves had the effect of increasing days and claims payable by approximately 1.8 days in the prior year quarter. Excluding that dynamic, days and claims payable would have increased by 0.5 days year-over-year and medical claims payable would have grown by 11.9%, compared with growth in premium revenue of 10.6%. As a reminder, we continue to expect days and claims payable will be in the low-40 range long term and anticipate normalization towards this range in the coming years as cycle time shortened in COVID-related uncertainty receipts. Operating cash flow was approximately $2 billion or 1.1 times net income in the second quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, excluding an extra payment received from CMS, our operating cash flow was $4.9 billion or 1.3 times net income. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter and our year-to-date performance. As we look to the second half of the year, we are excited for the pending acquisition of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, the launch of our CarelonRx Pharmacy, a differentiated digital-first home delivery model and the continued scaling of BioPlus as it prepares to serve more Elevance Health members in early 2024. Given the strong start to the year, the diversity of our assets, and the balance and resilience of our enterprise, we have raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to greater than $32.85, reflecting growth that is consistent with our long-term target compound annual growth rate. We have consistently delivered on our financial commitments and have the conviction that we will continue to do so. We will remain focused on the execution of our strategy to become a lifetime trusted health partner by serving the whole health needs of the consumers we are privileged to serve. The better job we do serving our members, the better we will do for all of our stakeholders. With that, operator, we will now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Appreciate the good performance on the medical loss ratio line and that you're benefiting from your repricing in the commercial book, which you've been talking about for a while. You didn't really call out anything that's deviating from your underlying expectations relative to Medicare Advantage, commercial and Medicaid. I just wondered if you would maybe flush that out a little more. Are you seeing any trend changes or anything on the horizon? And how did you think about the MA bids in light of anything you saw there on the utilization front?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for the kind words, AJ, and good morning everyone. And I really do appreciate the question and the opportunity to provide clarity on these issues. We're obviously very pleased with our results for the second quarter, which is really following delivery of strong results also in the first quarter. And related to your question and the issues on trend, and I do think part of the confusion out there is trying to understand what is happening versus what is expected or what was expected. And as we've noted previously, when you combine COVID and non-COVID cost, the overall cost of the healthcare system is more expensive than if COVID had never occurred, something we've been talking about and analyzing and stating for a while now. So given that fact, we had already included the elevated cost structure into our pricing, into our projections and into our guidance. And quite honestly, this is true for all lines of business within the Health Benefits segment. So if you look at the first and second quarter in particular, there really isn't anything all that surprising or all that different from our overall expectations. Cost continued to be higher when compared to a baseline as if COVID never existed. So we obviously are very well positioned. And as you know, based on this morning's call, we raised our guidance by $0.15 to $32.85 per share. And those expectations fall solidly within our 12% to 15% compound annual long-term growth rate target. But I think just as importantly, as you heard in my prepared comments, we reaffirmed our original guidance for the full year 2023 benefit expense ratio. So, anyway, thanks for the question, AJ. And, operator, next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yeah. Could you talk a little bit about in Carelon, the combination of where you're getting those wins, the types of organizations you're winning with, the self-insured employers or other Blues, and then where you are as far as the build-out of the pharmacy capabilities, the advanced home delivery and how if at all that impacts your re-contracting -- upcoming re-contracting for PBM? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks very much, Lance, for the question. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian address it, but I think you hit a couple of key areas around Carelon on both Services and Rx where we feel that we're advancing the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day and feel really good about the progress. So Pete, why don't you talk about both of those areas?\nPeter Haytaian: Yeah. Thanks, Gail, and thanks, Lance. I really appreciate the question. And you know this, we've talked a lot about it, but a big part of our strategy is obviously to focus on managing high cost, high trends areas. Gail talked about it today in her prepared remarks. And then obviously, capitating risk down to -- through Elevance -- with Elevance Health first in mind, and we are -- part of our strategy was to drive that value through Elevance Health first and then have that translate externally. And we are seeing that play through very, very nicely. I'll give you a sense of quickly what's happening internally and then, Lance, to your question how that translates externally. Internally, we're working very closely with the P&L. And we continue to accelerate a lot of opportunity. We talked about finalizing the post-acute care initiative this year. That's over 1.2 million Medicare members. We just launched a new durable medical equipment offering as well with our Medicare business and we're expanding that to commercial. And in our medical benefits management, which was formerly AIM, we've insourced a lot of critical services around genetic testing and things like oncology. So a lot of energy around that and then of course the behavioral health, physical health opportunity and assuming full risk on that is a tremendous opportunity as well. And interestingly enough, we are have -- where we're having a lot of success internally, that is actually translating in our external pipeline, and specifically with the Blues. As we talk about the Blues and they see us having a lot of confidence and good performance internally in Elevance, they're interested in some of those same solutions. So I would say at the top of the list, when you look at our pipeline and the growth in our pipeline, the home solutions through myNEXUS, an uphold of Carelon post-acute care solutions, is getting a lot of visibility. The post-acute care offering that we just launched in our Medicare business internally is also driving a lot of excitement in the pipeline. And I would also say that there is a decent amount of interest in some of the innovations around payment integrity. So I think a lot of opportunity, not only still internally, but that will translate as it relates to the Blues. As it relates to advanced home delivery and the launch of CarelonRx Pharmacy, that was the second part of your question, again, really, really excited about this initiative. And as we've talked about overall for our pharmacy strategy, its aim is to source the strategic levers that really matter. And we're doing that both with obviously what we're doing in specialty and in sourcing this activity. But I wouldn't look at this as only in-sourcing mail. I would look at it more broadly in terms of what we're trying to do to get closer to the member and differentiate in terms of our experience overall with our consumers. Think of the capabilities that we're deploying. Number one, this is going to be connected to Sydney, our consumer engagement platform. There's going to be a convenient quick scheduling of medications. If you think about access to pharmacists and how critical that is, we're going to have access to a pharmacist 24/7. So that's a big differentiator. And then importantly, I think a lot of people know that the experience with mail isn't necessarily always smooth. And so we're going to have an easy view of where delivery stands, an Uber-like experience, quite frankly. So you know where your pharmaceutical stand in terms of their delivery. So a lot in that regard in terms of really differentiating ourselves on experience and we're excited about that. And as Gail said, we're ready to launch that heading into 2024.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. Thank you, Pete. As you can hear from the excitement I think from Pete and all the things we're doing about Carelon Services and CarelonRx, there's a lot going on to really build our strategy and I think execute on it. And I guess I would just punctuate two things that Pete talked about. One, the behavioral health area. We really see ourselves as a leader in the crisis management area as well as we're seeing a lot of internal or external validated -- validity of that strategy. And I think starting to pull through not just in its historic government business, but also on the commercial side where they're integrating physical and behavioral in particular, which is a core part of our whole health strategy. And then on the pharmacy side, again, we're really trying to make sure that the value and strategic levers are coming through and you heard that in what Pete talked about. So thanks for the question, Lance, and next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. First, just wanted to follow-up on AJ's question to see if you can give us a little color. You're saying trend is above normal and you priced for it. We appreciate that color. Just any kind of incremental that you can give us on how much higher and what you've seen in 1Q to 2Q might be helpful? And then my question is just take that to the margin side, right, can you tell us how margins are running versus the expectations coming into the year? I know you had expected improvement in Medicare and commercial and obviously some volatility in Medicaid. Can you tell us how those are running in specifically, anything on Medicare beyond Puerto Rico issues you discussed in the second quarter would be helpful? Thanks. Or how that's trending?\nJohn Gallina: Yeah. Thank you for the question, Justin. And I'm happy to provide the follow-up. As I said, I'll start out by reiterating, we did raise our EPS guidance and proactively reaffirmed MLR guidance for the year. So I think that actually has a hoard view of trend inherent in it. Yeah. But having said that, I'm not so sure that we're really seeing anything that much differently than some other folks have been saying. We've been expecting the cost of healthcare to be elevated compared to the baseline as if COVID never existed. I'm not going to provide a specific point estimate, but only to say that we've seen it, we've priced for it and we've included and factored it into our expectations. And this is the second time this year we've raised guidance and reaffirming the MLR outlook. So I think we're in pretty good position. Associated with the margins, commercial is doing very well. I'll start out with Health Benefits in total. That's our Health Benefits segment. Margins improved 50 basis points year-over-year and are on track to hit the guidance of greater than -- improvement of 30 basis points to 60 basis points. I do want to note in my prepared comments, I had a comment about a court ruling that we disagree with that we took a charge. Without that charge, the margin improvement would have been higher than the high end of the 30 basis point to 60 basis point improvement year-over-year. So Health Benefits margins are going quite well. Commercial repricing effort, Medicaid is very much in line with expectations and Medicare Advantage is actually relatively in line with expectations aside from the one geography that have been pointed out that really is not all that material or significant to the overall results of Elevance Health. But it's an area that we're focused on and there will obviously be improvement opportunities for 2024. So, all in, we are very pleased with our performance and very bullish on our expectations for the rest of the year.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. Thanks, John, and thanks for the questions, Justin. I think it's important we've been very consistent all year. We haven't changed our view of how we see MLR and feel very comfortable as John said in the guidance that we gave and where we're heading on margins. So thanks again for the question and opportunity to comment. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Ha from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ha: All right. Thank you. Regarding Medicaid redetermination, fully appreciate -- understand how it's too early to really extrapolate any current results. But thus far, number one, how's the acuity mix shift tracking relative to your expectations? Number two, how do you view this enrollment so far? Florida looks positive, but the recent Texas data, does that concern you at all? Number three, with the number of states going through mid-year rate renewals, are you seeing acuity adjustments in these draft rates and would that represent upside to your guidance? Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government business to comment on Medicaid. Thanks.\nFelicia Norwood: So, Michael, good morning. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about redeterminations where our teams have certainly spent quite a bit of time trying to make sure that individuals who are eligible for Medicaid continue to maintain their eligibility. So it is still very early. And it's important that we don't draw conclusions based on a few months in, because the redetermination cycle is going to extend well into 2024. And with that said, I will say what we have seen so far is certainly relative -- consistent with our expectations, albeit with a great deal of variability as you go from state to state. At the end of the day, however, we still believe that the guidance that we provided is certainly appropriate. As you know, CMS gave states guidelines to really do this over a 14-month period. But at the end of the day, states are taking their own approach, and some of those have certainly front-loaded or accelerated the redetermination process based on members that they believe are no longer eligible. As we take a look at this today, we do expect that many of these members will return to Medicaid once we continue our outreach, and they're able to provide the documentation to the states that they need. So when we look at where we are today, those members could come back over a 30 or 90-day period and we are very much focused on advocacy with our community-based organizations, our care provider partners, the federally qualified health centers, all of those entities that impact our members every single day. With that said, I will say that some of the front-loading that occurred, has happened in some of the states where we don't have Elevance Health in terms of a Blue state platform. And so we haven't fully seen the appreciation of our catcher's mitt, but we are fully prepared in collaboration with our commercial partners to be able to do that. In terms of your question with respect to rates, we are always fully engaged with our state partners in terms of the rate setting process. At this point, we have visibility into almost all of our rates for 2023 and many of them for \u201824. What we are seeing so far is in line with our expectations. States are certainly taking acuity into the rate setting process that we see. And certainly they have the ability to work collaboratively with us if we see things that they don't see. But our early reads on acuity for our kind of leavers versus our stayers is in line with the expectations that we've seen so far. So at this point, we feel good about where we are from a rate perspective for 2023. The collaboration with our state partners remains strong. Shifts in acuity are now our standard input into the rate setting process. So we've been very much pleased with how that's going with our state partners. And we will continue to work very strongly to make sure that individuals who are truly eligible for Medicaid continue to have access to coverage. And those who aren't, that they are able to have coverage through one of our exchange or commercial based products. So thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. So Michael, as you heard from Felicia, there's a lot there and there's incredible work across our enterprise going into this. But overall, it's aligned very closely with the expectations we set. So thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. The margin pressure in Carelon year-over-year I saw on the press release was attributed to higher medical cost trends and the non-recurrence of an out-of-period favorable adjustment last year. Could you just explain the higher medical cost and maybe what specific line items that is, if that's behavioral or Rx or something?\nPeter Haytaian: Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh. It's Pete Haytaian here. First of all, in terms of Carelon\u2019s overall -- the Carelon Services overall performance from an operating perspective, we're very pleased. Op gains saw a nice improvement year-over-year. And just to be clear, as it relates to our margin profile for the year, we're very confident in achieving the 25 basis points to 50 basis points guidance that we gave in terms of margin improvement over the year. In terms of the variation there, a lot of this has to do with seasonality and as seasonality continues to evolve, we are sort of seeing differences there. This year, what's different than previous years is we're driving a lot more business through the government business. So as I talked about in my earlier comments, in terms of the post-acute care initiative with our Medicare teams, as well as the durable medical equipment opportunity, these are examples of things where we're driving a lot more business through the government business and that's translating into earnings really being weighted to the back half of the year. So that's where the difference is. In terms of the one-time issue, I think you're probably referencing pharmacy. And in the case of pharmacy again to speak about how we're performing there, we're very pleased overall with how that's going in terms of our margin performance. The 6% to 6.5% range in terms of margin performance for the year and guidance that we gave, we still feel very comfortable with that. The one-time issue that occurred in terms of the year-over-year difference, Q2 \u201822 versus this year, was a one-time favorable positive impact that we experienced in pharmacy last year that we're not seeing this year. But overall, pharmacy is performing very, very well. And we feel very comfortable with the 6% to 6.5% guidance for the year.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Yeah. Good morning, guys. As it relates to Medicare Advantage, I'm wondering if we can kind of revisit an old topic, which is the changes to the risk model that CMS announced at the beginning of April. I guess as you guys have had more time to kind of digest the proposed risk model changes, can you talk a little bit about how it makes you guys think about \u201924 just as some of your peers have kind of talked about the risk model kind of driving meaningful changes to kind of both benefit design and the bid process? We would love any update you could provide around that.\nFelicia Norwood: Good morning, George. It's Felicia Norwood. If we take a look at the risk model changes for 2024, they certainly were an integral part of our strategy as we thought about our bid process. But let me start by saying that we feel good about our bids for 2024. I believe when we step back and take a look at where we are, we continue to recognize the importance of stability in our offerings to seniors. And I think that we have submitted bids that take into consideration both the risk model changes as well as the importance of having those benefits that are critical to seniors as we go forward. It's always going to be a very highly competitive environment in Medicare Advantage. We always expect that. But from our perspective, this is something that we've had the opportunity to be very thoughtful about. And as we put our bids together each year, we're always taking a very balanced approach between our aspirations for growth as well as with respect to margins. And I think that we have landed in a place where we're going to be offering attractive plans for our seniors that provide sustainable economics for us for the long term. So thank you very much for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. I just want to go back to a comment that John made. And that's around higher cost if COVID never happened. And so, one, I just want to understand, is there a pent-up demand because of COVID? Is that the reason for that comment? And then secondly, both at your Analyst Day and I think at another conference, you called out GLP-1s is running higher. Can you maybe just put that into perspective for us as to how much that can add to a medical cost trend? And does that benefit your pharmacy side of your benefit business as you see that higher utilization?\nJohn Gallina: Thanks for the question, Lisa, and good morning. Yeah, associated with trends and COVID existing versus not existing and what the baseline might have been, it's really not a lot of pent-up demand for care. There certainly can be small pockets of that. But in general, the healthcare system was pretty much open for business quite significantly in 2022. There may have been some staffing shortages that impacted that ever so slightly, but not all that significantly, we don't believe. And we just think that it's really -- it's an overall increasing in cost structure. COVID is not gone. It still exists. It's just no longer the big significant driving force that it had been for the past several years. And so as we look at things in total, we see a higher cost structure in general. And then associated with GLP-1 drugs, that is one element of a multitude of elements as part of an overall trend conversation. And as I said, trend overall is consistent with our expectation. So we feel very good about that. And can there be an upside on CarelonRx? Well, certainly a small one, but not enough to really change the trajectory at this point. So thank you for the questions.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. I just want to go back to redeterminations and how you're thinking about that. I think you said that you expected to keep about 40% to 45% of the Medicaid redetermination growth, which I think is something close to about a 4% CAGRs into 2019, which seems a little high to me given that total employment is up about 3 million over that time period. So can you just maybe refresh how you're thinking about keeping those people, why they'll stay on and then maybe the other 55%, if you can kind of give an update on anything you're seeing there about how those people re-enroll and through the year how we should expect then to come on? You mentioned some delays. Is there a way to think about Q2 disenrollment, when do they show up on either employer coverage or the exchanges? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. Associated with the 40% to 45%, I'm not positive about the CAGR you're looking at from \u201819 and exactly what's in the baseline and what all the thought processes are versus qualifications and eligibility requirements. But as we do our review in our work and certainly access a lot of independent studies as well, we feel very comfortable that we believe that 40% to 45% will stay on. And that's really a projection for what will be the ultimate result a year from now after the entire redetermination process occurs and things shake out. So I think it's a very reasonable expectation and we feel very good about it. And then in terms of the overall coverage patterns, everything else, one thing to point out that might be inherent in your question is as we look at the second quarter of 2023, actually many of our states, Medicaid states that are not Blue states, actually went a little bit earlier on in the beginning of the redetermination. So everybody will have started redeterminations by now. But when you look at who started in the April, May timeframe, for us, it was more heavily weighted to the states that are not our Blue states. So we still feel very good about our overall catcher's mitt and the fact that we think 20% to 25% of these folks will ultimately end up on employer sponsored plans, 20% to 25% will ultimately end up in an individual ACA product, 40% to 45% will stay on Medicaid. And that's what we're tracking to and we actually have some insights into the states that are starting in June, it looks very promising that our thought process is going to be validated. So thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks. And the only thing I'd add to that is, again, there's a timing lag here, but we feel our expectations are very much aligned. And we are seeing, particularly in the individual change, that -- early states that our applications are up at a much higher rate than they were prior to redeterminations, which you would expect and given our commercial market share in our Blue states. So very well positioned in the ACA market for those that will ultimately not keep Medicaid coverage. But again, as I shared in my early remarks, we're working really hard to make sure that everyone who's going through this process in conjunction with our state partners understands the options that are available to us. And that's been very positive. We're seeing a lot of really good uptake and we're actually contacting, having great success rates in contacting individuals where we have the information. So those are very encouraging early signs to us. And again, we'll continue to update as we get through this process because many of the states are really just in the throes of it, certainly our Blue states. But, thanks very much for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. I was hoping first you could just maybe touch on the EPS split expected for 3Q versus 4Q. And then my main question is just sort of taking the discussion we're having on the cost structure for medical costs in 2023, just interested in how you're thinking about that rolling forward into 2024. We're already starting to capture a lot of early data points on commercial premium pricing and it looks like the environment is hardening quite a bit in terms of pricing trends. And so just interested in how you're sort of thinking about sort of pricing for cost trends for \u201924? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Yeah. Thanks for the question, and good morning. In terms of our EPS, guidance, as you know, we raised it to $32.85 or greater than $32.85. And I think that would assume that a little bit more than 56% of our earnings will have occurred in the first half of the year. So when you look at the last six months of the year, we are actually pretty comfortable with what the current consensus estimates have associated with the third quarter and with the seasonality that the current consensus estimates have inherent in it. And that is that the third quarter will be a bit more profitable than the fourth quarter which is very consistent with the typical seasonality of our business. And then for \u201824, as you know, it's just really premature to go into a 2024 conversation at this time. We'll provide a lot more insights on that at the end of the year, a little bit more in the third quarter and a lot more at the end of the year and have a more robust conversation about 2024 at that time.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah, thanks again for that question. And again on just your pricing question, we've got a very consistent approach to pricing and we're going to keep that discipline as we project our forward view of cost. So I don't think anything has changed though. There's not a whole lot more that's new, but we're very disciplined about our projection and how we see that and that's how we price to. So thanks for the question and next question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Thanks. Good morning. This was touched on a little bit with your comment though that commercial membership growth should re-accelerate in the back half of \u201823 and into \u201924. Just curious if you could remind us whether or not that's due almost all to the potential tailwinds for redetermination or are there other factors that are just -- either such as a more favorable market dynamics related to low unemployment or any potential expectation of market share gains for Elevance for \u201824 that might help your commercial membership growth acceleration outlook? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. I'll ask Morgan Kendrick, who leads Commercial business maybe to comment a little bit about commercial and what we're seeing in the marketplace.\nMorgan Kendrick: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. Morgan here. I wanted to address -- I\u2019d say that our expectations for membership growth are in line with what we projected and discussed at other instances. One of the things that's interesting though is we're wrapping up our national cycle. And so that's almost complete. One thing notably this year, it felt like the receipts were coming in slower or later and the actual decisions were made longer, which isn't terribly inconsistent with what we see during an economic shift if you think of things and where the affordability really matters. Our local market right now, we're just now getting into 4Q when we think about our business, and 3Q, 4Q and then [1,1] (ph), all of which look promising. We've gotten into some of the bigger lower market wins for next year and we're pleased with how the assets are resonating. And when go back and speak to national, we've had just an unbelievable run for the past several years. That's not different this year, but we've talked many times about each one of these cycles have nuances. There are three things that I think are important to note. Number one, this cycle for us when we think about our largest employers that will be in the end of the year into next year, there was a very, very large cohort of in force business. So this was a very strong retention year for our company that's been quite successful, which again reinforces how the assets are being resonating with some of the most discerning buyers in the country. Secondly, our win share continues at the rate that we've seen, albeit on a lower pipeline and smaller case count. But then lastly, I think the notable conclusion of the notable piece that we've shared in the past several years, we're continuing to see strong growth internally where employers are consolidating their benefit partners from one vendor -- from multiple vendors to one. So that's continuing with us. So all in, we feel good about our continued trajectory in the business. And as noted earlier our pricing activities continue with our forward view of trend. So we're quite optimistic at this point. Thank you again for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Morgan. And again, just reiterating something that Morgan just said, I think is important is the consolidation trend where we become single source has been accelerating in the last few years and we continue to see that. That's a notable trend this year. And I think what's important is we're also seeing it not just in medical coverage but beginning to consolidate with Carelon Services as well. So that's a very positive trend for the strategy around whole health that we laid out. Thank you. Next question. I think this will be our last question.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask on the CarelonRx margins. I think they were down sequentially from the first quarter. Could you maybe just elaborate a bit more on what drove that margin step-down? I know you had BioPlus rolling in. But do you still expect margins to be flattish for the full year? And then on biosimilars, how has the pricing of biosimilar Humira come in relative to expectations? And is that a significant swing factor to kind of in the outlook for that segment?\nPeter Haytaian: Yeah, Nathan. Thanks for the question. This is Pete. Again, when we think about our operating performance in CarelonRx, I'll just say upfront, we're confident in our pharmacy business. And if you exclude BioPlus, we will come in at that 6% to 6.5% range. So flattish as we talked about. And as Gail mentioned in her prepared remarks, we're continuing to invest and things like BioPlus and advanced home delivery. BioPlus, our original guidance did not include BioPlus. And so that as we talked about that, that's had a bit of dilution. But again, outside of BioPlus, we're very confident in coming in into the 6% to 6.5% range. As it relates to your question on Humira and biosimilars, again, as we said, we're very excited about biosimilars coming into the marketplace and how that's going to drive overall cost and affordability down the road. We and CarelonRx have been very, very focused on driving lowest net cost. We obviously were well aware of what occurred in July in terms of the launches and we've been staying very, very close to that. And as we've said before, we have historically supported biosimilars alongside our reference brand. On Humira, we do expect to include a biosimilar or biosimilars in a similar formulary position as Humira this year. We're not going to go into more specifics in terms of timing or specifically what we're going to do, but we will do that. And I would finally say that with the addition of BioPlus in our portfolio, I think we're now in a much better position to directly manage specialty pharmacy more holistically. So appreciate your questions.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Pete. Now I'd like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased with our performance year to date and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us well for the balance of 2023 and in the years to come. Through a steadfast focus on whole health and our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we'll continue to meet the needs of clients, consumers and communities we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. Thank you all for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 AM today through August 18, 2023.

            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, Gail, and thanks, Lance. I really appreciate the question. And you know this, we've talked a lot about it, but a big part of our strategy is obviously to focus on managing high cost, high trends areas. Gail talked about it today in her prepared remarks. And then obviously, capitating risk down to -- through Elevance -- with Elevance Health first in mind, and we are -- part of our strategy was to drive that value through Elevance Health first and then have that translate externally. And we are seeing that play through very, very nicely. I'll give you a sense of quickly what's happening internally and then, Lance, to your question how that translates externally. Internally, we're working very closely with the P&L. And we continue to accelerate a lot of opportunity. We talked about finalizing the post-acute care initiative this year. That's over 1.2 million Medicare members. We just launched a new durable medical equipment offering as well with our Medicare business and we're expanding that to commercial. And in our medical benefits management, which was formerly AIM, we've insourced a lot of critical services around genetic testing and things like oncology. So a lot of energy around that and then of course the behavioral health, physical health opportunity and assuming full risk on that is a tremendous opportunity as well. And interestingly enough, we are have -- where we're having a lot of success internally, that is actually translating in our external pipeline, and specifically with the Blues. As we talk about the Blues and they see us having a lot of confidence and good performance internally in Elevance, they're interested in some of those same solutions. So I would say at the top of the list, when you look at our pipeline and the growth in our pipeline, the home solutions through myNEXUS, an uphold of Carelon post-acute care solutions, is getting a lot of visibility. The post-acute care offering that we just launched in our Medicare business internally is also driving a lot of excitement in the pipeline. And I would also say that there is a decent amount of interest in some of the innovations around payment integrity. So I think a lot of opportunity, not only still internally, but that will translate as it relates to the Blues. As it relates to advanced home delivery and the launch of CarelonRx Pharmacy, that was the second part of your question, again, really, really excited about this initiative. And as we've talked about overall for our pharmacy strategy, its aim is to source the strategic levers that really matter. And we're doing that both with obviously what we're doing in specialty and in sourcing this activity. But I wouldn't look at this as only in-sourcing mail. I would look at it more broadly in terms of what we're trying to do to get closer to the member and differentiate in terms of our experience overall with our consumers. Think of the capabilities that we're deploying. Number one, this is going to be connected to Sydney, our consumer engagement platform. There's going to be a convenient quick scheduling of medications. If you think about access to pharmacists and how critical that is, we're going to have access to a pharmacist 24/7. So that's a big differentiator. And then importantly, I think a lot of people know that the experience with mail isn't necessarily always smooth. And so we're going to have an easy view of where delivery stands, an Uber-like experience, quite frankly. So you know where your pharmaceutical stand in terms of their delivery. So a lot in that regard in terms of really differentiating ourselves on experience and we're excited about that. And as Gail said, we're ready to launch that heading into 2024. Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh. It's Pete Haytaian here. First of all, in terms of Carelon's overall -- the Carelon Services overall performance from an operating perspective, we're very pleased. Op gains saw a nice improvement year-over-year. And just to be clear, as it relates to our margin profile for the year, we're very confident in achieving the 25 basis points to 50 basis points guidance that we gave in terms of margin improvement over the year. In terms of the variation there, a lot of this has to do with seasonality and as seasonality continues to evolve, we are sort of seeing differences there. This year, what's different than previous years is we're driving a lot more business through the government business. So as I talked about in my earlier comments, in terms of the post-acute care initiative with our Medicare teams, as well as the durable medical equipment opportunity, these are examples of things where we're driving a lot more business through the government business and that's translating into earnings really being weighted to the back half of the year.

The 6% to 6.5% range in terms of margin performance for the year and guidance that we gave, we still feel very comfortable with that. The one-time issue that occurred in terms of the year-over-year difference, Q2 \u201822 versus this year, was a one-time favorable positive impact that we experienced in pharmacy last year that we're not seeing this year. But overall, pharmacy is performing very, very well. And we feel very comfortable with the 6% to 6.5% guidance for the year. Yeah, Nathan. Thanks for the question. This is Pete. Again, when we think about our operating performance in CarelonRx, I'll just say upfront, we're confident in our pharmacy business.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we are pleased to share that Elevance Health delivered strong second quarter results, driven by solid execution and continued progress towards our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner, focused on the whole health needs of the consumers we are privileged to serve. Second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $7.79 and adjusted earnings per share was $9.04, reflecting double-digit growth year-over-year as a result of the strong performance in the first half of the year and momentum across Elevance Health. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year to be greater than $32.85. The balance and resilience of our diverse businesses provides confidence in our near-term outlook, while the earnings power of our Health Benefits and Carelon businesses position us to deliver on our long-term growth commitments. With respect to the second quarter, our Health Benefits business delivered particularly strong results as we continued to optimize our products, pricing and operations. We are successfully executing against the planned margin recovery of our commercial risk and Medicare Advantage businesses back toward pre-pandemic levels, and we are pleased with the performance of our Medicaid business. With Medicaid eligibility redeterminations now underway, our teams are working tirelessly to promote continuity of coverage for consumers through an omni-channel approach, working closely with our state partners. Our Medicaid and commercial colleagues are collaborating to educate members and communities on the process through in-person and online events, ensuring members know how to renew their Medicaid coverage when eligible or enroll in other forms of coverage, including our own individual ACA plans. To date, we have contacted more than 1.5 million of our Medicaid members. Meanwhile, our web-based digital decision support tool is seeing healthy utilization. The tool assesses eligibility for a wide variety of federal and state programs beyond health insurance to support consumers' whole health journey, including the federal supplemental nutrition assistance program, state-based programs that assist with food and security, housing and childcare programs, and more, with links that can route consumers to websites where they can enroll in these programs. More than half of the people using our support tool who qualify for commercial or Medicare coverage are clicking through embedded links to shop for plans and more than 60% of consumers eligible for Medicaid are clicking through to their state site for recertification. This body of work is especially important since many of the people who have lost access to Medicaid so far are losing it for administrative reasons. We expect many of these consumer will re-enroll in Medicaid over time. Transitions of coverage are not typically immediate. But emerging data points suggest consumers losing Medicaid are starting to transition onto ACA exchange plans. It's still early in the process and our expectations for coverage transitions remain unchanged. Our deep local roots and diversified product portfolio positions us uniquely well to meet consumers' needs regardless of age or socioeconomic status. Carelon continued to advance its strategy of integrating physical, behavioral, social, and pharmacy services to deliver whole health affordably, with ongoing investments and capabilities focused on serving people across their entire healthcare journey, connecting them to the care, support, and resources they need. Carelon Services delivered solid organic growth led by the expansion of post-acute care management solutions with our Medicare health plans. While Carelon Behavioral Health extended its leadership position through multiple external business wins with new and existing customers, new business awards and successful execution in these fast growing high-cost areas of trend underscore the value Carelon provides to health plans and the expanding earnings power and attractive growth profile of the Carelon Services business. CarelonRx also continued to grow nicely while investing in key value drivers. Specifically, specialty pharmacy and advanced home delivery revenue grew nearly 20% year-over-year and we posted solid operating earnings while absorbing investments in support of our long-term strategy. The integration of the BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy is now tracking ahead of schedule and we expect to begin migrating scripts early next year. Additionally, we remain on track to launch advanced home delivery by the end of 2023. Together, these capabilities will create additional shareholder value while allowing us to deliver even better consumer experiences in specialty and maintenance pharmacy. Expanding and more deeply integrating value-based care across the care continuum is foundational to our enterprise strategy. We are making significant progress in many key areas, including maternal health, where we have continued to expand our obstetrics practice consultants and quality incentive programs to additional markets given outstanding early results. These programs have helped improve timeliness to and adequacy of prenatal care and increased postpartum visit compliance, contributing to a reduction in pre-term births of 12% and low-birth weight deliveries of 20% in participating Medicaid populations. These programs have driven cost savings per delivery and first-year mom and baby costs of 5% to 10% and we are now offering them in 24 Medicaid and 11 commercial markets across the country. We're also working with care provider partners to enable acute care in the home, a patient centered care alternative to traditional care in the hospital that improves cost, quality and patient experiences. For select patients, acute care at home is safe, improves patient satisfaction and provides high value care, resulting in approximately a 20% reduction in cost, a 25% decrease in readmissions and a 50% reduction in time spent in bed. We have partnerships with a number of major health systems in our markets with strong results and have significant interest from other health systems to expand this work. Connectivity with care provider partners is crucial to supporting our value-based care strategy and to enabling personalized hybrid and virtual care. We are continuing to expand bi-directional data exchanges between our systems and care providers EMRs. Across 24 markets, we are now connected with over 1,700 hospitals. In addition to enabling physicians practice value-based care more effectively, these arrangements have simplified common business practices, resulting in more than 60% fewer requests for clinical information and more than 80% less provider appeals. This has not only enhanced operating efficiency for our clinicians and care provider partners, it has also accelerated care approval processes for consumers. Automation remains an area of focus and opportunity across Elevance Health and deep data sets like ours are foundational for generative artificial intelligence. Our data is centralized and cleansed and we are in the process of scaling digital solutions for greater impact and testing the application of new technologies. We're harnessing our adaptive artificial intelligent solution to promote identification and access to whole health services during physical health procedures like surgery. Our approach allows us to cast a broad net to perform initial screenings for depression and other social drivers of health to ensure we are addressing our members' whole health needs. Our digital chronic concierge care program is a cloud-based care management platform that connects the patient's entire care management team to triage, monitor and engage with patients through convenient digital channels. Fully digital enrollment, engagement and support, alongside key behavioral health components, provides members with highly personalized proactive, concierge-like experiences, while reducing the overall cost of care for members with chronic conditions. We're also using large language models to assist our call center agents, improving their efficiency, accuracy and quality. We're excited about these opportunities and the positive impacts they will have on consumers, care provider partners and the operating efficiency of Elevance Health. Guided by our enterprise strategy, we are fueled by a passion for making a positive difference in the world. Accordingly, environmental, social and governance frameworks are embedded in our enterprise strategy. We continue to lead our sector with respect to ESG ratings from three of the most prominent corporate governance research, ratings and analytics firms. And we were pleased that USA Today recently ranked Elevance Health fifth out of 400 organizations in its inaugural America's Climate Leaders, based on core emissions reductions year-over-year and core greenhouse gas reductions. Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to thank our more than 100,000 associates for the works that they do every day on behalf of the members we are privileged to serve. Their dedication is what allows us to advance our strategy and deliver strong operating results in service of our bold purpose to improve the health of humanity. Collectively, our passion to improve lives and communities is unwavering. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? Thanks very much, Lance, for the question. I'm going to have Pete Haytaian address it, but I think you hit a couple of key areas around Carelon on both Services and Rx where we feel that we're advancing the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day and feel really good about the progress. So Pete, why don't you talk about both of those areas? Yeah. Thank you, Pete. As you can hear from the excitement I think from Pete and all the things we're doing about Carelon Services and CarelonRx, there's a lot going on to really build our strategy and I think execute on it. And I guess I would just punctuate two things that Pete talked about. One, the behavioral health area. We really see ourselves as a leader in the crisis management area as well as we're seeing a lot of internal or external validated -- validity of that strategy. And I think starting to pull through not just in its historic government business, but also on the commercial side where they're integrating physical and behavioral in particular, which is a core part of our whole health strategy. And then on the pharmacy side, again, we're really trying to make sure that the value and strategic levers are coming through and you heard that in what Pete talked about. So thanks for the question, Lance, and next question please. Yeah. Thanks, John, and thanks for the questions, Justin. I think it's important we've been very consistent all year. We haven't changed our view of how we see MLR and feel very comfortable as John said in the guidance that we gave and where we're heading on margins. So thanks again for the question and opportunity to comment. Next question please. I'm going to ask Felicia Norwood, who leads our Government business to comment on Medicaid. Thanks. Yeah. So Michael, as you heard from Felicia, there's a lot there and there's incredible work across our enterprise going into this. But overall, it's aligned very closely with the expectations we set. So thank you for the question. Next question, please. Thank you. Thank you. Next question, please. Next question please. Thanks. And the only thing I'd add to that is, again, there's a timing lag here, but we feel our expectations are very much aligned. And we are seeing, particularly in the individual change, that -- early states that our applications are up at a much higher rate than they were prior to redeterminations, which you would expect and given our commercial market share in our Blue states. So very well positioned in the ACA market for those that will ultimately not keep Medicaid coverage. But again, as I shared in my early remarks, we're working really hard to make sure that everyone who's going through this process in conjunction with our state partners understands the options that are available to us. And that's been very positive. We're seeing a lot of really good uptake and we're actually contacting, having great success rates in contacting individuals where we have the information. So those are very encouraging early signs to us. And again, we'll continue to update as we get through this process because many of the states are really just in the throes of it, certainly our Blue states. But, thanks very much for the question. Next question please. Yeah, thanks again for that question. And again on just your pricing question, we've got a very consistent approach to pricing and we're going to keep that discipline as we project our forward view of cost. So I don't think anything has changed though. There's not a whole lot more that's new, but we're very disciplined about our projection and how we see that and that's how we price to. So thanks for the question and next question. Sure. I'll ask Morgan Kendrick, who leads Commercial business maybe to comment a little bit about commercial and what we're seeing in the marketplace. Thanks, Morgan. And again, just reiterating something that Morgan just said, I think is important is the consolidation trend where we become single source has been accelerating in the last few years and we continue to see that. That's a notable trend this year. And I think what's important is we're also seeing it not just in medical coverage but beginning to consolidate with Carelon Services as well. So that's a very positive trend for the strategy around whole health that we laid out. Thank you. Next question. I think this will be our last question. Thank you, Pete. Now I'd like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased with our performance year to date and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us well for the balance of 2023 and in the years to come. Through a steadfast focus on whole health and our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we'll continue to meet the needs of clients, consumers and communities we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. Thank you all for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of week."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "So, Michael, good morning. Appreciate the opportunity to talk about redeterminations where our teams have certainly spent quite a bit of time trying to make sure that individuals who are eligible for Medicaid continue to maintain their eligibility. So it is still very early. And it's important that we don't draw conclusions based on a few months in, because the redetermination cycle is going to extend well into 2024. And with that said, I will say what we have seen so far is certainly relative -- consistent with our expectations, albeit with a great deal of variability as you go from state to state. At the end of the day, however, we still believe that the guidance that we provided is certainly appropriate. As you know, CMS gave states guidelines to really do this over a 14-month period. But at the end of the day, states are taking their own approach, and some of those have certainly front-loaded or accelerated the redetermination process based on members that they believe are no longer eligible. As we take a look at this today, we do expect that many of these members will return to Medicaid once we continue our outreach, and they're able to provide the documentation to the states that they need. So when we look at where we are today, those members could come back over a 30 or 90-day period and we are very much focused on advocacy with our community-based organizations, our care provider partners, the federally qualified health centers, all of those entities that impact our members every single day. With that said, I will say that some of the front-loading that occurred, has happened in some of the states where we don't have Elevance Health in terms of a Blue state platform. And so we haven't fully seen the appreciation of our catcher's mitt, but we are fully prepared in collaboration with our commercial partners to be able to do that. In terms of your question with respect to rates, we are always fully engaged with our state partners in terms of the rate setting process. At this point, we have visibility into almost all of our rates for 2023 and many of them for \u201824. What we are seeing so far is in line with our expectations. States are certainly taking acuity into the rate setting process that we see. And certainly they have the ability to work collaboratively with us if we see things that they don't see. But our early reads on acuity for our kind of leavers versus our stayers is in line with the expectations that we've seen so far. So at this point, we feel good about where we are from a rate perspective for 2023. The collaboration with our state partners remains strong. Shifts in acuity are now our standard input into the rate setting process. So we've been very much pleased with how that's going with our state partners. And we will continue to work very strongly to make sure that individuals who are truly eligible for Medicaid continue to have access to coverage. And those who aren't, that they are able to have coverage through one of our exchange or commercial based products. So thank you for the question. Good morning, George. It's Felicia Norwood. If we take a look at the risk model changes for 2024, they certainly were an integral part of our strategy as we thought about our bid process. But let me start by saying that we feel good about our bids for 2024. I believe when we step back and take a look at where we are, we continue to recognize the importance of stability in our offerings to seniors. And I think that we have submitted bids that take into consideration both the risk model changes as well as the importance of having those benefits that are critical to seniors as we go forward. It's always going to be a very highly competitive environment in Medicare Advantage. We always expect that. But from our perspective, this is something that we've had the opportunity to be very thoughtful about. And as we put our bids together each year, we're always taking a very balanced approach between our aspirations for growth as well as with respect to margins. And I think that we have landed in a place where we're going to be offering attractive plans for our seniors that provide sustainable economics for us for the long term. So thank you very much for the question."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong second quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $7.79 and adjusted earnings per share of $9.04. We were pleased to deliver another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and adjusted earnings per share, driven by the focused execution of our strategy. Our results exceeded our expectations and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses provides confidence in our outlook. As a result, we have increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance to be greater than $32.85 in 2023, reflecting strong growth consistent with our long-term targeted compound annual growth rate. We ended the second quarter with 48 million members, up 938,000 year-over-year. During the quarter, medical membership declined by 135,000 members as the majority of our Medicaid states initiated eligibility redeterminations. While we are still very early in the redetermination process, at this time, we are seeing many Medicaid members losing coverage for administrative reasons. Many of these consumers will likely re-enroll in Medicaid in the near to intermediate term. In fact, many Medicaid beneficiaries who lose coverage for administrative reasons have 30 to 90 days to re-enroll depending on the state with coverage retroactive to the termination date. Meanwhile, we are seeing encouraging early indications that Medicaid beneficiaries losing coverage are transitioning into ACA exchange plans. But transitions of coverage are not always immediate. And our expectation is that commercial membership growth will re-accelerate in the back half of this year and into 2024. Overall, we believe our prior outlook for coverage transitions remains appropriate. We continue to expect by the end of the initial redetermination cycle that 40% to 45% of net new beneficiaries on Medicaid as a result of the suspension of redeterminations during the public health emergency will stay on Medicaid. But most importantly, we are well positioned to provide people who lose Medicaid coverage with alternative plan offerings. We believe it is essential that these individuals have access to quality healthcare coverage and we are positioned to meet their needs. With respect to our membership outlook, please note that a new entrant into one of our state Medicaid programs will result in a loss of approximately 140,000 members in that state in the third quarter. This was known as of last year and was factored into our 2023 planning and initial membership guidance. Second quarter operating revenue of $43.4 billion increased $4.9 billion or approximately 12.7% year-over-year. Growth was driven by premium rate increases to cover overall trend in our Health Benefits businesses, along with higher premium revenue driven by membership growth in Medicaid and Medicare. Our services business, Carelon, continues to produce strong results with double digit top-line growth in CarelonRx and Carelon Services, as we continue to execute on our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. Execution of our strategy is diversifying our revenue streams, creating greater earnings power and consistency, and enabling us to deliver strong growth regardless of the prevailing economic environment. The consolidated benefit expense ratio for the second quarter was 86.4%, a meaningful improvement year-over-year, driven by premium rate adjustments in our commercial risk-based business to better reflect the post-pandemic medical cost structure, offset in part by a charge we took in the second quarter associated with a court ruling in a certain state holding health plans liable for certain COVID costs retroactive to the beginning of the pandemic. We strongly disagree with this ruling and it is currently on appeal, but we've recorded the potential charge in the meantime. With respect to our current performance, we of course are closely monitoring utilization and trend factors which remain consistent with our expectations overall and within each line of business. In the context of our upwardly revised guidance for adjusted earnings per share, we are reiterating our initial outlook for our full year consolidated benefit expense ratio. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 11% in the second quarter, down 10 basis points year-over-year. The decrease was driven by expense leverage associated with strong growth in operating revenue, partially offset by additional operating expenses in support of growth as we continue to execute our enterprise strategy. Operating gain for the enterprise grew 12% year-over-year in the second quarter, led by our Health Benefits business, which delivered double-digit top-line growth and strong margin improvement. Operating margin for our Health Benefits business expanded by 50 basis points year-over-year, consistent with our full year outlook despite absorbing the charge I mentioned earlier associated with the adverse court ruling in a certain state. Carelon delivered a strong quarter as well, with healthy top-line growth for CarelonRx and Carelon Services. CarelonRX operating earnings include investments in support of our strategy, including scaling our recently acquired specialty pharmacy and the build-out of our advanced home delivery business, which is set to launch later this year. CarelonRx also benefited from a favorable out-of-period item in the second quarter of 2022, which had the effect of depressing its year-on-year operating earnings growth rate this quarter. Carelon Services had a strong second quarter, led by organic growth in Carelon post-acute management. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 39.6%, in line with our expectations and consistent with our target range. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average share price $457.34 for approximately $646 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.7 million shares for $1.3 billion, pacing ahead of our full year outlook of approximately $2 billion. We expect to remain opportunistic given recent weakness in our share price and the attractive valuation levels offered by the market. We continue to maintain a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable stood at 46.5 days at the end of the second quarter, an increase of 0.5 days sequentially and a decrease of 1.3 days year-over-year. As we disclosed in the second quarter of last year, the timing of certain provider pass-through payments and corresponding reserves had the effect of increasing days and claims payable by approximately 1.8 days in the prior year quarter. Excluding that dynamic, days and claims payable would have increased by 0.5 days year-over-year and medical claims payable would have grown by 11.9%, compared with growth in premium revenue of 10.6%. As a reminder, we continue to expect days and claims payable will be in the low-40 range long term and anticipate normalization towards this range in the coming years as cycle time shortened in COVID-related uncertainty receipts. Operating cash flow was approximately $2 billion or 1.1 times net income in the second quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, excluding an extra payment received from CMS, our operating cash flow was $4.9 billion or 1.3 times net income. Overall, we are pleased with our second quarter and our year-to-date performance. As we look to the second half of the year, we are excited for the pending acquisition of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, the launch of our CarelonRx Pharmacy, a differentiated digital-first home delivery model and the continued scaling of BioPlus as it prepares to serve more Elevance Health members in early 2024. Given the strong start to the year, the diversity of our assets, and the balance and resilience of our enterprise, we have raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to greater than $32.85, reflecting growth that is consistent with our long-term target compound annual growth rate. We have consistently delivered on our financial commitments and have the conviction that we will continue to do so. We will remain focused on the execution of our strategy to become a lifetime trusted health partner by serving the whole health needs of the consumers we are privileged to serve. The better job we do serving our members, the better we will do for all of our stakeholders. With that, operator, we will now open up the line for questions. Thank you for the kind words, AJ, and good morning everyone. And I really do appreciate the question and the opportunity to provide clarity on these issues. We're obviously very pleased with our results for the second quarter, which is really following delivery of strong results also in the first quarter. And related to your question and the issues on trend, and I do think part of the confusion out there is trying to understand what is happening versus what is expected or what was expected. And as we've noted previously, when you combine COVID and non-COVID cost, the overall cost of the healthcare system is more expensive than if COVID had never occurred, something we've been talking about and analyzing and stating for a while now. So given that fact, we had already included the elevated cost structure into our pricing, into our projections and into our guidance. And quite honestly, this is true for all lines of business within the Health Benefits segment. So if you look at the first and second quarter in particular, there really isn't anything all that surprising or all that different from our overall expectations. Cost continued to be higher when compared to a baseline as if COVID never existed. So we obviously are very well positioned. And as you know, based on this morning's call, we raised our guidance by $0.15 to $32.85 per share. And those expectations fall solidly within our 12% to 15% compound annual long-term growth rate target. But I think just as importantly, as you heard in my prepared comments, we reaffirmed our original guidance for the full year 2023 benefit expense ratio. So, anyway, thanks for the question, AJ. And, operator, next question please. Yeah. Thank you for the question, Justin. And I'm happy to provide the follow-up. As I said, I'll start out by reiterating, we did raise our EPS guidance and proactively reaffirmed MLR guidance for the year. So I think that actually has a hoard view of trend inherent in it. Yeah. But having said that, I'm not so sure that we're really seeing anything that much differently than some other folks have been saying. We've been expecting the cost of healthcare to be elevated compared to the baseline as if COVID never existed. I'm not going to provide a specific point estimate, but only to say that we've seen it, we've priced for it and we've included and factored it into our expectations. And this is the second time this year we've raised guidance and reaffirming the MLR outlook. So I think we're in pretty good position. Associated with the margins, commercial is doing very well. I'll start out with Health Benefits in total. That's our Health Benefits segment. Margins improved 50 basis points year-over-year and are on track to hit the guidance of greater than -- improvement of 30 basis points to 60 basis points. I do want to note in my prepared comments, I had a comment about a court ruling that we disagree with that we took a charge. Without that charge, the margin improvement would have been higher than the high end of the 30 basis point to 60 basis point improvement year-over-year. So Health Benefits margins are going quite well. Commercial repricing effort, Medicaid is very much in line with expectations and Medicare Advantage is actually relatively in line with expectations aside from the one geography that have been pointed out that really is not all that material or significant to the overall results of Elevance Health. But it's an area that we're focused on and there will obviously be improvement opportunities for 2024. So, all in, we are very pleased with our performance and very bullish on our expectations for the rest of the year. Thanks for the question, Lisa, and good morning. Yeah, associated with trends and COVID existing versus not existing and what the baseline might have been, it's really not a lot of pent-up demand for care. There certainly can be small pockets of that. But in general, the healthcare system was pretty much open for business quite significantly in 2022. There may have been some staffing shortages that impacted that ever so slightly, but not all that significantly, we don't believe. And we just think that it's really -- it's an overall increasing in cost structure. COVID is not gone. It still exists. It's just no longer the big significant driving force that it had been for the past several years. And so as we look at things in total, we see a higher cost structure in general. And then associated with GLP-1 drugs, that is one element of a multitude of elements as part of an overall trend conversation. And as I said, trend overall is consistent with our expectation. So we feel very good about that. And can there be an upside on CarelonRx? Well, certainly a small one, but not enough to really change the trajectory at this point. So thank you for the questions. Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the question. Associated with the 40% to 45%, I'm not positive about the CAGR you're looking at from \u201819 and exactly what's in the baseline and what all the thought processes are versus qualifications and eligibility requirements. But as we do our review in our work and certainly access a lot of independent studies as well, we feel very comfortable that we believe that 40% to 45% will stay on. And that's really a projection for what will be the ultimate result a year from now after the entire redetermination process occurs and things shake out. So I think it's a very reasonable expectation and we feel very good about it. And then in terms of the overall coverage patterns, everything else, one thing to point out that might be inherent in your question is as we look at the second quarter of 2023, actually many of our states, Medicaid states that are not Blue states, actually went a little bit earlier on in the beginning of the redetermination. So everybody will have started redeterminations by now. But when you look at who started in the April, May timeframe, for us, it was more heavily weighted to the states that are not our Blue states. So we still feel very good about our overall catcher's mitt and the fact that we think 20% to 25% of these folks will ultimately end up on employer sponsored plans, 20% to 25% will ultimately end up in an individual ACA product, 40% to 45% will stay on Medicaid. And that's what we're tracking to and we actually have some insights into the states that are starting in June, it looks very promising that our thought process is going to be validated. So thank you for the question. Yeah. Thanks for the question, and good morning. In terms of our EPS, guidance, as you know, we raised it to $32.85 or greater than $32.85. And I think that would assume that a little bit more than 56% of our earnings will have occurred in the first half of the year. So when you look at the last six months of the year, we are actually pretty comfortable with what the current consensus estimates have associated with the third quarter and with the seasonality that the current consensus estimates have inherent in it. And that is that the third quarter will be a bit more profitable than the fourth quarter which is very consistent with the typical seasonality of our business. And then for \u201824, as you know, it's just really premature to go into a 2024 conversation at this time. We'll provide a lot more insights on that at the end of the year, a little bit more in the third quarter and a lot more at the end of the year and have a more robust conversation about 2024 at that time."

            "name": "Morgan Kendrick",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. Morgan here. I wanted to address -- I'd say that our expectations for membership growth are in line with what we projected and discussed at other instances. One of the things that's interesting though is we're wrapping up our national cycle. And so that's almost complete. One thing notably this year, it felt like the receipts were coming in slower or later and the actual decisions were made longer, which isn't terribly inconsistent with what we see during an economic shift if you think of things and where the affordability really matters. Our local market right now, we're just now getting into 4Q when we think about our business, and 3Q, 4Q and then [1,1] (ph), all of which look promising. We've gotten into some of the bigger lower market wins for next year and we're pleased with how the assets are resonating. And when go back and speak to national, we've had just an unbelievable run for the past several years. That's not different this year, but we've talked many times about each one of these cycles have nuances. There are three things that I think are important to note. Number one, this cycle for us when we think about our largest employers that will be in the end of the year into next year, there was a very, very large cohort of in force business. So this was a very strong retention year for our company that's been quite successful, which again reinforces how the assets are being resonating with some of the most discerning buyers in the country. Secondly, our win share continues at the rate that we've seen, albeit on a lower pipeline and smaller case count. But then lastly, I think the notable conclusion of the notable piece that we've shared in the past several years, we're continuing to see strong growth internally where employers are consolidating their benefit partners from one vendor -- from multiple vendors to one. So that's continuing with us. So all in, we feel good about our continued trajectory in the business. And as noted earlier our pricing activities continue with our forward view of trend. So we're quite optimistic at this point. Thank you again for the question."

I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health is off to a strong start to 2023 as we continue to execute on the strategy we discussed at our investor conference last month to become a lifetime trusted health partner for the consumers we are privileged to serve by focusing on whole health. At our March investor conference, we provided a road map for how we plan to continue to compound adjusted earnings per share by 12% to 15% through 2027 by optimizing our mature businesses, investing in high-growth opportunities and accelerating the growth of our organization through Carelon. First quarter results demonstrate progress on all fronts. GAAP earnings per share came in at $8.30. Adjusted earnings per share of $9.46 grew approximately 15% year-over-year, and we ended the quarter with 48.1 million medical members, growth of nearly 600,000 in the first quarter spread across Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Carelon's momentum also continued, with year-over-year revenue and operating gain up 18% and 21%, respectively. Given the strong start to the year and the momentum in both of our primary businesses, we raised our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $32.70 for 2023. Carelon Services continues to expand the scale and scope of services it provides to our own health plans and to external customers. The Carelon post-acute care management expansion with our health plans that we discussed at our investor conference is well underway and will contribute meaningfully to growth in 2023. We are now working to develop more seamless integration between transitions of care throughout all post-acute solutions, including home health and we'll be looking to extend the post-acute management solution beyond Medicare in the future. Carelon Behavioral Health recently extended its leadership position in crisis management, when it began serving as the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline managing entity to the New Jersey Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services at the beginning of this month. The scope of this work includes coordinating across all 988 centers in New Jersey, dispatching mobile crisis teams that provide emergency support and serving as the central integration partner for the unified technology platform. Beyond our work in support of 988, we are leveraging our expertise to improve health outcomes for members proactively. Our suicide prevention program uses a predictive analytics model to identify members at risk for suicidal event. And once those members are identified, we intervene through telephonic case management support crisis intervention or access to a peer support specialist. In a recent study, we observed a more than 20% reduction in adolescent and young adult suicidal events for commercial risk-based members engaged in the program relative to control groups, corresponding to a 30% reduction in per member per month behavioral health spending for engaged members post intervention. We have since expanded the program to cover even more of our members. CarelonRx remains focused on owning the strategic levers that create differentiation to advanced whole health. Since closing the acquisition of BioPlus in February, we have deepened our bench of specialty pharmacy talent and broken ground on the construction of the first of three new dispensing facilities. These investments will support the expansion of dispensing capacity ahead of the planned migration of CarelonRx's Specialty Prescription onto the BioPlus platform beginning in 2024. We have also added BioPlus as an in-network specialty pharmacy for all of our Medicaid and Commercial contracts. Later this year, we will be launching CarelonRx Pharmacy, a modern, differentiated home delivery experience that will be integrated into our Sydney Health app, improving quality, access and consumer experience while creating value for CarelonRx through additional dispensing margin. In our Health Benefits business, we're pleased to report progress on our key commitments. Commercial risk-based margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows, and we grew membership once again as the distinctive value we provide to the market continues to resonate. As you heard at our investor conference, our momentum reflects our steadfast focus on three things customers value across all segments; affordability, experience, and simplicity. Nearly all of our key experience metrics are at their highest point in years, including Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction, customer effort, and inquiry resolution. Meanwhile, retention rates across our national accounts business have tracked to historic highs in the past two selling seasons, yet another indication that our product innovation, digital investments, and overall value proposition are resonating. In alignment with our strategic focus on delivering exceptional consumer experiences, we continue to lead the market in advocacy. Our next-generation advocacy solution, total health connection entered the market this year, serving over 600,000 consumers building on the success of our total health, total new [ph] personalized engagement, and clinical advocacy solution, which continues to gain momentum. And in the first quarter, enjoyed a 12 percentage point improvement in its NPS score to 82%. Between these two innovative and integrated offerings, we now serve nearly 5 million advocacy members. We're also pleased with the performance of our individual business, which is poised for another year of strong growth through geographic expansion and strategic product positioning. We've grown membership 19% year-to-date compared with 5% growth for the market across our geographic footprint. We are well-positioned for additional growth when Medicaid beneficiaries begin to transition coverage later this year, whether members of our own Medicaid health plans or with coverage elsewhere. Medicaid membership growth continued in the first quarter as eligibility redeterminations remained on hold. In alignment with CMS requirements and state guidance on renewal processes, we have begun outreach to members to drive awareness about Medicaid redeterminations. We are taking an omnichannel approach to our work, supported by already set for new campaign, ground game educational activities, as well as our innovative digital decision support tool. Through this mobile-friendly web-based platform, we provide personalized guidance for consumers regarding their coverage options and eligibility for additional state and federal benefits based on answers to just a few quick questions. The support tool goes beyond traditional health care to include access to healthy food, child care and housing credits, alongside guidance on how to enroll. Most importantly, it will allow us to reach all effective consumers who are in need of assistance to maintain access to care, whether or not they are members of our health plans today. This approach positions Elevance Health distinctly in the market, and our deep local roots provides a strong understanding of the unique needs of our communities, alongside a diversified portfolio of solutions spanning Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare coverage we are uniquely well-positioned to ensure access to quality health care. Medicare posted strong growth in dual-eligible special needs plan and group members, which more than offset slower growth within individual Medicare Advantage. As we stated at our investor conference last month, Medicare Advantage is a strategically important market for Elevance Health over the long-term. And we were pleased to see CMS move to phase in the risk model revision it had proposed in the 2024 advance notice. This will provide time to help the industry adapt to the changes. Across all of our businesses, the transition to value-based care is a critical imperative, and we continue to make progress working closely with care providers in our network, including by integrating directly into their workflow processes through their own EMRs. Today, we are actively working with multiple leading EMR providers, including Epic, to establish bidirectional data exchanges with care providers that enable seamless prior authorization processes initiated directly within care providers EMR workflow. With this connectivity, our clinical staff can also review patient records and find the information they need to authorize care. In addition to accelerating care approval processes for consumers, this is resulting in substantially fewer requests for additional clinical information and significantly lower provider appeal rates. Recently, we published our first advancing health together progress report, which summarizes how we are promoting whole health by contracting for outcomes, collaborating for success and connecting for health. The report outlines our approach to make meaningful, measurable progress towards that goal by partnering closely with care providers to make whole health a reality, one person at a time. We encourage you to view the report, and we expect to provide annual updates on our progress towards achieving our 2027 target of having at least 80% of our consolidated benefit expense in value-based care with at least 40% in downside risk. While social factors like whole health and health equity will remain core to our business, we are also committed to strong governance and sustainability practices, especially those that drive better health outcomes and result in long-term value creation. We continue to receive strong recognition for our efforts and are proud to maintain sector-leading ratings from three of the most prominent ESG and corporate governance research, ratings and analytics firms. To learn more about how our social and environmental impact work supports our enterprise strategy, we encourage you to reference our recently released impact report for 2022. Now, I'd like to take a moment to thank our more than 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members who we are privileged to serve. Our commitment to improving lives and communities is unwavering, and it extends to our own associates. And we were pleased to be recognized for the third consecutive year as one of Fortune's 100 best companies to work for in 2023 and to be chosen by Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies. We will continue to prioritize culture and talent in pursuit of achieving our vision for Elevance Health. In conclusion, we are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year, as John will discuss in more detail in a moment, the balance and resilience of our enterprise will be key in 2023. We are confident in our ability to meet our commitments and remain focused on being a lifetime trusted health partner for those we are privileged to serve. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $8.30 and adjusted earnings per share of $9.46, representing growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. Our first quarter results reflect the continued execution of our enterprise strategy, as we continue to optimize our mature businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate the growth of our enterprise through Carelon, all in service of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. We ended the first quarter with medical membership of 48.1 million members, an increase of nearly 600,000 in the quarter and over 1.3 million year-over-year. Risk-based membership grew by approximately 1 million members year-over-year, driven by organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, dual-eligible special need plan and group members. In our commercial business, our individual membership grew by 124,000 lives or 15% year-over-year and by 19% year-to-date, driven by geographic expansion and strategic product positioning that should enable additional growth when coverage shifts related to medicaid redeterminations began later this year. Membership momentum in these areas was partially offset by attrition in our commercial group risk business, which we expected as a result of the pricing actions we took on January 1 renewals and to better reflect our post-pandemic cost structure and optimize the business for sustainable economics long term. Our fee-based business grew by approximately 370,000 lives year-over-year on top of a record selling season in the first quarter of last year, driven by strong retention rates and another solid national account selling season and with growth in BlueCard members. Overall, these results reflect balanced growth and strong momentum in our diverse health benefits business, and we believe that our well-balanced portfolio of offerings will serve us well when Medicaid beneficiaries begin to transition coverage in the coming quarters. As we discussed at our investor conference last month, growth in medical membership translates to growth for Carelon, which continues to grow both organically and inorganically through expanding the scale and scope of services it provides to our own and other health plans. Carelon's momentum continued in the first quarter, evident in its top line growth of nearly 18% and margin expansion that allowed operating gain to grow by nearly 21%. Now, before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, I'd like to spend a minute on our adoption of the new GAAP accounting requirements for how insurance companies account for long-term future policy benefit liabilities and deferred acquisition costs. For us, this new accounting requirement impacts our Medicare supplement plans. We adopted the new accounting guidelines for the long duration targeted improvements at the beginning of the year and embedded the new approach in our initial 2023 guidance. The change does not impact our previously reported cash flow. Our current cash position or our business strategy and will not materially impact future operating results. However, the new accounting pronouncement required us to restate prior year results. In the GAAP reconciliation table at the end of our press release, we have shown the isolated impact of the new accounting policies on our first quarter 2022 earnings, which we consider to be immaterial. First quarter operating revenue of $41.9 billion, increased approximately 11% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare, premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends and strong top line growth in CarelonRx and Carelon services. The medical loss ratio for the first quarter was 85.8%, an improvement of 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by premium rate adjustments in our Health Benefits business to more accurately reflect our post-pandemic cost structure. Our first quarter operating expense ratio came in at 11.5%, flat relative to the first quarter of 2022. Operating gain for the enterprise grew approximately 16% year-over-year in the first quarter as Carelon grew over 20%. And the Health Benefits delivered strong growth in the mid-teens percentage range on double-digit revenue growth and margin recovery of pandemic-era lows as we had expected. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40.5%, up from 39.9% at year-end 2022. The increase was due to debt raised during the quarter, a portion of which was used to fund our acquisition of BioPlus, which closed in February and refinanced a debt maturity. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $476.66 for approximately $622 million. Days and claims payable ended the first quarter at 46 days, a decrease of 1.5 days sequentially and 0.9 days year-over-year. Declines in DCPs were primarily driven by mix. With the Omicron COVID surge in the first quarter of 2022 and COVID claims generally having a longer cycle time than our overall average, DCPs were elevated a year ago. Medical Claims Payable also included nearly $400 million more of provider pass-through payments related to Medicaid in the first quarter of last year compared to the first quarter of this year. Excluding provider pass-through payments from both periods, our Medical Claims Payable would have grown by 10.1% year-over-year compared with 9.4% growth in premium revenue. As a reminder, we expect our Days in Claims Payable to be in the low 40% range long-term. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $6.5 billion, including the early receipt of a month of premium revenue from CMS. Excluding it, operating cash flow was $3.5 billion or 1.7 times net income. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the strong start to the year. Momentum in our Health Benefits and Carelon businesses bolsters our confidence in delivering another year of growth in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our long-term target compound annual growth rate of 12% to 15%. Given the strong start to the year, the balance and resilience of our enterprise and the momentum we have in each of our business segments, we have raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to greater than $32.70. As we look to the rest of 2023, our focus will remain on execution of our strategy and demonstrating that we have the best catchers met in the industry. We will continue to optimize our mature businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate the growth of our organization through Carelon. And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. I'll use my question on the DCP discussion, given it's a pretty important topic going on across the industry right now. So, John, you talked about seasonality impacts. You talked about type -- different types of claims driving a little bit lower DCP. And then you said low 40s is where we're going. Now, over time, I think everyone in -- every managed care investor looks at DCP and thinks of it as quality of earnings metric, right? When it's going up, it's good and down, it's bad, right? And typically, you just think that there's more or less reserving going on. I know there's a lot more to it. So, maybe you can tell us what's been driving your DCP lower recently beyond what you talked about already? And how are we going to get to the low 40s, meaning is it going to be for lower reserving, or is it going to be the kind of mechanical aspects? And over what time period should we expect that to kind of normalize? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Justin. And I do appreciate you you're taking your question or maybe I should say questions on DCP. But yes, our DCP is down by 1.5 days quarter-over-quarter and 0.9 days sequentially. And there's a lot of things that go into that calculation all the way from the number of days and the denominator can change on a quarter-over-quarter basis to various other aspects. I'll just state at the outset that our DCP will not get lower by reducing reserves. We have a very consistent and conservative methodology associated with our actuarial team. And in terms of coming up with reserves, those reserves are consistent here at March 31st as they were at December 31st and that there is no benefit to the income statement associated with this drop in DCP. So having that behind maybe talk a little bit about some of the mechanics that you asked about. We have a mix in the type of claims is obviously very important. And you look at a year ago, we were in the midst of the Omicron surge with COVID. COVID claims had a longer cycle time than other claims do. That had been the case through the entirety of the pandemic. And when you have a claim type that takes longer, both for the provider to bill us and for our adjudication process, the cycle time becomes longer, DCP just mathematically becomes a little bit inflated. And so with COVID being so much less in the first quarter of 2023 than it was in 2022 or 2021 for that matter, that cycle time is really very important, and so you see a drop. On reserves, and I made this comment in the prepared statements, but I think it's really important on the reserves, we have these retrospective provider pass-through payments that we get from our Medicaid partners, Medicaid states, And the amount of those reserves as of March of 2023 are $400 million less than they were at the end of March of 2022. And if we pulled out from the calculation from our reserves, these pass-through payments, which passed through by definition, have zero impact on net income. Then you would be able to see that our Medical Claims Payable balances have grown 10.1% year-over-year compared to a 9.4% growth in premium. Further, showing that our reserving methodologies are conservative, and our reserves are still very, very strong. So in terms of how long it's going to take to get to the low 40s, be another few years. And there's any number of constructs that could -- will occur. But we are starting to see payment cycles more consistent with pre-pandemic era payment cycles. And as those things are fully baked into the numbers, you should expect DCP to tweak down as a result. So thank you very much for the question and the opportunity to clarify all that.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. Thanks, John, and thanks, Justin. And I just want to reiterate what John said because I think it is a really important question. We feel we had a really strong start to this year and that, again, reiterating that DCP didn't impact earnings. And as you think about all the factors John talked about really is the mix and the longer tail of COVID claims and entering a more reasonable payment cycle. So thanks very much for the question, the opportunity to provide a little more perspective there. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi everybody. Thanks for the question. MLR was right in line with expectations on a consolidated basis, at least Street expectations, 30 basis points better year-to-year. Can you comment on any trends you're seeing underlying that with both respect to service categories, areas of care management that are plus or minuses and as you look at your MLR guidance for the full year, any changes in your thinking about the rest of the year there?\nJohn Gallina: No, thank you for the question, A.J. We're certainly very comfortable with our MLR guidance and really pleased to report a first quarter medical loss ratio of 85.8%. And maybe reiterating what I stated at Investor Day, the overall cost structure and the overall trends are very much aligned with our expectations, consistent with our pricing methodologies and consistent with our thought process. Now those trends are slightly elevated from what cost trends were pre-pandemic level. But as I said, they're exactly in line with our expectations and exactly aligned with our pricing methodology. So our MLR certainly has improved from the first quarter of 2022. And I think you can see that coming through in the Health Benefits segment margins. But we're pretty comfortable with where trend sits right now compared to our expectations. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please, go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yes. Could you talk a little bit about cross-sales in the quarter, in particular, I was interested in PBM cross sales and into your self-insured block? And then just in general, what your product strategy is with respect to self-insured as you're looking at your bundling in of some of your services businesses there? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Lance. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick first to talk a little bit about our fee-based business and then probably, Pete, to share what's happening in Carelon, because I think you hit on a really important point. One, the improvement of services that we're selling through to commercial, it's been a strategy for a number of years, and we've made some nice progress, as you've seen just in the percentage of premium going up and the profit per member. And then, obviously, Carelon is a big part of that, not just with the PBM, but Carelon Services. So, Morgan, please share.\nMorgan Kendrick: Lance, thanks for the question. When we think about the fee-based business, we've had a really, really strong run in the past several years. And I think that goes back and speaks to the health and the value that we're driving to the market, especially to the employers who are actually spending their own money. To your point, Carelon is a big, big piece of it. We had a really nice selling cycle this year, in fact, with the pharmacy business. We didn't see very many jumbos in the medical side. So thus, that was sort of absent from the actual Rx percentage as well for us. But nonetheless, we're seeing more and more attraction to this idea of the whole integrated delivery model of pharmacy medical together and the value that's delivering. Secondly, you think about the other products that are working with Carelon on, whether it's the behavioral health, whether these are sort of the incentive programs around payment integrity and bill review, things of that nature that are really important to our self-funded customers, that continues to see very strong growth and attraction from the market. That said, at the end of the day, Pete's team and my team are working together to build for purpose things that create value in the market. And again, I'll anchor back to the three things that Gail mentioned in the beginning in her opening remarks. The market is keenly focused on affordability, experience and simplicity. And the more that we can pull together, the better it's going to be for our markets. And I think the connection here between Carelon and the commercial fee-based business is strategically critical to that, continuing to drive growth. Pete, I'll turn it to you.\nPeter Haytaian: All right. Thanks, Morgan. And thanks for the question, Lance. I'll start with the pharmacy and then I'll go to the services side of things. But as Morgan said, the integrated offerings that we're selling is really resonating in the marketplace. I think our economics are perceived today as being very strong. And we continue to see momentum, and we talked about this in the 10,000 or below segment where Morgan and the business have a lot of strength on the commercial side of the business. We've seen RFP activity, quite frankly, be up in 2023 year-over-year. And another thing that I'll say is that I'm pleased with is retention is improving overall. So that's a really good thing. We're working closely with Morgan right now on the 2024 selling season that has begun. The pipe is building. I would say that we're very interested in niche opportunities, again, where our Commercial business has a lot of strength. So for example, on the labor side as well as with TPAs. So we see continued a lot of opportunity and sort of either niche opportunities or that 10,000 and below. As it relates to services, as Morgan said, we're really building off of where we started. And Gail mentioned in her prepared remarks, things like the post-acute care offering, that's a great example of where we started in Medicare, and we're really expanding that now into Commercial and expanding it not only with for post-acute care services but the things like durable medical equipment as well as social determinants of health. And then in our medical benefits management business, formerly known as AIM, we are in-sourcing a lot of critical services that we're deploying and cross-selling into Morgan's business, things like genetic testing, oncology. So there's a lot of areas that I think are very important to Morgan on the Commercial business that we're driving through over the next year. So I appreciate that question.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thank you for the question. I would just offer one additional proof point. We've shared this before, which is -- the customers who are single sourcing with us that we have many times shared multiple carriers, and we've done 23 of those over the last few years. And I think that's another good example of our ability not only consolidate medical but also to sell additional services, and it shows the value that we're bringing to the market. So again, just another quick proof point on ability to cross-sell. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Hey, thank you very much. Having had a little bit more time to work through the 2024 and a rate update and the RAD B rule, are there any incremental thoughts you can offer on the rate impact to Anthem's plans specifically and the extent to which the risk rebating and audit could impact physicians' willingness to take risk within the Carelon partnerships? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Ben. And I guess, first, I'll start and then ask Felicia Norwood to provide some perspective. First and foremost, we were pleased to see that CMS moved to phase in the risk model in the final notice. That will give us time all in the industry and with care providers to adjust. So as you know, we're in the midst of the 2024 bids. So we won't talk a lot about that, but I'll ask Felicia maybe to share a little bit more perspective on everything.\nFelicia Norwood: Yes. Good morning, Ben. And thank you for that question. As Gail said, we're certainly pleased with the phase-in of the risk model changes. This will give us the opportunity to smooth the impact to beneficiaries as well as the providers who serve them. Medicare Advantage for us strategically is a very important business long-term, and we will continue to be very focused on trying to make sure that we have a Whole Health approach and health equity around certainly individuals who participate in this program significantly who have low incomes and are certainly very much underrepresented. As I've said before, the individuals in this program over 40% have incomes less than $25,000. And when we take a look at our opportunity around drivers of health and supplemental benefits, it's important that we're able to balance all of these things as we take a look at our bids for 2024 as well as what we need to do with our provider partners long-term. With that said, we certainly don't believe that we are disproportionately disadvantaged by any of the changes here relative to our competitors. And as we think about our strategy for 2024, we will continue to be very focused on how we grow this very important business for us and equally important, how we continue to deliver value for those that we're privileged to serve.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Good morning and thank you. I really wanted to go back to your primary care strategy. Gail, when you made your initial comments around Carelon and Carelon Services, you didn't talk about that. I was just wondering if maybe you could give us an update on the relationship you have with Aledade or other areas that you're thinking about as you continue to build on value-based care and relationships with primary care doctors?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thank you for the question, Lisa. I think understanding our overall care provider strategy, it's really important that it's, first and foremost, critical to how we think about our health benefits business. And again, you said it at the beginning of the comments, it's about driving greater value-based care and importantly, increasing the amount of downside risk that we're going to share with providers. A couple of weeks ago, we shared with you, as you know, at the investor conference that our goal is to get to 80% of our consolidated health care reimbursement and value-based care by 27% and 40% downside. And again, we're sitting in the mid-60% right now and a little bit varied by business. But again, as you are thinking about our strategy, you mentioned Aledade and a few others, that's just one piece of it. It's important that we're trying to solve this for all lines of business and across multiple geographies. And so for us, we want it for Commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare. So, one size model isn't going to fit all for us. With respect to Carelon, what we're building and investing in our new enablement capabilities and those are going to allow us to accelerate the management and take more whole person risk from a variety of structures, quite frankly, not just through primary care. And again, I guess I would like to point out what's different about how we're thinking about scaling and leveraging what Carelon has and building across that continuum is that we really see a huge opportunity to enable and integrate specialty for the chronic and complex. That's an area you just heard Felicia talk about the dual population. It's a big population for us, specialized populations in Medicaid. And they're a huge part of benefit expense, and we think that's an area that has been under sourced quite frankly. So, as we think about it, yes, we are in partnerships. As you mentioned, some of those, they're important. They're helping us grow. But it's only one piece of our broader strategy, which, again, is to drive value-based care in our markets. And so we do see this as a big opportunity to drive both more consistency in our health benefits business, but also importantly drive operating gain and earnings inside of Carelon as we increase our capabilities. So, a little bit different than just primary care focused. I think much broader than that and how we're thinking about the overall strategy. Thanks very much for the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Thanks. Was interested maybe if you could drill in a little bit more on the post-acute care expansion in terms of where exactly things stand in terms of the scaling of that across the platform after the first quarter and then the timing on how you see that rolling out across the client base across Medicare and Commercial? And to the extent maybe just share some of the latest outcomes around that in terms of the key deliverables that you're driving for your clients on that? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Sure. Thanks, Scott, and I'll have Pete Haytaian address your questions. Thank you.\nPeter Haytaian: Thanks Scott. As we talked about, and Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really excited about this product offering. I talked about this at Investor Day, but we started on this journey a year, maybe 13, 14 months ago, we were able to fully implement this and finalize the implementation of this in the Medicare business in the first quarter. And that was with respect to the core post-acute care offering. And as we talked about, we are now expanding that with respect to durable medical equipment and social drivers of health. That will happen throughout this year. We are also expanding these services in terms of post-acute care into Medicare and Medicaid, and that will flow through this year and into next year. So there's a lot of runway still internally to drive these services. In terms of your question on key metrics and performance, that also is something that I'm very excited about. I mean, again, what we're trying to really do here is create a differentiated experience for post-acute care providers. So when they are in need of services or approval of services, they're dealing with technology in a portal that's differentiated, and it's a streamlined service so that they can get the approvals they need in the most appropriate fashion. And as we're looking at the different levels of post-acute care, we're seeing our performance play through and meet our original objectives. And that is that where appropriate, going to the appropriate levels of care and sites of care and then ultimately into the home, where cost and quality is most effective. And so we look across a series of metrics in that regard, and we're very pleased at the progress we're making. So in terms of the core product and the performance, very good; in terms of the expansion opportunity into other lines of business, that will happen over the next year into 2024.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nSteven Valiquette: Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody. So just a quick question here on your overall commercial membership. Aside from the impact from the repricing strategy that you've talked about for a while now on the risk book, I think it's also kind of noteworthy that US unemployment hasn't really increased so far in 2023. I guess when thinking about both the commercial risk and the fee-based push, just want to get your thoughts on the just seeming lack of negative macroeconomic impact on the commercial membership year-to-date at this stage? And whether that could create any upside bias on the overall commercial membership? I know redeterminations are a big factor at around this year, but just curious on the macro view from your perspective. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I'll ask Morgan to provide a little more color. But I guess I would say, if you look at the history of our business, we've had a pretty resilient book of business, both matched a little bit heavily \u2013 more heavily to government business, but we, quite frankly, diversified that and see nice growth in the individual, which you mentioned. From the employer perspective, I would just point to two things. One, we continue, as Morgan said, around those three areas of experience and value affordability to really drive, I think, a distinctive offering in the marketplace. So that served us well, certainly in the fee-based business, but also BlueCard. The Blue system overall, our BlueCard numbers are up, and that shows the distinctive value we add in our network across the entire system. So I think that's another -- in a recessionary whatever kind of environment that you might think about, we actually, I think, managed quite well because of distinctive value, and we're continuing to innovate our products. But I'll ask Morgan maybe to trade a little bit more color on how we see in the marketplace.\nMorgan Kendrick: Steven, one thing to camp on to Gail's comments there. When you think about our business, we're -- as she indicated, we're certainly not very indexed so to speak, in the hospitality industry, the tech industry. To Gail's point, it's more government business and you think about our downmarket business in particular. It's -- I don't like to use the word resilient, but it certainly is to a degree more so than others that have a different focus of the business. When you think about the recessionary times being negative, of course, it's interesting because the market tends to gravitate to certainty. And I think that's what we're seeing, when we're seeing employers consolidate benefit decisions into single vendor, when employers were having all-time high persistency rates, not only upmarket, but also down market, certainly experienced attrition in the risk-based business downmarket, which was purposeful as we written that book, but feel really good about the progress that we're making and feel really good about the way the assets are being seen and resonating in the market with our customers. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs.\nNathan Rich: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow up on A.J.'s question on utilization. Could you talk about how you expect cost trends to develop over the course of the year? And I guess, we've seen some data points on increases in procedure volumes. And at the Analyst Day, you had talked about cost pressure from the new GLP-1 drugs. I guess, are you comfortable that if we continue to see higher utilization in areas like these that it would be captured within your MLR guidance for the year?\nJohn Gallina: Yes. Thank you, Nathan. Appreciate the question, and I'll start with the end of your question first. We are very confident that the utilization trends that we are seeing are captured on our MLR guidance for the year. So that is not an issue at all as we sit here today. In terms of some of the cost pressures, they said there are cost pressures and there are a lot of areas that are doing better than we had had anticipated. On the GLP-1, that's been talked about quite a bit. We've got a lot of protocols in there. I do want to make sure people are clear that GLP-1 is both weight loss and diabetes. And for weight loss, we do not cover weight loss drugs, with the exception of a few states where it's required by state law. So that's not really has ever been part of the conversation and was never part of any of the commentary. I just want to make sure everybody was clear on that. And then in terms of the diabetes drugs, certainly, we want to making sure that people who have diabetes that need access to those drugs are getting access to them, but to have the appropriate protocol, so that they're not utilized for purposes that are other than medical necessity for diabetes-type folks. And on the other side of the equation, we're still seeing very good trends, maybe in terms of ER is still below pandemic era or pre-pandemic era levels. We've got -- COVID is actually a bit less than we had estimated at this point in time. We had a more mild flu season. The timing of when we pay for the vaccine serum in terms of the boosters has now been pushed out later in the year. There are many, many, many estimates that go into trend. Overall, we are very comfortable with where we sit today. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please, go ahead.\nDave Windley: All right. Thank you for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to go to redetermination with that -- upon us. You talked about working with the states very closely for several quarters now. At the Investor Day, we were involved in some discussions where there was a little bit more detail offered around states prospectively estimating changes in the risk pool from redetermination and factoring that into rates. And so that seems a little bit more supportive, I guess, of margin prospectively and something we would be -- need to be less concerned about as this evolves and the risk pool changes. I wondered if you could add some color to that and perhaps talk about what the composite rate looks like, how much higher it is than normal as a result of that type of activity? Thanks.\nJohn Gallina: Thank you, Dave. I'll start out with just addressing the acuity factor is what you were describing, which is now part of a standardized Medicaid rate renewal process associated with what the belief is the acuity of the population will be those covered, which is different than what existed in 2019. And so we feel very good about that. The acuity shifts are now a standard input into the actuarial rating models. And as I said, that was not the case in 2019. We -- this has started here already in 2023 in January. We work very closely with our state partners to ensure that we have actuarially justified rates. And since the acuity factors part of that actuarial assessment, we feel very, very good about it. In terms of the exact percentage, that's not something that we're going to talk about here publicly. Each state is different. Each state has its actuaries. We have our actuaries. We have had very, very good success at having the meeting of the minds with the vast majority of our states in terms of actuarially equivalent rates. So we feel very good about it. But nothing really has changed in terms of our ability to hit our numbers for the rest of the year and where we think are really our great catchers met that we have positions us well for Medicaid redeterminations regardless where the members end up going to seek health insurance coverage.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, John. And maybe I'll ask Felicia just to give a little bit of perspective on what's happening with redeterminations because the process has started, but it's fairly early in the process. So Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: Yes. Thank you, Gail. And Dave, thank you for the question. as we talked at Investor Day, we've been hard at work at this for some period of time with our state partners, all with the goal of trying to make sure that those individuals who have had access to health care coverage continue to maintain that assess, whether or not that's on the Medicaid side or certainly on the Commercial side and an exchange product. So as we think about where we are today, our teams are engaged in almost weekly meetings with our state partners. We have been advancing a lot of thought leadership around outreach and contact with members, being able to shore up administrative processes around addresses, making sure we're able to reach out to members wherever they are and also being able to have processes that help to provide a seamless transition where possible between our Medicaid business and then what happens on the Commercial side. We're very fortunate of the collaboration we've had here with Morgan and his team, and I think that positions us well for how we capture members as they move from Medicaid over to a Commercial product. Gail mentioned earlier, our Ready, Set renew campaign, the mobile initiatives that we've developed, all trying to meet members wherever they are. in this process and then have the ability with our state partners to be able to align around the kinds of ways that we can outreach to Medicaid members in ways that we haven't done before. So we feel fully prepared. We are pleased to see the engagement of beneficiaries as they are reaching out to understand what this process means for them ultimately with the goal of trying to make sure that we continue coverage for as many of those individuals as we possibly can. At the end of the day, we have strong collaboration with our states at this point. Great visibility in terms of how we are positioned around trying to maintain actuarially sound rates through this process and being able to work closely as we move through redeterminations, albeit early, but very vigilantly and diligent with our state partners as we move through this over the next 12 to 14 months.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Felicia. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Really appreciated the answer on the DCPs. And I guess just in the commentary that trend is normal and you're not really seeing anything extraordinary there. I guess my question is why are MLRs not really beating anymore. We're hearing trend is normal. We understand Days in Claims Payable and why they're coming down. It just feels like the risk to MLR right now is greater. Is there -- is it a pricing issue? Is it a mix issue? Is it just that this is the new normal, and we're sort of back to where trend and pricing are much more similar and maybe we just got spoiled through the years of COVID?\nJohn Gallina: Thank you for that question, Kevin. And I guess the first thing I really do have to say is we feel very good about where MLR came in and where trend came in, and it actually was a bit better than our expectations. So, when I look at what we have been projecting as of the beginning of the year, our 86.8% is actually positive to those expectations. In terms of pricing, our goal is always to price to cover forward trend and then to guide that way. We had said that for Commercial that there were some underlying cost structures associated with COVID that we needed to ensure that our pricing reflected not only forward trend, but also that so that our total pricing reflected the overall cost structure. I think we've done a very, very good job now here at the end of the first quarter of really trying to get -- hit that sweet spot of pricing to really retain a nice large cohort of our membership as well as to see the margin expansion. So, we actually feel very, very good about where the results are and do believe that we're a bit better than we had anticipated even 90 days ago.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Wanted to ask about the exchange presence. Obviously, you're growing that well, expanding into markets. The market always loves growth, but then there becomes a time when growth could be too much growth. So, I wanted to get a little more color on kind of how membership or equality data you have around what that performance looks like so far? And then how you're thinking about the risk profile of the redetermination population back on to the exchanges? Is that something that you think would have a normal margin, a higher margin, or lower margin than the exchange business overall? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll start and then ask Morgan to share his perspective. I think one of the things about our presence in the exchange marketplace is that we've been very consistent around sort of where we started. We've always been in that business. Quite frankly, we've never lost money in that business. So, we've been very careful about the expansion, and we've done it, I would say, on a very paced way. So, over the last several years, we've added counties as we've understood them, re-contracted, make sure the network was specifically curated. I think we've done a nice job of understanding the risk adjustment mechanisms and all of those things. So, in total, as we -- this year added more counties, that was a very paced and understood expansion. So, we feel very good about it, quite frankly. We feel very good about the performance profile of the members in there because we have a really good handle on who they are and kind of what our expectations are. And as they come in from Medicaid, obviously, we know the Medicaid profile as well because we're big in those states, too. So I guess my answer would be, look, we aren't someone who just came into the exchanges and one big fell swoop and wanted to make a big hit one year. We've had a very paced and measured progression of both our growth as well as our expansion, so feel very good about that. But maybe Morgan, if you want to add a couple of more comments about that.\nMorgan Kendrick: Kevin, thanks for the question, and Gail. I don't know there's a whole lot to add back to the comment around pace and sustainability of the business, Kevin. We took this very measured approach, certainly, looking at Medicaid redeterminations, we wanted to make sure we were expanding into the areas where we could serve as many members as we could in our 14 geographies. That said, the interesting thing about this cycle, we had a lot of ins and outs in the market with competitors that had come in and then left. So it left a lot of movement in the market that perhaps ordinarily wouldn't have occurred. So back to Gail's comments, we feel good about where we're positioned. We feel good about the economics behind it and are positioned well for when redetermination begins.\nKevin Fischbeck: Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you for the question. One last question.\nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Yeah, hi. Thanks. I was hoping to get a quick update on how the government business performed in the first quarter. I think you previously had talked about Medicare Advantage as being a margin tailwind year-over-year for 2023, but I didn't necessarily see that in the release or the prepared remarks as a driver on the MLR line. So I just want to understand that a little bit better. Thank you.\nJohn Gallina: Yeah. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. And as you think about the -- some of the tailwinds that we have in 2023, it certainly includes the repricing of commercial to better reflect the overall cost structure. We're still doing fine in Medicaid. And then as you pointed out, the Medicare Advantage we now have a higher percent star revenue than we did the year before, and our risk-adjusted scores are getting back to more normalized levels. So it definitely is one of the tailwinds that we are -- that we do have for 2023. So the fact that it wasn't in the prepared comments, don't read anything into that specifically other than to say that it's really -- it's a very good be a growing line of business for us over the next several years, and we feel very, very good about how well-positioned we are. And then with the three-year phase-in of the rate notice, I think we can certainly manage through that as well. So Medicare Advantage continues to be a very important line of business for us. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. And thanks for the question. Thanks, John. And overall, I guess, reiterate we do feel the government business performed better than expectations. So we feel very good about to be specific to your question.\nGail Boudreaux: Now I'd like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased to have delivered a strong start to 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue delivering against the financial targets that we shared with you at our investor conference last month. Through a steadfast focus on whole health and our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we will continue to meet the needs of consumers, customers and the communities that we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. We'll keep executing with focus and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through May 19, 2023.

            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Morgan. And thanks for the question, Lance. I'll start with the pharmacy and then I'll go to the services side of things. But as Morgan said, the integrated offerings that we're selling is really resonating in the marketplace. I think our economics are perceived today as being very strong. And we continue to see momentum, and we talked about this in the 10,000 or below segment where Morgan and the business have a lot of strength on the commercial side of the business. We've seen RFP activity, quite frankly, be up in 2023 year-over-year. And another thing that I'll say is that I'm pleased with is retention is improving overall. So that's a really good thing. We're working closely with Morgan right now on the 2024 selling season that has begun. The pipe is building. I would say that we're very interested in niche opportunities, again, where our Commercial business has a lot of strength. So for example, on the labor side as well as with TPAs. So we see continued a lot of opportunity and sort of either niche opportunities or that 10,000 and below. As it relates to services, as Morgan said, we're really building off of where we started. And Gail mentioned in her prepared remarks, things like the post-acute care offering, that's a great example of where we started in Medicare, and we're really expanding that now into Commercial and expanding it not only with for post-acute care services but the things like durable medical equipment as well as social determinants of health. And then in our medical benefits management business, formerly known as AIM, we are in-sourcing a lot of critical services that we're deploying and cross-selling into Morgan's business, things like genetic testing, oncology. So there's a lot of areas that I think are very important to Morgan on the Commercial business that we're driving through over the next year. So I appreciate that question. Thanks Scott. As we talked about, and Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really excited about this product offering. I talked about this at Investor Day, but we started on this journey a year, maybe 13, 14 months ago, we were able to fully implement this and finalize the implementation of this in the Medicare business in the first quarter. And that was with respect to the core post-acute care offering. And as we talked about, we are now expanding that with respect to durable medical equipment and social drivers of health. That will happen throughout this year. We are also expanding these services in terms of post-acute care into Medicare and Medicaid, and that will flow through this year and into next year. So there's a lot of runway still internally to drive these services. In terms of your question on key metrics and performance, that also is something that I'm very excited about. I mean, again, what we're trying to really do here is create a differentiated experience for post-acute care providers. So when they are in need of services or approval of services, they're dealing with technology in a portal that's differentiated, and it's a streamlined service so that they can get the approvals they need in the most appropriate fashion. And as we're looking at the different levels of post-acute care, we're seeing our performance play through and meet our original objectives. And that is that where appropriate, going to the appropriate levels of care and sites of care and then ultimately into the home, where cost and quality is most effective. And so we look across a series of metrics in that regard, and we're very pleased at the progress we're making. So in terms of the core product and the performance, very good; in terms of the expansion opportunity into other lines of business, that will happen over the next year into 2024."

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we're pleased to share that Elevance Health is off to a strong start to 2023 as we continue to execute on the strategy we discussed at our investor conference last month to become a lifetime trusted health partner for the consumers we are privileged to serve by focusing on whole health. At our March investor conference, we provided a road map for how we plan to continue to compound adjusted earnings per share by 12% to 15% through 2027 by optimizing our mature businesses, investing in high-growth opportunities and accelerating the growth of our organization through Carelon. First quarter results demonstrate progress on all fronts. GAAP earnings per share came in at $8.30. Adjusted earnings per share of $9.46 grew approximately 15% year-over-year, and we ended the quarter with 48.1 million medical members, growth of nearly 600,000 in the first quarter spread across Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. Carelon's momentum also continued, with year-over-year revenue and operating gain up 18% and 21%, respectively. Given the strong start to the year and the momentum in both of our primary businesses, we raised our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be greater than $32.70 for 2023. Carelon Services continues to expand the scale and scope of services it provides to our own health plans and to external customers. The Carelon post-acute care management expansion with our health plans that we discussed at our investor conference is well underway and will contribute meaningfully to growth in 2023. We are now working to develop more seamless integration between transitions of care throughout all post-acute solutions, including home health and we'll be looking to extend the post-acute management solution beyond Medicare in the future. Carelon Behavioral Health recently extended its leadership position in crisis management, when it began serving as the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline managing entity to the New Jersey Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services at the beginning of this month. The scope of this work includes coordinating across all 988 centers in New Jersey, dispatching mobile crisis teams that provide emergency support and serving as the central integration partner for the unified technology platform. Beyond our work in support of 988, we are leveraging our expertise to improve health outcomes for members proactively. Our suicide prevention program uses a predictive analytics model to identify members at risk for suicidal event. And once those members are identified, we intervene through telephonic case management support crisis intervention or access to a peer support specialist. In a recent study, we observed a more than 20% reduction in adolescent and young adult suicidal events for commercial risk-based members engaged in the program relative to control groups, corresponding to a 30% reduction in per member per month behavioral health spending for engaged members post intervention. We have since expanded the program to cover even more of our members. CarelonRx remains focused on owning the strategic levers that create differentiation to advanced whole health. Since closing the acquisition of BioPlus in February, we have deepened our bench of specialty pharmacy talent and broken ground on the construction of the first of three new dispensing facilities. These investments will support the expansion of dispensing capacity ahead of the planned migration of CarelonRx's Specialty Prescription onto the BioPlus platform beginning in 2024. We have also added BioPlus as an in-network specialty pharmacy for all of our Medicaid and Commercial contracts. Later this year, we will be launching CarelonRx Pharmacy, a modern, differentiated home delivery experience that will be integrated into our Sydney Health app, improving quality, access and consumer experience while creating value for CarelonRx through additional dispensing margin. In our Health Benefits business, we're pleased to report progress on our key commitments. Commercial risk-based margins continue to recover from pandemic-era lows, and we grew membership once again as the distinctive value we provide to the market continues to resonate. As you heard at our investor conference, our momentum reflects our steadfast focus on three things customers value across all segments; affordability, experience, and simplicity. Nearly all of our key experience metrics are at their highest point in years, including Net Promoter Score, customer satisfaction, customer effort, and inquiry resolution. Meanwhile, retention rates across our national accounts business have tracked to historic highs in the past two selling seasons, yet another indication that our product innovation, digital investments, and overall value proposition are resonating. In alignment with our strategic focus on delivering exceptional consumer experiences, we continue to lead the market in advocacy. Our next-generation advocacy solution, total health connection entered the market this year, serving over 600,000 consumers building on the success of our total health, total new [ph] personalized engagement, and clinical advocacy solution, which continues to gain momentum. And in the first quarter, enjoyed a 12 percentage point improvement in its NPS score to 82%. Between these two innovative and integrated offerings, we now serve nearly 5 million advocacy members. We're also pleased with the performance of our individual business, which is poised for another year of strong growth through geographic expansion and strategic product positioning. We've grown membership 19% year-to-date compared with 5% growth for the market across our geographic footprint. We are well-positioned for additional growth when Medicaid beneficiaries begin to transition coverage later this year, whether members of our own Medicaid health plans or with coverage elsewhere. Medicaid membership growth continued in the first quarter as eligibility redeterminations remained on hold. In alignment with CMS requirements and state guidance on renewal processes, we have begun outreach to members to drive awareness about Medicaid redeterminations. We are taking an omnichannel approach to our work, supported by already set for new campaign, ground game educational activities, as well as our innovative digital decision support tool. Through this mobile-friendly web-based platform, we provide personalized guidance for consumers regarding their coverage options and eligibility for additional state and federal benefits based on answers to just a few quick questions. The support tool goes beyond traditional health care to include access to healthy food, child care and housing credits, alongside guidance on how to enroll. Most importantly, it will allow us to reach all effective consumers who are in need of assistance to maintain access to care, whether or not they are members of our health plans today. This approach positions Elevance Health distinctly in the market, and our deep local roots provides a strong understanding of the unique needs of our communities, alongside a diversified portfolio of solutions spanning Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare coverage we are uniquely well-positioned to ensure access to quality health care. Medicare posted strong growth in dual-eligible special needs plan and group members, which more than offset slower growth within individual Medicare Advantage. As we stated at our investor conference last month, Medicare Advantage is a strategically important market for Elevance Health over the long-term. And we were pleased to see CMS move to phase in the risk model revision it had proposed in the 2024 advance notice. This will provide time to help the industry adapt to the changes. Across all of our businesses, the transition to value-based care is a critical imperative, and we continue to make progress working closely with care providers in our network, including by integrating directly into their workflow processes through their own EMRs. Today, we are actively working with multiple leading EMR providers, including Epic, to establish bidirectional data exchanges with care providers that enable seamless prior authorization processes initiated directly within care providers EMR workflow. With this connectivity, our clinical staff can also review patient records and find the information they need to authorize care. In addition to accelerating care approval processes for consumers, this is resulting in substantially fewer requests for additional clinical information and significantly lower provider appeal rates. Recently, we published our first advancing health together progress report, which summarizes how we are promoting whole health by contracting for outcomes, collaborating for success and connecting for health. The report outlines our approach to make meaningful, measurable progress towards that goal by partnering closely with care providers to make whole health a reality, one person at a time. We encourage you to view the report, and we expect to provide annual updates on our progress towards achieving our 2027 target of having at least 80% of our consolidated benefit expense in value-based care with at least 40% in downside risk. While social factors like whole health and health equity will remain core to our business, we are also committed to strong governance and sustainability practices, especially those that drive better health outcomes and result in long-term value creation. We continue to receive strong recognition for our efforts and are proud to maintain sector-leading ratings from three of the most prominent ESG and corporate governance research, ratings and analytics firms. To learn more about how our social and environmental impact work supports our enterprise strategy, we encourage you to reference our recently released impact report for 2022. Now, I'd like to take a moment to thank our more than 100,000 associates for the important work they do every day on behalf of the members who we are privileged to serve. Our commitment to improving lives and communities is unwavering, and it extends to our own associates. And we were pleased to be recognized for the third consecutive year as one of Fortune's 100 best companies to work for in 2023 and to be chosen by Fortune as one of America's most innovative companies. We will continue to prioritize culture and talent in pursuit of achieving our vision for Elevance Health. In conclusion, we are pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year, as John will discuss in more detail in a moment, the balance and resilience of our enterprise will be key in 2023. We are confident in our ability to meet our commitments and remain focused on being a lifetime trusted health partner for those we are privileged to serve. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John for more on our operating results. John? Yeah. Thanks, John, and thanks, Justin. And I just want to reiterate what John said because I think it is a really important question. We feel we had a really strong start to this year and that, again, reiterating that DCP didn't impact earnings. And as you think about all the factors John talked about really is the mix and the longer tail of COVID claims and entering a more reasonable payment cycle. So thanks very much for the question, the opportunity to provide a little more perspective there. Next question please. Thank you. Next question, please. Yes. Thanks for the question, Lance. I'm going to ask Morgan Kendrick first to talk a little bit about our fee-based business and then probably, Pete, to share what's happening in Carelon, because I think you hit on a really important point. One, the improvement of services that we're selling through to commercial, it's been a strategy for a number of years, and we've made some nice progress, as you've seen just in the percentage of premium going up and the profit per member. And then, obviously, Carelon is a big part of that, not just with the PBM, but Carelon Services. So, Morgan, please share. Yes. Thank you for the question. I would just offer one additional proof point. We've shared this before, which is -- the customers who are single sourcing with us that we have many times shared multiple carriers, and we've done 23 of those over the last few years. And I think that's another good example of our ability not only consolidate medical but also to sell additional services, and it shows the value that we're bringing to the market. So again, just another quick proof point on ability to cross-sell. Next question, please. Thanks for the question, Ben. And I guess, first, I'll start and then ask Felicia Norwood to provide some perspective. First and foremost, we were pleased to see that CMS moved to phase in the risk model in the final notice. That will give us time all in the industry and with care providers to adjust. So as you know, we're in the midst of the 2024 bids. So we won't talk a lot about that, but I'll ask Felicia maybe to share a little bit more perspective on everything. Thank you. Next question please. Yes. Thank you for the question, Lisa. I think understanding our overall care provider strategy, it's really important that it's, first and foremost, critical to how we think about our health benefits business. And again, you said it at the beginning of the comments, it's about driving greater value-based care and importantly, increasing the amount of downside risk that we're going to share with providers. A couple of weeks ago, we shared with you, as you know, at the investor conference that our goal is to get to 80% of our consolidated health care reimbursement and value-based care by 27% and 40% downside. And again, we're sitting in the mid-60% right now and a little bit varied by business. But again, as you are thinking about our strategy, you mentioned Aledade and a few others, that's just one piece of it. It's important that we're trying to solve this for all lines of business and across multiple geographies. And so for us, we want it for Commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare. So, one size model isn't going to fit all for us. With respect to Carelon, what we're building and investing in our new enablement capabilities and those are going to allow us to accelerate the management and take more whole person risk from a variety of structures, quite frankly, not just through primary care. And again, I guess I would like to point out what's different about how we're thinking about scaling and leveraging what Carelon has and building across that continuum is that we really see a huge opportunity to enable and integrate specialty for the chronic and complex. That's an area you just heard Felicia talk about the dual population. It's a big population for us, specialized populations in Medicaid. And they're a huge part of benefit expense, and we think that's an area that has been under sourced quite frankly. So, as we think about it, yes, we are in partnerships. As you mentioned, some of those, they're important. They're helping us grow. But it's only one piece of our broader strategy, which, again, is to drive value-based care in our markets. And so we do see this as a big opportunity to drive both more consistency in our health benefits business, but also importantly drive operating gain and earnings inside of Carelon as we increase our capabilities. So, a little bit different than just primary care focused. I think much broader than that and how we're thinking about the overall strategy. Thanks very much for the question. Next question please. Sure. Thanks, Scott, and I'll have Pete Haytaian address your questions. Thank you. Thank you. Next question, please. Yeah. Thanks for the question, Steve. I'll ask Morgan to provide a little more color. But I guess I would say, if you look at the history of our business, we've had a pretty resilient book of business, both matched a little bit heavily \u2013 more heavily to government business, but we, quite frankly, diversified that and see nice growth in the individual, which you mentioned. From the employer perspective, I would just point to two things. One, we continue, as Morgan said, around those three areas of experience and value affordability to really drive, I think, a distinctive offering in the marketplace. So that served us well, certainly in the fee-based business, but also BlueCard. The Blue system overall, our BlueCard numbers are up, and that shows the distinctive value we add in our network across the entire system. So I think that's another -- in a recessionary whatever kind of environment that you might think about, we actually, I think, managed quite well because of distinctive value, and we're continuing to innovate our products. But I'll ask Morgan maybe to trade a little bit more color on how we see in the marketplace. Thank you. Next question, please. Next question, please. Thanks, John. And maybe I'll ask Felicia just to give a little bit of perspective on what's happening with redeterminations because the process has started, but it's fairly early in the process. So Felicia? Thank you, Felicia. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question please. Yes. Thanks for the question, Kevin. I'll start and then ask Morgan to share his perspective. I think one of the things about our presence in the exchange marketplace is that we've been very consistent around sort of where we started. We've always been in that business. Quite frankly, we've never lost money in that business. So, we've been very careful about the expansion, and we've done it, I would say, on a very paced way. So, over the last several years, we've added counties as we've understood them, re-contracted, make sure the network was specifically curated. I think we've done a nice job of understanding the risk adjustment mechanisms and all of those things. So, in total, as we -- this year added more counties, that was a very paced and understood expansion. So, we feel very good about it, quite frankly. We feel very good about the performance profile of the members in there because we have a really good handle on who they are and kind of what our expectations are. And as they come in from Medicaid, obviously, we know the Medicaid profile as well because we're big in those states, too. So I guess my answer would be, look, we aren't someone who just came into the exchanges and one big fell swoop and wanted to make a big hit one year. We've had a very paced and measured progression of both our growth as well as our expansion, so feel very good about that. But maybe Morgan, if you want to add a couple of more comments about that. Thank you for the question. One last question. Yeah. And thanks for the question. Thanks, John. And overall, I guess, reiterate we do feel the government business performed better than expectations. So we feel very good about to be specific to your question. Now I'd like to close by saying thank you. We're pleased to have delivered a strong start to 2023, and we're confident that the ongoing execution of our strategy positions us to continue delivering against the financial targets that we shared with you at our investor conference last month. Through a steadfast focus on whole health and our diverse and expanding suite of products and solutions, we will continue to meet the needs of consumers, customers and the communities that we serve, advancing our strategy of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. We'll keep executing with focus and discipline to bring increasing value to all of our stakeholders. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of the week."

            "content": "Yes. Good morning, Ben. And thank you for that question. As Gail said, we're certainly pleased with the phase-in of the risk model changes. This will give us the opportunity to smooth the impact to beneficiaries as well as the providers who serve them. Medicare Advantage for us strategically is a very important business long-term, and we will continue to be very focused on trying to make sure that we have a Whole Health approach and health equity around certainly individuals who participate in this program significantly who have low incomes and are certainly very much underrepresented. As I've said before, the individuals in this program over 40% have incomes less than $25,000. And when we take a look at our opportunity around drivers of health and supplemental benefits, it's important that we're able to balance all of these things as we take a look at our bids for 2024 as well as what we need to do with our provider partners long-term. With that said, we certainly don't believe that we are disproportionately disadvantaged by any of the changes here relative to our competitors. And as we think about our strategy for 2024, we will continue to be very focused on how we grow this very important business for us and equally important, how we continue to deliver value for those that we're privileged to serve. Yes. Thank you, Gail. And Dave, thank you for the question. as we talked at Investor Day, we've been hard at work at this for some period of time with our state partners, all with the goal of trying to make sure that those individuals who have had access to health care coverage continue to maintain that assess, whether or not that's on the Medicaid side or certainly on the Commercial side and an exchange product. So as we think about where we are today, our teams are engaged in almost weekly meetings with our state partners. We have been advancing a lot of thought leadership around outreach and contact with members, being able to shore up administrative processes around addresses, making sure we're able to reach out to members wherever they are and also being able to have processes that help to provide a seamless transition where possible between our Medicaid business and then what happens on the Commercial side. We're very fortunate of the collaboration we've had here with Morgan and his team, and I think that positions us well for how we capture members as they move from Medicaid over to a Commercial product. Gail mentioned earlier, our Ready, Set renew campaign, the mobile initiatives that we've developed, all trying to meet members wherever they are. in this process and then have the ability with our state partners to be able to align around the kinds of ways that we can outreach to Medicaid members in ways that we haven't done before. So we feel fully prepared. We are pleased to see the engagement of beneficiaries as they are reaching out to understand what this process means for them ultimately with the goal of trying to make sure that we continue coverage for as many of those individuals as we possibly can. At the end of the day, we have strong collaboration with our states at this point. Great visibility in terms of how we are positioned around trying to maintain actuarially sound rates through this process and being able to work closely as we move through redeterminations, albeit early, but very vigilantly and diligent with our state partners as we move through this over the next 12 to 14 months."

            "name": "John Gallina",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported strong first quarter results, including GAAP earnings per share of $8.30 and adjusted earnings per share of $9.46, representing growth of approximately 15% year-over-year. Our first quarter results reflect the continued execution of our enterprise strategy, as we continue to optimize our mature businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate the growth of our enterprise through Carelon, all in service of becoming a lifetime trusted health partner. We ended the first quarter with medical membership of 48.1 million members, an increase of nearly 600,000 in the quarter and over 1.3 million year-over-year. Risk-based membership grew by approximately 1 million members year-over-year, driven by organic growth in Medicaid and Medicare Advantage, dual-eligible special need plan and group members. In our commercial business, our individual membership grew by 124,000 lives or 15% year-over-year and by 19% year-to-date, driven by geographic expansion and strategic product positioning that should enable additional growth when coverage shifts related to medicaid redeterminations began later this year. Membership momentum in these areas was partially offset by attrition in our commercial group risk business, which we expected as a result of the pricing actions we took on January 1 renewals and to better reflect our post-pandemic cost structure and optimize the business for sustainable economics long term. Our fee-based business grew by approximately 370,000 lives year-over-year on top of a record selling season in the first quarter of last year, driven by strong retention rates and another solid national account selling season and with growth in BlueCard members. Overall, these results reflect balanced growth and strong momentum in our diverse health benefits business, and we believe that our well-balanced portfolio of offerings will serve us well when Medicaid beneficiaries begin to transition coverage in the coming quarters. As we discussed at our investor conference last month, growth in medical membership translates to growth for Carelon, which continues to grow both organically and inorganically through expanding the scale and scope of services it provides to our own and other health plans. Carelon's momentum continued in the first quarter, evident in its top line growth of nearly 18% and margin expansion that allowed operating gain to grow by nearly 21%. Now, before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, I'd like to spend a minute on our adoption of the new GAAP accounting requirements for how insurance companies account for long-term future policy benefit liabilities and deferred acquisition costs. For us, this new accounting requirement impacts our Medicare supplement plans. We adopted the new accounting guidelines for the long duration targeted improvements at the beginning of the year and embedded the new approach in our initial 2023 guidance. The change does not impact our previously reported cash flow. Our current cash position or our business strategy and will not materially impact future operating results. However, the new accounting pronouncement required us to restate prior year results. In the GAAP reconciliation table at the end of our press release, we have shown the isolated impact of the new accounting policies on our first quarter 2022 earnings, which we consider to be immaterial. First quarter operating revenue of $41.9 billion, increased approximately 11% year-over-year. Growth was driven by higher premium revenue in Medicaid and Medicare, premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends and strong top line growth in CarelonRx and Carelon services. The medical loss ratio for the first quarter was 85.8%, an improvement of 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by premium rate adjustments in our Health Benefits business to more accurately reflect our post-pandemic cost structure. Our first quarter operating expense ratio came in at 11.5%, flat relative to the first quarter of 2022. Operating gain for the enterprise grew approximately 16% year-over-year in the first quarter as Carelon grew over 20%. And the Health Benefits delivered strong growth in the mid-teens percentage range on double-digit revenue growth and margin recovery of pandemic-era lows as we had expected. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 40.5%, up from 39.9% at year-end 2022. The increase was due to debt raised during the quarter, a portion of which was used to fund our acquisition of BioPlus, which closed in February and refinanced a debt maturity. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $476.66 for approximately $622 million. Days and claims payable ended the first quarter at 46 days, a decrease of 1.5 days sequentially and 0.9 days year-over-year. Declines in DCPs were primarily driven by mix. With the Omicron COVID surge in the first quarter of 2022 and COVID claims generally having a longer cycle time than our overall average, DCPs were elevated a year ago. Medical Claims Payable also included nearly $400 million more of provider pass-through payments related to Medicaid in the first quarter of last year compared to the first quarter of this year. Excluding provider pass-through payments from both periods, our Medical Claims Payable would have grown by 10.1% year-over-year compared with 9.4% growth in premium revenue. As a reminder, we expect our Days in Claims Payable to be in the low 40% range long-term. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $6.5 billion, including the early receipt of a month of premium revenue from CMS. Excluding it, operating cash flow was $3.5 billion or 1.7 times net income. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the strong start to the year. Momentum in our Health Benefits and Carelon businesses bolsters our confidence in delivering another year of growth in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our long-term target compound annual growth rate of 12% to 15%. Given the strong start to the year, the balance and resilience of our enterprise and the momentum we have in each of our business segments, we have raised our full year outlook for adjusted earnings per share to greater than $32.70. As we look to the rest of 2023, our focus will remain on execution of our strategy and demonstrating that we have the best catchers met in the industry. We will continue to optimize our mature businesses, invest in high-growth opportunities and accelerate the growth of our organization through Carelon. And with that, operator, please open up the call to questions. Thank you, Justin. And I do appreciate you you're taking your question or maybe I should say questions on DCP. But yes, our DCP is down by 1.5 days quarter-over-quarter and 0.9 days sequentially. And there's a lot of things that go into that calculation all the way from the number of days and the denominator can change on a quarter-over-quarter basis to various other aspects. I'll just state at the outset that our DCP will not get lower by reducing reserves. We have a very consistent and conservative methodology associated with our actuarial team. And in terms of coming up with reserves, those reserves are consistent here at March 31st as they were at December 31st and that there is no benefit to the income statement associated with this drop in DCP. So having that behind maybe talk a little bit about some of the mechanics that you asked about. We have a mix in the type of claims is obviously very important. And you look at a year ago, we were in the midst of the Omicron surge with COVID. COVID claims had a longer cycle time than other claims do. That had been the case through the entirety of the pandemic. And when you have a claim type that takes longer, both for the provider to bill us and for our adjudication process, the cycle time becomes longer, DCP just mathematically becomes a little bit inflated. And so with COVID being so much less in the first quarter of 2023 than it was in 2022 or 2021 for that matter, that cycle time is really very important, and so you see a drop. On reserves, and I made this comment in the prepared statements, but I think it's really important on the reserves, we have these retrospective provider pass-through payments that we get from our Medicaid partners, Medicaid states, And the amount of those reserves as of March of 2023 are $400 million less than they were at the end of March of 2022. And if we pulled out from the calculation from our reserves, these pass-through payments, which passed through by definition, have zero impact on net income. Then you would be able to see that our Medical Claims Payable balances have grown 10.1% year-over-year compared to a 9.4% growth in premium. Further, showing that our reserving methodologies are conservative, and our reserves are still very, very strong. So in terms of how long it's going to take to get to the low 40s, be another few years. And there's any number of constructs that could -- will occur. But we are starting to see payment cycles more consistent with pre-pandemic era payment cycles. And as those things are fully baked into the numbers, you should expect DCP to tweak down as a result. So thank you very much for the question and the opportunity to clarify all that. No, thank you for the question, A.J. We're certainly very comfortable with our MLR guidance and really pleased to report a first quarter medical loss ratio of 85.8%. And maybe reiterating what I stated at Investor Day, the overall cost structure and the overall trends are very much aligned with our expectations, consistent with our pricing methodologies and consistent with our thought process. Now those trends are slightly elevated from what cost trends were pre-pandemic level. But as I said, they're exactly in line with our expectations and exactly aligned with our pricing methodology. So our MLR certainly has improved from the first quarter of 2022. And I think you can see that coming through in the Health Benefits segment margins. But we're pretty comfortable with where trend sits right now compared to our expectations. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Nathan. Appreciate the question, and I'll start with the end of your question first. We are very confident that the utilization trends that we are seeing are captured on our MLR guidance for the year. So that is not an issue at all as we sit here today. In terms of some of the cost pressures, they said there are cost pressures and there are a lot of areas that are doing better than we had had anticipated. On the GLP-1, that's been talked about quite a bit. We've got a lot of protocols in there. I do want to make sure people are clear that GLP-1 is both weight loss and diabetes. And for weight loss, we do not cover weight loss drugs, with the exception of a few states where it's required by state law. So that's not really has ever been part of the conversation and was never part of any of the commentary. I just want to make sure everybody was clear on that. And then in terms of the diabetes drugs, certainly, we want to making sure that people who have diabetes that need access to those drugs are getting access to them, but to have the appropriate protocol, so that they're not utilized for purposes that are other than medical necessity for diabetes-type folks. And on the other side of the equation, we're still seeing very good trends, maybe in terms of ER is still below pandemic era or pre-pandemic era levels. We've got -- COVID is actually a bit less than we had estimated at this point in time. We had a more mild flu season. The timing of when we pay for the vaccine serum in terms of the boosters has now been pushed out later in the year. There are many, many, many estimates that go into trend. Overall, we are very comfortable with where we sit today. Thank you. Thank you, Dave. I'll start out with just addressing the acuity factor is what you were describing, which is now part of a standardized Medicaid rate renewal process associated with what the belief is the acuity of the population will be those covered, which is different than what existed in 2019. And so we feel very good about that. The acuity shifts are now a standard input into the actuarial rating models. And as I said, that was not the case in 2019. We -- this has started here already in 2023 in January. We work very closely with our state partners to ensure that we have actuarially justified rates. And since the acuity factors part of that actuarial assessment, we feel very, very good about it. In terms of the exact percentage, that's not something that we're going to talk about here publicly. Each state is different. Each state has its actuaries. We have our actuaries. We have had very, very good success at having the meeting of the minds with the vast majority of our states in terms of actuarially equivalent rates. So we feel very good about it. But nothing really has changed in terms of our ability to hit our numbers for the rest of the year and where we think are really our great catchers met that we have positions us well for Medicaid redeterminations regardless where the members end up going to seek health insurance coverage. Thank you for that question, Kevin. And I guess the first thing I really do have to say is we feel very good about where MLR came in and where trend came in, and it actually was a bit better than our expectations. So, when I look at what we have been projecting as of the beginning of the year, our 86.8% is actually positive to those expectations. In terms of pricing, our goal is always to price to cover forward trend and then to guide that way. We had said that for Commercial that there were some underlying cost structures associated with COVID that we needed to ensure that our pricing reflected not only forward trend, but also that so that our total pricing reflected the overall cost structure. I think we've done a very, very good job now here at the end of the first quarter of really trying to get -- hit that sweet spot of pricing to really retain a nice large cohort of our membership as well as to see the margin expansion. So, we actually feel very, very good about where the results are and do believe that we're a bit better than we had anticipated even 90 days ago. Yeah. Thanks, Steve. I appreciate the question. And as you think about the -- some of the tailwinds that we have in 2023, it certainly includes the repricing of commercial to better reflect the overall cost structure. We're still doing fine in Medicaid. And then as you pointed out, the Medicare Advantage we now have a higher percent star revenue than we did the year before, and our risk-adjusted scores are getting back to more normalized levels. So it definitely is one of the tailwinds that we are -- that we do have for 2023. So the fact that it wasn't in the prepared comments, don't read anything into that specifically other than to say that it's really -- it's a very good be a growing line of business for us over the next several years, and we feel very, very good about how well-positioned we are. And then with the three-year phase-in of the rate notice, I think we can certainly manage through that as well. So Medicare Advantage continues to be a very important line of business for us. Thank you."

            "name": "Morgan Kendrick",
            "content": "Lance, thanks for the question. When we think about the fee-based business, we've had a really, really strong run in the past several years. And I think that goes back and speaks to the health and the value that we're driving to the market, especially to the employers who are actually spending their own money. To your point, Carelon is a big, big piece of it. We had a really nice selling cycle this year, in fact, with the pharmacy business. We didn't see very many jumbos in the medical side. So thus, that was sort of absent from the actual Rx percentage as well for us. But nonetheless, we're seeing more and more attraction to this idea of the whole integrated delivery model of pharmacy medical together and the value that's delivering. Secondly, you think about the other products that are working with Carelon on, whether it's the behavioral health, whether these are sort of the incentive programs around payment integrity and bill review, things of that nature that are really important to our self-funded customers, that continues to see very strong growth and attraction from the market. That said, at the end of the day, Pete's team and my team are working together to build for purpose things that create value in the market. And again, I'll anchor back to the three things that Gail mentioned in the beginning in her opening remarks. The market is keenly focused on affordability, experience and simplicity. And the more that we can pull together, the better it's going to be for our markets. And I think the connection here between Carelon and the commercial fee-based business is strategically critical to that, continuing to drive growth. Pete, I'll turn it to you. Steven, one thing to camp on to Gail's comments there. When you think about our business, we're -- as she indicated, we're certainly not very indexed so to speak, in the hospitality industry, the tech industry. To Gail's point, it's more government business and you think about our downmarket business in particular. It's -- I don't like to use the word resilient, but it certainly is to a degree more so than others that have a different focus of the business. When you think about the recessionary times being negative, of course, it's interesting because the market tends to gravitate to certainty. And I think that's what we're seeing, when we're seeing employers consolidate benefit decisions into single vendor, when employers were having all-time high persistency rates, not only upmarket, but also down market, certainly experienced attrition in the risk-based business downmarket, which was purposeful as we written that book, but feel really good about the progress that we're making and feel really good about the way the assets are being seen and resonating in the market with our customers. Thank you. Kevin, thanks for the question, and Gail. I don't know there's a whole lot to add back to the comment around pace and sustainability of the business, Kevin. We took this very measured approach, certainly, looking at Medicaid redeterminations, we wanted to make sure we were expanding into the areas where we could serve as many members as we could in our 14 geographies. That said, the interesting thing about this cycle, we had a lot of ins and outs in the market with competitors that had come in and then left. So it left a lot of movement in the market that perhaps ordinarily wouldn't have occurred. So back to Gail's comments, we feel good about where we're positioned. We feel good about the economics behind it and are positioned well for when redetermination begins."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning and welcome to Elevance Health's third quarter 2024 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; Mark Kaye, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial Health Benefits Business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits Business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and our revised outlook for the year and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. Mark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our earnings call. Today, we will review our third quarter financial results, discuss our outlook for 2024 and provide an update on the operating environment. During the call, we will also highlight fundamental drivers of long-term growth for Elevance Health, which remains strong. For the third quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37 which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business. The impact on the third quarter and our full year outlook are being partially offset by focused medical management, the work we are doing with states to reflect the acuity of our members in rates and proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency, which will strengthen our business for the long term. We are navigating a challenging and dynamic operating environment and have reduced our full year outlook to prudently reflect these challenges. Given third quarter results and our expectation that timing disconnects between Medicaid rates and acuity currently facing the industry will continue. We have reduced our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share to approximately $33. Importantly, we are not leveraging the future to achieve short-term gains. We are investing to position Elevance Health for strong growth over the long term. The issues impacting the Medicaid business are time-bound and our state partners are working constructively with us on rate renewals. We're confident that rates will ultimately reflect the underlying acuity of our members albeit on a lag as states often use data that is more than a year old in setting rates. These short-term headwinds are a byproduct of the large scale and unprecedented mix shifts associated with the end of the public health emergency. Over the long term, Medicaid managed care is an attractive business that is integral and complementary to our other Health Benefits and Carelon businesses and offers significant growth opportunities, notably serving specialized populations where we provide distinct value with our unique capabilities. Across our health benefits business, we are diligently executing on our growth strategy. Our Medicaid team is working tirelessly with our state partners, and we appreciate the collaboration. While the rate increases we've received are the highest in the past decade, they are still inadequate to cover 2024 cost trend that we now expect to be 3x to 5x historical averages. We're confident that rates will reflect the acuity of our members as enrollment continues to stabilize, and we're acting with urgency to deliver significant operational efficiencies and appropriately manage the cost of care. Partnering with states as they expand managed care to beneficiaries with chronic or complex conditions aligns well with our specialized whole health solutions and is an important part of our growth strategy. In partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, we're pleased to be expanding our service to North Carolinians through the recent award of a sole source foster care contract covering nearly 60,000 new members. This marks the second sole source foster care win in 2024. In Medicare, we're taking deliberate steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business. We are now two days into the 2025 annual election period and are pleased with our positioning overall. We remain disciplined in our approach to 2025 bids, building on the actions we took to position our Medicare Advantage business for sustainable performance heading into 2024. For 2025, we took a balanced approach to margin and membership, prioritizing the benefits seniors value most to mitigate the impact of CMS' rate cuts on beneficiaries and promote access to high-quality, comprehensive and coordinated care for our members. Given the benefit reductions and meaningful market exits we made heading into 2024, we maintained greater stability in our offerings for 2025. And as a result, we expect to grow individual Medicare Advantage membership in line or slightly better than the broader market in 2025, led by products where we have strong, sustainable market position. Medicare Advantage Star quality ratings remain a key enterprise priority, and we're committed to our long-term goal of achieving and maintaining star ratings at the high end of all plans in our markets. For payment year 2026, we improved our own performance across nearly 60% of star measures and are pleased to be the only large payer to offer multiple five-star plans. Unfortunately, we will see the percentage of our members and plans rated four stars or higher decline due to significantly higher cut points. The entire decline in our four-star member mix was due to one of our larger age contracts narrowly missing a 4-star rating by 0.0004. We have challenged our initial scoring with CMS and are considering all of our options. Our commercial businesses are performing well and are on track to achieve their financial targets. We anticipate further growth in 2025 to be driven by increased penetration of our best-in-class products and services, given momentum in both of our individual exchange and national account businesses. For the largest employers, we offer differentiated value in innovative and attractive solutions and our focus on whole health in partnership with Carelon is resonating. In our individual exchange business, we're delivering particularly strong growth with membership up more than 30% year-to-date. As we look to 2025, we're expanding our individual and family ACA plans in three states: Florida, Maryland and Texas, under the WellPoint brand, which will complement our existing presence in these states while driving growth for our Health Benefits and Carelon segments. Focused geographic expansion enhances our ability to serve as a lifetime trusted health partner to consumers and our communities. Turning to Carelon. We're making significant progress in scaling our enterprise flywheel for growth. CarelonRx continues to expand its customer base while diversifying its value proposition. Earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, which is aligned with our strategy of controlling the levers that matter in delivering whole health affordably. Meanwhile, innovative solutions such as our SpecialtyRx Savings Navigator, weight management solutions and EnsureRx continue to gain traction and drive savings to clients. Growth in Carelon Services remains strong, and we are on track to exceed the upper end of our initial outlook for low 20s percentage revenue growth. This includes external growth above our initial targets for 2024, a proof point in first demonstrating our value proposition internally before driving growth externally. Carelon also recently entered into an agreement to acquire CareBridge, a value-based manager of home and community-based services for chronic and complex members that will serve as the foundation for Carelon\u2019s home health business, and we're excited to continue to serve all its customers and members. Carelon Services is expanding its capabilities to manage a growing proportion of health care spending, supporting the long-term growth of the business and by extension, the value it creates for health plan customers. Despite the challenges of the current environment, we're investing to position Elevance Health for sustained growth over the long term, including through the application of AI-driven solutions that are enhancing member and provider experiences, reducing costs and driving more efficient processes. We expect to realize operational and financial benefits in 2024 and greater impact in 2025 and beyond. For our members, we're integrating AI across touch points to provide personalized digital service, improve access to care and further increase satisfaction. We're also improving provider interactions and reducing costs by streamlining administrative tasks, automating onboarding and enhancing contract administration. And for our associates, we're investing in tools that increase productivity, reduce manual tasks and enhance efficiency across the organization. These are just a few of the AI applications we anticipate in the coming years as we focus on programs that can have the greatest impact guided by a mission to provide unmatched value to our members, providers and associates. In summary, our businesses remain fundamentally strong and we remain confident in the flywheel for long-term growth we're building with our complementary businesses. The issues impacting Medicaid are time bound, and we're acting with urgency to improve performance, and ensure adequate rates that reflect the acuity of our members. We are confident that we're making the right investments to position Elevance Health for strong and sustainable growth over the long term in service of consumers across all age and income levels and that we will emerge from this period of unprecedented change, stronger and even better positioned to serve the growing need for care management and cost containment in our health care system. Before closing, I would also like to thank our dedicated associates for their tireless commitment to our mission and for the work they do each and every day to deliver for all of our stakeholders. It is their dedication and passion for those that we're privileged to serve that is reflected in our ongoing recognition as a great place to work for the fifth consecutive year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Kaye, our CFO, to provide more details on our operating results and outlook. Mark?\nMark Kaye: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail has shared, we reported third quarter results, including GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.36 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $8.37 which came in below our expectations. We ended the third quarter with 45.8 million members, flat sequentially. Growth in commercial was largely offset by the loss of approximately 85,000 Medicaid members due to a specific footprint change that took effect at the beginning of September. Year-over-year, Commercial membership has grown by nearly 600,000 driven by strong fee-based and individual ACA health plan growth on the distinct value we deliver to large employers and the targeted local positioning of our product. Total operating revenue for the quarter was $44.7 billion, up over 5% year-over-year, reflecting strong reacceleration in growth from the low point last quarter. The consolidated benefit expense ratio was 89.5% for the third quarter, an increase of 270 basis points year-over-year, principally due to Medicaid cost trend developing worse than expected. While Medicaid rate increases will reach record levels this year, they remain inadequate to cover cost trend that is in the range of 3x to 5x historical averages. We are working closely with our state partners to ensure they fully capture the acuity of our Medicaid membership in future rates. During the quarter, we mitigated the impact through disciplined medical management and took further proactive actions to enhance operating efficiency across the enterprise. As a result, Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 9.6%, an improvement of 150 basis points. Adjusted operating gains for the quarter was $2.4 billion and $8.3 billion for the year-to-date period, primarily reflecting declines in our Medicaid business. We maintained a consistent and prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days in claims payable at the end of the third quarter stood at 42.8 days which remains slightly above our targeted range in the low 40s. Given third quarter results and our expectation that cost trend in our Medicaid business will remain elevated through at least the fourth quarter, we have reduced our full year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share to approximately $33. We now expect our 2024 benefit expense ratio will be more than 100 basis points higher than we anticipated last quarter, bringing the full year to approximately 88.5%. Full year operating cash flow is now expected to be approximately $4.5 billion. It's important to keep in mind that the issues impacting the Medicaid managed care industry are time bound, and we are confident that rates will ultimately reflect the underlying acuity of our Medicaid membership. It's also notable that in 2024, businesses representing more than half of our revenues will be operating at margins below the long-run potential. We expect margins will return to appropriate and sustainable levels over time. Turning to 2025. We expect continued momentum in our commercial business, bolstered by the expansion of exchange offerings into three new states, in the alignment of our value proposition in national and large group markets. We will deliver balanced growth in our Medicare Advantage business and stability in Medicaid as redeterminations return to a normal cadence. And we will further scale Carelon, our enterprise flywheel for growth with notable contributions from the expansion of specialty pharmacy dispensing capabilities in CarelonRx and continued momentum in Carelon Services as we drive greater product adoption internally and externally and build out our home and community-based business. Finally, we are undertaking bold actions to modernize and transform many of our core processes through the application of new technologies that will create structural efficiencies and long-term value. There is much to be excited about in 2025, and we expect strong acceleration in revenue growth, at least in line with our long-term growth algorithm in the high single-digit percent range. While we are confident that the issues impacting the Medicaid managed care industry are time bound, at this point in time, our outlook for 2025 adjusted EPS growth is at least in the mid-single-digit percent range. This reflects our assumption that the timing disconnect between Medicaid rates and acuity will continue. We will navigate this backdrop with the same focus and discipline that has been central to the long-term success of Elevance Health. Importantly, the earnings power of our diverse and complementary businesses remain strong, and we are confident in our ability to deliver at least 12% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share annually on average over time. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: So, in the slide deck, you're reiterating your expectation of 12% earnings growth from 22% to 27%. Which of that 22% base would suggest you get something like $51.27? But you're also saying off of the new base this year, you'll grow 5% next year which would give you something like 34%, 65% something in the high 34s. I guess the question is -- and it sounds like all of the short-term issues are around Medicaid is getting the right rates going to be sufficient to get you the kind of accelerated earnings growth in '26 and '27 that would get you back on track to hit that multiyear 12% CAGR target? Or should we rebase that given what we're looking at in '24 and '25?\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you for the question, A.J. Let me provide a little bit of high-level perspective around that because I think there's -- you have a lot of math in that question, but I think it's important certainly appreciate the dynamic environment that we're currently operating in. I think to really start that, first, we believe that the earnings power of our diverse and complementary businesses remained strong. So, feel good about thinking about at least 12% over the long term and an adjusted EPS of time. So, I think that's important. As you heard, and we're thinking about what's happening in our business right now, I'd like to sort of reiterate some of the things that Mark shared in his opening comments. First, strong acceleration in revenue growth, at least in line with our long-term algorithm in the high single-digit percentage. So, there's a lot I think to be excited about in our business, momentum in our commercial business going strong. We're entering several additional expanded ACA footprint next year. We feel good about the Medicare Advantage business, which we focus to be sustainable long-term growth. And Carelon is going to deliver even greater value as we look at the internal and external growth we're seeing in services and the robust pipeline in CarelonRx. And then, the last piece of that is continuing to realize substantial operational efficiencies. However, given the dynamics that we spoke about in the environment that we're in, we anticipate that Medicaid margins in '25 are going to remain belong our long-term target. But again, this is a timing disconnect between rates and acuity, which we do believe is time bound, but think that can persist through 2025. And also, it's really important that we are going to continue to make ongoing investments in '25 because we think that there's a powerful opportunity across our business. So taken together, we think that we're being prudent in how we think about '25 and our expectations at this pace and timing and that our guidance will give you a lot more detail in the fourth quarter. But I think you can rest assure, we're going to continue to navigate '25 with the same focus and discipline that has been central to our long-term success.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Just wanted to come back to the Medicaid discussion. Obviously, the magnitude of the revision that's implied there is alarming, particularly given that we're at the end of the membership impacts from redetermination. Just trying to understand better how things got so much worse so quickly. I guess how much of this is actually new to the third quarter versus not having a good reading on where things were last quarter? And to the extent there are new developments in the third quarter, can you better help us understand perhaps what some of those are?\nGail Boudreaux: Let me ask Mark Kaye, our CFO, to address your question. Thank you.\nMark Kaye: Stephen, good morning. Let me start off by noting that we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter. And additionally, we saw unfavorable prior period development related to the current year specifically in our Medicaid business. If I step back for a moment, the Medicaid cost trends accelerated in the quarter, they restated negatively for the current year. And as such, we're tracking in the range of around 3.5x -- 3x to 5x the historical average depending on the state. The elevated level of cost trend is driven -- and you heard us just in our prepared remarks, primarily by the higher overall membership acuity given the redetermination cycle is now substantially complete. And we are continuing to work with the states. We very much appreciate the collaboration. And while rate increases to-date have also been higher than the historical average they remain insufficient to fully cover the claims trends that we're seeing. And so, it's important to keep in mind that the state processes themselves typically rely on reference periods that lag current experience by as much as one to two years and while we are sharing more recent experience and trend information real time with the states, it's going to take time before that's fully reflected in their rate schedule.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: I just wanted to kind of drill in a little bit more on the pacing of the cash up of rates to acuity that you may expect over the coming year, probably you don't have perfect visibility into it, but are there any pockets, something Mark mentioned, the big bolus of members that kind of came off recently. Just -- are there any pockets of areas where you see a large bolus of members come off, acuity increase and then have a state renegotiation that could be kind of a catalyst for creating some accelerated recovery? Or how do you think about pacing of the recovery throughout next year?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. I'll ask Mark to comment on this as well. But I remember, this is one of the largest and unprecedented mix shifts. We've seen in Medicaid as the PHE has unwound over the course of the year. And again, as Mark said, what we saw was this acceleration through the third quarter. So, I think putting that in perspective is really important. We have not had an environment like this before in Medicaid. So, it's a very unusual time frame for us. But let me have Mark give a little bit more color on that.\nMark Kaye: And then, I think the only thing I'll add to Gail's remarks is that as we think about 2025, we do expect that mismatch between rates and acuity to narrow. Especially as the state rate updates increasingly reflect the underlying member acuity.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnn Hynes: Can you just give us a little bit more detail on the utilization trends like what is increasing more than your expectations? Is it inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy? Any color you could provide would be helpful.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks. I'll have Mark address that, please.\nMark Kaye: Maybe let me take this briefly from two perspectives. I'll do a little bit of Medicare then I'll do a Medicaid. So, Medicare in the quarter was slightly elevated. It was manageable overall reflected some incremental pressure related to the two-midnight rule. We also saw a late summer surge in COVID. On Medicaid, as I spoke about trends a minute ago, we are seeing some ongoing pockets of elevated trend. They're most notable in the behavioral health area. Overall that we do expect margins to continue to remain pressured through the rest of the year. And certainly, for those two businesses will remain below our long-term average in 2025.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks. And again, our results were predominantly driven by Medicaid. And as Mark said, we did see some slight pressure in Medicare, but feel very comfortable about where we positioned our bids for 2025. So, thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Tiffany on for Andrew. It looks like the 200 basis points of 3Q enterprise MLR miss like translates to about 500 basis points of Medicaid pressure in the quarter. One, is that the right ballpark to think about? And two like just given the apparent like 100s of basis points of incremental pressure, is the Medicaid book profitable today?\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. I'll ask Mark to respond to that as well.\nMark Kaye: Thank you very much for the question. The ballpark is about right for 2024. And as I think about the Medicaid business, it is expected to be profitable this year albeit below our target margin range for the year itself. It's important to note that you really can't look at the Medicaid marginal business in any particular single quarter. There are normal quarter-to-quarter dynamics of the business. But importantly, over the long term and we do expect the Medicaid managed care business to be a profitable and an attractive one for us and it's integral and it is complementary to either Health Benefits and Carelon businesses.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for that, Mark. And again, I just want to reiterate that we do believe this is time bound, and we also believe that Medicaid is a very good business, particularly the specialized populations where we have unique capabilities. But again, thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wilson: And I wanted to ask on Medicare Advantage. Just based on the analysis of sort of the MA landscape now and the latest kind of benefit design details. Is there -- is the competitive environment playing out as you would expect in terms of being fairly rational with a focus on kind of profit versus growth? Is it playing out according to plan there and driving some of that assumption in terms of your at or above market growth in MA next year?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Erin. First, I think it's really important to realize -- we feel well positioned in MA and we took a number of actions, prudent actions last year at the beginning of the year to position the business for long term. Importantly, we had a number of market exits of markets where we didn't think we saw long-term sustainability. And this year, we continue to look for stability and make sure that we are in this business for the long term. So, I'm going to ask Felicia to comment now that we're a few days into AEP and give you a perspective of our thoughts on the market.\nFelicia Norwood: Thank you, Gail, and thank you, Erin, for the question. Our strategy, as we look at Medicare Advantage, really didn't start this year around our approach to balancing membership and margins. We started last year to real take strategic actions in order to create a sustainable foundation for growth in our Medicare Advantage business, and that included exiting several underperforming markets, and that represented about 85,000 members. In addition to that, we made significant reductions in our supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico on the heel of some losses in 2023. So, as we put together our bid for 2025, we started the work with the foundation and wanted to make sure that we maintain stability where we need it to, but we want to be very focused on a balance between growth and margin, particularly in attractive and sustainable products and performance for us as we went forward. Specifically, we focus very much on our D-SNP business in our high-priority markets, where we have the assets and the cost structure to really support leading market share. Additionally, I want to note that our products are predominantly HMO, not PPO, and we were very prudent in our positioning, overlaying our local market dynamics and consumer preferences with our own market prioritization framework. So, when we look at where we are now only two days into AEP, we feel very good about how we're positioned in terms of our key products and our target market. We prudently navigated the environment and as we sit here today, as you said, we really expect to grow in line or slightly better than the market. But competitively, still, we're very positioned well as we head into this AEP.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: I wanted to follow up on your comments around Medicaid trend accelerating through the quarter and being 3x to 5x typical. To your point, I don't think anyone on this call has ever heard of trend being discussed in terms of multiples of typical. And given it got worse through the quarter, just curious if you could give us some color on what's going on through the quarter? Is it that you're seeing people come back on the roles that are sicker given the redeterminations themselves should have been, give or take, run out at this point? And then given it looks like the exit rate in the quarter is the lowest margin, the highest cost, it sounds like. Can you tell us where you were ending the quarter and where you expect to be for the fourth quarter versus that 3% to 4% margin target that we all think about?\nGail Boudreaux: Justin, thanks for the question. Just a couple of thoughts, and I'll ask Mark to provide a little bit more perspective. Remember, again, this was the most significant change we've seen in membership in Medicaid probably as long as I've been in this business, coming off of the PHE. And again, the driver was this acceleration that we saw through the third quarter. And we did plan for accelerated acuity in our business, which I think is important. But again, none of us when you're planning for 3x to 5x the cost structure. We've been working very diligently with our state partners in terms of understanding those rates and where we need to be. And again, they are looking at data oftentimes a year in arrears and have been responsive to changing their process, but it has not kept pace yet, and we think it will take them some time. With that, let me ask Mark to give a little bit more perspective on some of the other questions that you had embedded.\nMark Kaye: Yes. Justin, just to add additional color here as you heard from Gail, we definitely planned for an elevated level of trend in 2024 relative to the historic average Medicaid trend, which has run in the low single-digit percent range. And to the point we made earlier, that trend is now running around 3x to 5x historic average levels, of course, depending on the states and meaningfully above our expectations. And that's really driven by this unprecedented redetermination related activity which has resulted in several downstream changes in membership mix, membership count, acuity program adjustments, et cetera. I'd also like just to reiterate sort of that long-term target for Medicaid is in that 2% to 4% range.\nGail Boudreaux: And finally, Justin, to your point, we've also not been standing still. Obviously, we've been very active in managing the things that we can control around cost structure and acceleration of initiatives that we had in place around AI and making our business sustainable for the long term. And again, very active with our state partners, proud of our teams for the work that they've done to bring this forward. But again, we do think this will take time to work with our state partners to get the match at the appropriate level.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Gail, one of your peers talked about accelerating Rx trends in specialty. We've seen changes to IRA around catastrophic coverage. The one you haven't called out anything around Rx as far as cost trend goes. Are you seeing that how did you price for that going into 2025? And then just on the flip side, CarelonRx had very strong results. Is that a key driver of what we're seeing, especially on the specialty side and growth in specialty?\nGail Boudreaux: So, thanks for the question, Lisa. Let me go a little perspective directly on your question. I'll ask Pete Haytaian, who leads our pharmacy business to provide some more context. So year-to-date, we have seen an increase in Medicare Advantage Part D specialty drug utilization. But the trends in unit costs have been in line with our assumptions. So, we don't see it as a significant impact to what we've been talking about. Let me ask Pete to give you a little more perspective about what's happening in terms of overall pharmacy.\nPete Haytaian: Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. As you said, we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our CarelonRx strategy and growth. We continue down our path of in-sourcing the strategic levers that matter down our path of specialty pharmacy and infusion. We're making really good progress there. And as it relates to growth, our story is resonating in the marketplace. We're beginning to see a lot of pull-through in that regard. And we've had some nice wins going into 2025 upmarket as well. So that is all proceeding as planned. In terms of our overall performance from an operating margin perspective, though, as Gail said, we did expect what we saw in the specialty pharmacy trends. We did see that increase, but it was really as expected. When you look at our overall margins, the outperformance in the quarter was largely due to a onetime favorable revenue adjustment that was in for year. And when you even that out or spread that out through the year, the full year still remains on track in terms of our initial guidance around the 6%, 6.5% margin profile. So, we feel overall very good about where we are and where we are where we expected to be.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilke: Yes. Just a quick follow-up on the rate outlook for Medicaid. If you could just give some color on what you observed as far as rate increases maybe historically or in the first half of the year? And then what you're seeing in the second half of the year and what your outlook is based on how far you are along in early '25? And then the broader question was just are you anticipating making any strategic moves as a result of these pressures that again are time bounded? And as part of that, does this make any change in how you might in-source all of the functions of your PBM?\nGail Boudreaux: So, a lot of questions here, Lance. Thank you. Let me just address your question on strategic, then I'll ask Felicia specifically talk about Medicaid. We feel we've laid out a very comprehensive strategy around the growth drivers. And the opportunities, as I shared in the first question, really how we see acceleration in revenue and strong commercial business. We believe the time-bound issues around Medicaid, and we think we will work through those with the assets we have and then Medicare being well positioned. And Carelon is a real accelerator for us. And as you saw we announced an additional acquisition this morning as part of CareBridge that gives us home-based care and another pillar inside of our growth strategy for Carelon Services where we can take significantly more pass-through of the type of medical expense, we're managing inside of Carelon. So, I would say we're very focused on the long-term growth drivers in our flywheel for growth inside of Elevance Health and feel very positive about the fundamentals of our business. So strategically, I think we're moving forward in the exact same path that we've laid out. And in the pharmacy side, taking more control of the levers that matter for us, and you've continued to see us integrate the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy acquisition, our advanced home delivery. So, feel very good about that progress, and we're dealing with the time-based issues in Medicaid right now. But let me ask Felicia to address the Medicaid specifically.\nFelicia Norwood: So, Lance, thanks for the question. As you can imagine, the rate negotiations with our state partners are ongoing. And when you take a look at how our portfolio of business is spread out across the year, we have about half of our states that a January state and the other half that are July state than in the back half of the year. The work that we started with our states, certainly around the July states and rates certainly took a look at the '25 rates that they were working with us on. But we also put a lot of work into work with our states on understanding the trends that we're seeing in the first half of the year. As you heard earlier, the reference period for most of our states are 2023 when you think about the 25 rate setting process. So, there will certainly see that misalignment and that timing mismatch as we talk about. When we look at the work that we're seeing with our state partners, some states have certainly been more receptive to going back and taking a look at those and addressing those rates now. We've had certain states that have given us midyear rate adjustments and more of those will happen as we go through the back half of the year and early next year as well. But as you heard earlier, this is a process which you clearly understand that will take some time to actually get total alignment between our rates and the acuity of the membership that we're seeing on the heels of an unprecedented change in mix with respect to this business. But I will tell you, we are going to continue our strong advocacy working with our state partners, sharing up-to-date information around the changes that we're seeing, and we have full confidence that we will ultimately have rates that are aligned with the acuity of the membership in our population. So, thank you for the question.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Sorry to stay on the topic, but I'm still struggling with why the acuity rate mismatches accelerating now why this cost trend is accelerating now. My understanding is that most of the redeterminations have been done, right, that started over a year ago. So, it felt like there was less redetermination activity in the most recent quarter than previously. And I think -- last quarter, there was this conversation around higher utilization from members that were about to lose coverage. And so, you would have expected that to slow. So, I guess I'm still confused as to what's causing this big acceleration in this trend. Why is that happening so late in the process?\nMark Kaye: Josh, thanks very much for the question. Two key points I'd like you to keep in mind here. First, we've modeled a prudent view of costs for the fourth quarter. And you could think about that as us holding Medicaid trend approximately flat relative to where we were in September. And the second key point to keep in mind here is that we had unfavorable development related to the current year in the quarter.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Hall from Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Hall: Just to add on Medicaid topic. So based on your '24 guide, if I'm not mistaken implied 4Q impact actually seems to be larger than your third quarter MR pressure. So, it sounds like it's the case, but -- is this basically assuming the acuity rate mismatch worsened in the next quarter, even though you have all your September, October rate increases? And at this point, I guess, in mid-October, do you think you now have enough data and visibility into your own acuity mix that you can pass along to these states in time for Jan 1 renewals? Or just -- I presume draft rates are pretty already there? So, could they open that back up and adjust? Or is it too late?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. A couple of things, just a high level one. You also have to factor in seasonality into the fourth quarter. So make sure you're doing that, and I'll ask Felicia to talk a bit about Medicaid and the process that just goes on a rate setting.\nFelicia Norwood: Yes. So thank you so much for the question again. At this point, we have about 55% of our rate visibility for premium for January. However, those are draft rates. So, we spend a lot of time with our states right now, making sure that they understand the experience that we were seeing in the second and third quarters as we head into the rate setting process. So yes, when we have draft rates, the process is still iterative and ongoing and we are continuing to make sure that the states have visibility around that information. So, we have 55%, as I said, visibility into the January renewals, but those are early discussions, Michael, and expect a lot of work to happen between now and the end of the year in terms of the work between us and our state partners.\nMark Kaye: And maybe one comment just to add on to Felicia's remarks. Just to reaffirm, Medicaid trend is not expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter. It's primarily seasonality that's resulting in these numbers.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Langston from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRyan Langston: It sounds like you expect on the exchange side into 2025. So, I guess in that context, how should we think about the margin profile for maybe just the exchanges in the overall commercial business. I think you can [indiscernible] you're running this year?\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you very much for the question. We'll have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our commercial business to respond to that.\nMorgan Kendrick: Ryan, thank you for the question. We feel really good about our commercial business in aggregate. And certainly, the individual ACA is a big, big piece of that. We've taken a very disciplined approach over the last 36 months in gradually expanding our footprint and our competitiveness in our 14 geographies. As Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks upfront, we're expanding that in other markets. So, this year, we're expecting to have nice growth in our markets, probably improving share in the markets that we serve by about 2 points moving forward. That said, when I think about next year, we're positioned really well in the geographies where we've already served. We're in the process of sort of determining the positioning in the markets that we're moving into but are really excited about that business and it also being in line with our expectations on the economics.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. And just another thing to remember, those are states where we also have Medicaid and Medicare business. So, it aligns with us knowing those states well.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Just a sort of if you can maybe dimension for us and discuss some of the downstream impacts from the Medicaid environment to the Carelon Health businesses, you know that there's quite a bit of leverage or exposure in those businesses to Medicaid. So curious on how those businesses are performing and how you're positioning them around some of these dynamics we're seeing in Medicaid?\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks for the questions. I'll ask Pete to address your questions.\nPete Haytaian: Yes, Scott. No, I think it's a great question. I appreciate it. First, just stepping back and thinking about Carelon overall. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, overall, very pleased with the growth trajectory of Carelon Services, exceeding 30% growth in the quarter. Quarter year-over-year, not on a path to exceed initial guidance of the high teens to low 20s. So, we feel very good about that. And as it relates to growing internally and externally, I'll say that we're continuing down the path that we've been in with regard to proving out our solutions internally and then growing externally. I did want to point out that -- and as Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, seeing really nice traction externally. I'd say 4x improvement in terms of growth in 2024 and good visibility on 2025. As it relates to your question specifically, yes, we do have products oriented to Medicaid, Medicare, we are taking full risk. And as it relates to our performance overall, we are seeing some of those behavioral health trends play through. So, when you look at the margin profile in the short term, we are being impacted by the behavioral health trends. We are also being impacted by the acceleration in some of the risk arrangements that we're deploying. And as you recall, I think I've said it in the past, early on when we launched these risk arrangements, the margin profile is a bit more compressed and then as it evolves, it improves. So, the combination of those two factors is what's been affecting us in the short term. We feel very good about the long term and continuing to grow within the government program business as well as in the commercial business. We are pursuing a diversified approach just like the rest of Elevance Health.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: I just wanted to go back and follow up. I think it was Justin's question, not sure I actually heard the answer. Are the rejoiners coming back negatively impacting cost trends, like are they increasingly gaining access through the point of care through presumptive eligibility in the hospital or something like what does the actual care activity look like on the rejoiner population?\nMark Kaye: It's Mark here. Thank you very much for the follow-up here. There are a number of trend factors that are remaining to various degrees. And certainly, some have improved over the past quarters, think about like the pull forward effect to think about member mischaracterization and certainly some that are ongoing. What\u2019s really important here is that the state actuarial rate process and our ongoing discussions with them really aim to capture the overall cost of the members in ensuring the adequacy operates over time. On your question specifically, you could think about a portion of trained is being attributed primarily to the acuity mix shift versus -- I think we spoke about last quarter, so that same-store type trade utilization. And you could think about approximately 60% of the trend as being related to acuity mix. And the key point, as I'm going to sort of end here is that our embedded Medicaid outlook really does include prudent assumptions for cost trend in the fourth quarter, inclusive of all the underlying factors.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Mark, when you said Medicaid is profitable in '24, is that across all states? Or is it a mix of some profitable and some not? And then, can you just help us understand the actuarial soundness protection? Is that a two-year or a three-year period because we look at '24 and '25 as below target margins. But I think '23 was a good year for you guys on Medicaid. Does that still give you a position to pursue retroactive rate increases on top of the midyear rate updates you're targeting?\nMark Kaye: Sarah, thank you very much for the question here. I'm not going to talk about states specifically. But simply just to note, Medicaid margins on the whole are expected to compress significantly this year. And we started out this extensively. This is the industry-wide timing disconnect between rates and acuity. Our long-term expectations are unchanged. And that's because we are continuing to proactively collaborate with our state partners on integrating acuity into the rates that we're seeing. We know that's going to take time based on the state processes, the collection of data et cetera. And so, we're very confident that over time, rates will certainly appropriately on an actuarial and otherwise basis reflect the underlying acuity that we're experiencing. And so, I would certainly say that we are confident in our long-term targets that we have set out and we're committed to achieving them.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. And just reiterating, I think we do believe Medicaid is a long-term very good business for us. It's complementary to our other health benefits business and particularly around other specific populations that we think we have very unique skills to serve those. So again, thank you very much for your questions. We see Medicaid as a long term in this being an industry time-bound issue.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: I wanted to try to understand, respectively, the comments about kind of the cadence of rate recovery or achievement in caid and Medicaid, and then the confidence in MA bids for Medicare and with the question being in your mid-single-digit EPS growth for next year. Do you expect margins in caid and care, respectively, to be up, flat or down?\nGail Boudreaux: So, thank you very much for the question. Let me ask Mark, first to address your questions on margins. And then obviously, at this pace, we'll give you some directional commentary because it's still early in the year for '25 but we'll give you at least a sense of how we're thinking, Mark.\nMark Kaye: Overall, we expect for 2025 margins to continue to remain strong in commercial. Let me start there. On the Medicaid side, here, margins will remain below our long-term margin range and that's really predominantly related to the timing match that we've spoken about. You could think about them as effectively being stable year-over-year. And then on Medicare, because of the sustainability around our 2025 product positioning, we actually expect margins to improve in 2025 compared to 2024.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Joanna Gajuk from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoanna Gajuk: So just last question, I guess, on this Medicaid commentary, and I guess the margin commentary you just made in terms of margins being stable to be in next year. Is that, I guess, confirmation that you assume that by the end of '25, the Medicaid rate mismatch will be fully restored? Is that the way to read by the end of the year, it's going to be restored?\nMark Kaye: Thanks for the question. Let me actually step back for a second and think about MLR guidance for 2025, and we're not looking to provide that necessarily today, but let me share a few modeling considerations that might help you. First, again, with respect to the third quarter, we had some out-of-period items, including unfavorable into your development for the Medicaid business, and we do not expect that to repeat. As we progress towards and through 2025, you could think about that as a first half, second half story, where we expect the rate versus acuity mismatching Medicaid to narrow as the year progresses and as rates continue to improve. It's also important when you think about the modeling for the business to remember that January 1 is a major renewal base in our commercial business, right? And that marks the beginning of an end, we also marked the beginning of a new plan year for Medicare. So, we're remaining intensely focused on the appropriate medical management, and that's going to continue through 2025. I would say otherwise, it's too early to provide specific individual line of business guidance as we head into next year.\nGail Boudreaux: Right. And thanks, Mark. And just to reiterate that, we're taking a prudent view of the timing on the mismatch in Medicaid and want to be respectful of the safe process and the work we're doing, we feel that it has been a very good process with the states. But again, they have to get their data from prior periods. And so, we're trying to update them on what we're seeing. So again, it's early in the timing, but we wanted to give some our confidence in the long term of our business and the fundamentals. But again, I want to take a prudent view of what's happening in Medicaid, particularly on the state rate. We'll have one more question, please.\nOperator: And for a final question, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: And just kind of a couple of quick follow-ups here on the Medicaid again. I guess number one, Mark, could you provide more color on what drove the PYD in the quarter? And then I guess from a state concentration perspective is kind of -- is the discrepancy between rates and acuity broad-based? Or is -- are there state concentrations here that we should be concerned about, like that could speed the resolution of the issue?\nGail Boudreaux: So, in terms of your overall question, clearly, we manage a portfolio of states, and we don't get into specific states. But every state is a little bit different based on the population we serve and the programs that are in place. So, I wouldn't make it generalized across all states. I know that we are working very diligently with each of the states to make sure -- and again, this is industry-wide, not just unique to Elevance Health, and we see this across everything. So, thank you very much for the question. And now we'll turn, I think, to, first of all, say thank you, operator, and thank you for all the interest and support of everyone who has been on the line. I just want to reiterate, we're confident that we're making the right investments position Elevance Health for strong and sustainable growth over the long term and that we are confident we're going to emerge from this period of unprecedented to change even stronger. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Elevance Health, and thank you for joining us on this call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through November 16, 2024.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our earnings call. Today, we will review our third quarter financial results, discuss our outlook for 2024 and provide an update on the operating environment. During the call, we will also highlight fundamental drivers of long-term growth for Elevance Health, which remains strong. For the third quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share were $8.37 which was below our expectations, primarily due to elevated medical costs in our Medicaid business. The impact on the third quarter and our full year outlook are being partially offset by focused medical management, the work we are doing with states to reflect the acuity of our members in rates and proactive actions we are taking to enhance operating efficiency, which will strengthen our business for the long term. We are navigating a challenging and dynamic operating environment and have reduced our full year outlook to prudently reflect these challenges. Given third quarter results and our expectation that timing disconnects between Medicaid rates and acuity currently facing the industry will continue. We have reduced our outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share to approximately $33. Importantly, we are not leveraging the future to achieve short-term gains. We are investing to position Elevance Health for strong growth over the long term. The issues impacting the Medicaid business are time-bound and our state partners are working constructively with us on rate renewals. We're confident that rates will ultimately reflect the underlying acuity of our members albeit on a lag as states often use data that is more than a year old in setting rates. These short-term headwinds are a byproduct of the large scale and unprecedented mix shifts associated with the end of the public health emergency. Over the long term, Medicaid managed care is an attractive business that is integral and complementary to our other Health Benefits and Carelon businesses and offers significant growth opportunities, notably serving specialized populations where we provide distinct value with our unique capabilities. Across our health benefits business, we are diligently executing on our growth strategy. Our Medicaid team is working tirelessly with our state partners, and we appreciate the collaboration. While the rate increases we've received are the highest in the past decade, they are still inadequate to cover 2024 cost trend that we now expect to be 3x to 5x historical averages. We're confident that rates will reflect the acuity of our members as enrollment continues to stabilize, and we're acting with urgency to deliver significant operational efficiencies and appropriately manage the cost of care. Partnering with states as they expand managed care to beneficiaries with chronic or complex conditions aligns well with our specialized whole health solutions and is an important part of our growth strategy. In partnership with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, we're pleased to be expanding our service to North Carolinians through the recent award of a sole source foster care contract covering nearly 60,000 new members. This marks the second sole source foster care win in 2024. In Medicare, we're taking deliberate steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business. We are now two days into the 2025 annual election period and are pleased with our positioning overall. We remain disciplined in our approach to 2025 bids, building on the actions we took to position our Medicare Advantage business for sustainable performance heading into 2024. For 2025, we took a balanced approach to margin and membership, prioritizing the benefits seniors value most to mitigate the impact of CMS' rate cuts on beneficiaries and promote access to high-quality, comprehensive and coordinated care for our members. Given the benefit reductions and meaningful market exits we made heading into 2024, we maintained greater stability in our offerings for 2025. And as a result, we expect to grow individual Medicare Advantage membership in line or slightly better than the broader market in 2025, led by products where we have strong, sustainable market position. Medicare Advantage Star quality ratings remain a key enterprise priority, and we're committed to our long-term goal of achieving and maintaining star ratings at the high end of all plans in our markets. For payment year 2026, we improved our own performance across nearly 60% of star measures and are pleased to be the only large payer to offer multiple five-star plans. Unfortunately, we will see the percentage of our members and plans rated four stars or higher decline due to significantly higher cut points. The entire decline in our four-star member mix was due to one of our larger age contracts narrowly missing a 4-star rating by 0.0004. We have challenged our initial scoring with CMS and are considering all of our options. Our commercial businesses are performing well and are on track to achieve their financial targets. We anticipate further growth in 2025 to be driven by increased penetration of our best-in-class products and services, given momentum in both of our individual exchange and national account businesses. For the largest employers, we offer differentiated value in innovative and attractive solutions and our focus on whole health in partnership with Carelon is resonating. In our individual exchange business, we're delivering particularly strong growth with membership up more than 30% year-to-date. As we look to 2025, we're expanding our individual and family ACA plans in three states: Florida, Maryland and Texas, under the WellPoint brand, which will complement our existing presence in these states while driving growth for our Health Benefits and Carelon segments. Focused geographic expansion enhances our ability to serve as a lifetime trusted health partner to consumers and our communities. Turning to Carelon. We're making significant progress in scaling our enterprise flywheel for growth. CarelonRx continues to expand its customer base while diversifying its value proposition. Earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, which is aligned with our strategy of controlling the levers that matter in delivering whole health affordably. Meanwhile, innovative solutions such as our SpecialtyRx Savings Navigator, weight management solutions and EnsureRx continue to gain traction and drive savings to clients. Growth in Carelon Services remains strong, and we are on track to exceed the upper end of our initial outlook for low 20s percentage revenue growth. This includes external growth above our initial targets for 2024, a proof point in first demonstrating our value proposition internally before driving growth externally. Carelon also recently entered into an agreement to acquire CareBridge, a value-based manager of home and community-based services for chronic and complex members that will serve as the foundation for Carelon's home health business, and we're excited to continue to serve all its customers and members. Carelon Services is expanding its capabilities to manage a growing proportion of health care spending, supporting the long-term growth of the business and by extension, the value it creates for health plan customers. Despite the challenges of the current environment, we're investing to position Elevance Health for sustained growth over the long term, including through the application of AI-driven solutions that are enhancing member and provider experiences, reducing costs and driving more efficient processes. We expect to realize operational and financial benefits in 2024 and greater impact in 2025 and beyond. For our members, we're integrating AI across touch points to provide personalized digital service, improve access to care and further increase satisfaction. We're also improving provider interactions and reducing costs by streamlining administrative tasks, automating onboarding and enhancing contract administration. And for our associates, we're investing in tools that increase productivity, reduce manual tasks and enhance efficiency across the organization. These are just a few of the AI applications we anticipate in the coming years as we focus on programs that can have the greatest impact guided by a mission to provide unmatched value to our members, providers and associates. In summary, our businesses remain fundamentally strong and we remain confident in the flywheel for long-term growth we're building with our complementary businesses. The issues impacting Medicaid are time bound, and we're acting with urgency to improve performance, and ensure adequate rates that reflect the acuity of our members. We are confident that we're making the right investments to position Elevance Health for strong and sustainable growth over the long term in service of consumers across all age and income levels and that we will emerge from this period of unprecedented change, stronger and even better positioned to serve the growing need for care management and cost containment in our health care system. Before closing, I would also like to thank our dedicated associates for their tireless commitment to our mission and for the work they do each and every day to deliver for all of our stakeholders. It is their dedication and passion for those that we're privileged to serve that is reflected in our ongoing recognition as a great place to work for the fifth consecutive year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Kaye, our CFO, to provide more details on our operating results and outlook. Mark? Thank you for the question, A.J. Let me provide a little bit of high-level perspective around that because I think there's -- you have a lot of math in that question, but I think it's important certainly appreciate the dynamic environment that we're currently operating in. I think to really start that, first, we believe that the earnings power of our diverse and complementary businesses remained strong. So, feel good about thinking about at least 12% over the long term and an adjusted EPS of time. So, I think that's important. As you heard, and we're thinking about what's happening in our business right now, I'd like to sort of reiterate some of the things that Mark shared in his opening comments. First, strong acceleration in revenue growth, at least in line with our long-term algorithm in the high single-digit percentage. So, there's a lot I think to be excited about in our business, momentum in our commercial business going strong. We're entering several additional expanded ACA footprint next year. We feel good about the Medicare Advantage business, which we focus to be sustainable long-term growth. And Carelon is going to deliver even greater value as we look at the internal and external growth we're seeing in services and the robust pipeline in CarelonRx. And then, the last piece of that is continuing to realize substantial operational efficiencies. However, given the dynamics that we spoke about in the environment that we're in, we anticipate that Medicaid margins in '25 are going to remain belong our long-term target. But again, this is a timing disconnect between rates and acuity, which we do believe is time bound, but think that can persist through 2025. And also, it's really important that we are going to continue to make ongoing investments in '25 because we think that there's a powerful opportunity across our business. So taken together, we think that we're being prudent in how we think about '25 and our expectations at this pace and timing and that our guidance will give you a lot more detail in the fourth quarter. But I think you can rest assure, we're going to continue to navigate '25 with the same focus and discipline that has been central to our long-term success. Let me ask Mark Kaye, our CFO, to address your question. Thank you. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ben. I'll ask Mark to comment on this as well. But I remember, this is one of the largest and unprecedented mix shifts. We've seen in Medicaid as the PHE has unwound over the course of the year. And again, as Mark said, what we saw was this acceleration through the third quarter. So, I think putting that in perspective is really important. We have not had an environment like this before in Medicaid. So, it's a very unusual time frame for us. But let me have Mark give a little bit more color on that. Thanks. I'll have Mark address that, please. Yes. Thanks. And again, our results were predominantly driven by Medicaid. And as Mark said, we did see some slight pressure in Medicare, but feel very comfortable about where we positioned our bids for 2025. So, thank you. Next question, please. Thank you. I'll ask Mark to respond to that as well. Thanks for that, Mark. And again, I just want to reiterate that we do believe this is time bound, and we also believe that Medicaid is a very good business, particularly the specialized populations where we have unique capabilities. But again, thank you for the question. Thanks for the question, Erin. First, I think it's really important to realize -- we feel well positioned in MA and we took a number of actions, prudent actions last year at the beginning of the year to position the business for long term. Importantly, we had a number of market exits of markets where we didn't think we saw long-term sustainability. And this year, we continue to look for stability and make sure that we are in this business for the long term. So, I'm going to ask Felicia to comment now that we're a few days into AEP and give you a perspective of our thoughts on the market. Justin, thanks for the question. Just a couple of thoughts, and I'll ask Mark to provide a little bit more perspective. Remember, again, this was the most significant change we've seen in membership in Medicaid probably as long as I've been in this business, coming off of the PHE. And again, the driver was this acceleration that we saw through the third quarter. And we did plan for accelerated acuity in our business, which I think is important. But again, none of us when you're planning for 3x to 5x the cost structure. We've been working very diligently with our state partners in terms of understanding those rates and where we need to be. And again, they are looking at data oftentimes a year in arrears and have been responsive to changing their process, but it has not kept pace yet, and we think it will take them some time. With that, let me ask Mark to give a little bit more perspective on some of the other questions that you had embedded. And finally, Justin, to your point, we've also not been standing still. Obviously, we've been very active in managing the things that we can control around cost structure and acceleration of initiatives that we had in place around AI and making our business sustainable for the long term. And again, very active with our state partners, proud of our teams for the work that they've done to bring this forward. But again, we do think this will take time to work with our state partners to get the match at the appropriate level. So, thanks for the question, Lisa. Let me go a little perspective directly on your question. I'll ask Pete Haytaian, who leads our pharmacy business to provide some more context. So year-to-date, we have seen an increase in Medicare Advantage Part D specialty drug utilization. But the trends in unit costs have been in line with our assumptions. So, we don't see it as a significant impact to what we've been talking about. Let me ask Pete to give you a little more perspective about what's happening in terms of overall pharmacy. So, a lot of questions here, Lance. Thank you. Let me just address your question on strategic, then I'll ask Felicia specifically talk about Medicaid. We feel we've laid out a very comprehensive strategy around the growth drivers. And the opportunities, as I shared in the first question, really how we see acceleration in revenue and strong commercial business. We believe the time-bound issues around Medicaid, and we think we will work through those with the assets we have and then Medicare being well positioned. And Carelon is a real accelerator for us. And as you saw we announced an additional acquisition this morning as part of CareBridge that gives us home-based care and another pillar inside of our growth strategy for Carelon Services where we can take significantly more pass-through of the type of medical expense, we're managing inside of Carelon. So, I would say we're very focused on the long-term growth drivers in our flywheel for growth inside of Elevance Health and feel very positive about the fundamentals of our business. So strategically, I think we're moving forward in the exact same path that we've laid out. And in the pharmacy side, taking more control of the levers that matter for us, and you've continued to see us integrate the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy acquisition, our advanced home delivery. So, feel very good about that progress, and we're dealing with the time-based issues in Medicaid right now. But let me ask Felicia to address the Medicaid specifically. Yes. A couple of things, just a high level one. You also have to factor in seasonality into the fourth quarter. So make sure you're doing that, and I'll ask Felicia to talk a bit about Medicaid and the process that just goes on a rate setting. Thank you very much for the question. We'll have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our commercial business to respond to that. Thank you. And just another thing to remember, those are states where we also have Medicaid and Medicare business. So, it aligns with us knowing those states well. Yes. Thanks for the questions. I'll ask Pete to address your questions. Thank you. And just reiterating, I think we do believe Medicaid is a long-term very good business for us. It's complementary to our other health benefits business and particularly around other specific populations that we think we have very unique skills to serve those. So again, thank you very much for your questions. We see Medicaid as a long term in this being an industry time-bound issue. So, thank you very much for the question. Let me ask Mark, first to address your questions on margins. And then obviously, at this pace, we'll give you some directional commentary because it's still early in the year for '25 but we'll give you at least a sense of how we're thinking, Mark. Right. And thanks, Mark. And just to reiterate that, we're taking a prudent view of the timing on the mismatch in Medicaid and want to be respectful of the safe process and the work we're doing, we feel that it has been a very good process with the states. But again, they have to get their data from prior periods. And so, we're trying to update them on what we're seeing. So again, it's early in the timing, but we wanted to give some our confidence in the long term of our business and the fundamentals. But again, I want to take a prudent view of what's happening in Medicaid, particularly on the state rate. We'll have one more question, please. So, in terms of your overall question, clearly, we manage a portfolio of states, and we don't get into specific states. But every state is a little bit different based on the population we serve and the programs that are in place. So, I wouldn't make it generalized across all states. I know that we are working very diligently with each of the states to make sure -- and again, this is industry-wide, not just unique to Elevance Health, and we see this across everything. So, thank you very much for the question. And now we'll turn, I think, to, first of all, say thank you, operator, and thank you for all the interest and support of everyone who has been on the line. I just want to reiterate, we're confident that we're making the right investments position Elevance Health for strong and sustainable growth over the long term and that we are confident we're going to emerge from this period of unprecedented to change even stronger. Thank you, everyone, for your interest in Elevance Health, and thank you for joining us on this call."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and thank you, Erin, for the question. Our strategy, as we look at Medicare Advantage, really didn't start this year around our approach to balancing membership and margins. We started last year to real take strategic actions in order to create a sustainable foundation for growth in our Medicare Advantage business, and that included exiting several underperforming markets, and that represented about 85,000 members. In addition to that, we made significant reductions in our supplemental benefits in Puerto Rico on the heel of some losses in 2023. So, as we put together our bid for 2025, we started the work with the foundation and wanted to make sure that we maintain stability where we need it to, but we want to be very focused on a balance between growth and margin, particularly in attractive and sustainable products and performance for us as we went forward. Specifically, we focus very much on our D-SNP business in our high-priority markets, where we have the assets and the cost structure to really support leading market share. Additionally, I want to note that our products are predominantly HMO, not PPO, and we were very prudent in our positioning, overlaying our local market dynamics and consumer preferences with our own market prioritization framework. So, when we look at where we are now only two days into AEP, we feel very good about how we're positioned in terms of our key products and our target market. We prudently navigated the environment and as we sit here today, as you said, we really expect to grow in line or slightly better than the market. But competitively, still, we're very positioned well as we head into this AEP. So, Lance, thanks for the question. As you can imagine, the rate negotiations with our state partners are ongoing. And when you take a look at how our portfolio of business is spread out across the year, we have about half of our states that a January state and the other half that are July state than in the back half of the year. The work that we started with our states, certainly around the July states and rates certainly took a look at the '25 rates that they were working with us on. But we also put a lot of work into work with our states on understanding the trends that we're seeing in the first half of the year. As you heard earlier, the reference period for most of our states are 2023 when you think about the 25 rate setting process. So, there will certainly see that misalignment and that timing mismatch as we talk about. When we look at the work that we're seeing with our state partners, some states have certainly been more receptive to going back and taking a look at those and addressing those rates now. We've had certain states that have given us midyear rate adjustments and more of those will happen as we go through the back half of the year and early next year as well. But as you heard earlier, this is a process which you clearly understand that will take some time to actually get total alignment between our rates and the acuity of the membership that we're seeing on the heels of an unprecedented change in mix with respect to this business. But I will tell you, we are going to continue our strong advocacy working with our state partners, sharing up-to-date information around the changes that we're seeing, and we have full confidence that we will ultimately have rates that are aligned with the acuity of the membership in our population. So, thank you for the question. Yes. So thank you so much for the question again. At this point, we have about 55% of our rate visibility for premium for January. However, those are draft rates. So, we spend a lot of time with our states right now, making sure that they understand the experience that we were seeing in the second and third quarters as we head into the rate setting process. So yes, when we have draft rates, the process is still iterative and ongoing and we are continuing to make sure that the states have visibility around that information. So, we have 55%, as I said, visibility into the January renewals, but those are early discussions, Michael, and expect a lot of work to happen between now and the end of the year in terms of the work between us and our state partners."

            "content": "Ryan, thank you for the question. We feel really good about our commercial business in aggregate. And certainly, the individual ACA is a big, big piece of that. We've taken a very disciplined approach over the last 36 months in gradually expanding our footprint and our competitiveness in our 14 geographies. As Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks upfront, we're expanding that in other markets. So, this year, we're expecting to have nice growth in our markets, probably improving share in the markets that we serve by about 2 points moving forward. That said, when I think about next year, we're positioned really well in the geographies where we've already served. We're in the process of sort of determining the positioning in the markets that we're moving into but are really excited about that business and it also being in line with our expectations on the economics."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mark Kaye",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail has shared, we reported third quarter results, including GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.36 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $8.37 which came in below our expectations. We ended the third quarter with 45.8 million members, flat sequentially. Growth in commercial was largely offset by the loss of approximately 85,000 Medicaid members due to a specific footprint change that took effect at the beginning of September. Year-over-year, Commercial membership has grown by nearly 600,000 driven by strong fee-based and individual ACA health plan growth on the distinct value we deliver to large employers and the targeted local positioning of our product. Total operating revenue for the quarter was $44.7 billion, up over 5% year-over-year, reflecting strong reacceleration in growth from the low point last quarter. The consolidated benefit expense ratio was 89.5% for the third quarter, an increase of 270 basis points year-over-year, principally due to Medicaid cost trend developing worse than expected. While Medicaid rate increases will reach record levels this year, they remain inadequate to cover cost trend that is in the range of 3x to 5x historical averages. We are working closely with our state partners to ensure they fully capture the acuity of our Medicaid membership in future rates. During the quarter, we mitigated the impact through disciplined medical management and took further proactive actions to enhance operating efficiency across the enterprise. As a result, Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 9.6%, an improvement of 150 basis points. Adjusted operating gains for the quarter was $2.4 billion and $8.3 billion for the year-to-date period, primarily reflecting declines in our Medicaid business. We maintained a consistent and prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days in claims payable at the end of the third quarter stood at 42.8 days which remains slightly above our targeted range in the low 40s. Given third quarter results and our expectation that cost trend in our Medicaid business will remain elevated through at least the fourth quarter, we have reduced our full year outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share to approximately $33. We now expect our 2024 benefit expense ratio will be more than 100 basis points higher than we anticipated last quarter, bringing the full year to approximately 88.5%. Full year operating cash flow is now expected to be approximately $4.5 billion. It's important to keep in mind that the issues impacting the Medicaid managed care industry are time bound, and we are confident that rates will ultimately reflect the underlying acuity of our Medicaid membership. It's also notable that in 2024, businesses representing more than half of our revenues will be operating at margins below the long-run potential. We expect margins will return to appropriate and sustainable levels over time. Turning to 2025. We expect continued momentum in our commercial business, bolstered by the expansion of exchange offerings into three new states, in the alignment of our value proposition in national and large group markets. We will deliver balanced growth in our Medicare Advantage business and stability in Medicaid as redeterminations return to a normal cadence. And we will further scale Carelon, our enterprise flywheel for growth with notable contributions from the expansion of specialty pharmacy dispensing capabilities in CarelonRx and continued momentum in Carelon Services as we drive greater product adoption internally and externally and build out our home and community-based business. Finally, we are undertaking bold actions to modernize and transform many of our core processes through the application of new technologies that will create structural efficiencies and long-term value. There is much to be excited about in 2025, and we expect strong acceleration in revenue growth, at least in line with our long-term growth algorithm in the high single-digit percent range. While we are confident that the issues impacting the Medicaid managed care industry are time bound, at this point in time, our outlook for 2025 adjusted EPS growth is at least in the mid-single-digit percent range. This reflects our assumption that the timing disconnect between Medicaid rates and acuity will continue. We will navigate this backdrop with the same focus and discipline that has been central to the long-term success of Elevance Health. Importantly, the earnings power of our diverse and complementary businesses remain strong, and we are confident in our ability to deliver at least 12% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share annually on average over time. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions. Stephen, good morning. Let me start off by noting that we experienced accelerated cost trends in Medicaid throughout the third quarter. And additionally, we saw unfavorable prior period development related to the current year specifically in our Medicaid business. If I step back for a moment, the Medicaid cost trends accelerated in the quarter, they restated negatively for the current year. And as such, we're tracking in the range of around 3.5x -- 3x to 5x the historical average depending on the state. The elevated level of cost trend is driven -- and you heard us just in our prepared remarks, primarily by the higher overall membership acuity given the redetermination cycle is now substantially complete. And we are continuing to work with the states. We very much appreciate the collaboration. And while rate increases to-date have also been higher than the historical average they remain insufficient to fully cover the claims trends that we're seeing. And so, it's important to keep in mind that the state processes themselves typically rely on reference periods that lag current experience by as much as one to two years and while we are sharing more recent experience and trend information real time with the states, it's going to take time before that's fully reflected in their rate schedule. And then, I think the only thing I'll add to Gail's remarks is that as we think about 2025, we do expect that mismatch between rates and acuity to narrow. Especially as the state rate updates increasingly reflect the underlying member acuity. Maybe let me take this briefly from two perspectives. I'll do a little bit of Medicare then I'll do a Medicaid. So, Medicare in the quarter was slightly elevated. It was manageable overall reflected some incremental pressure related to the two-midnight rule. We also saw a late summer surge in COVID. On Medicaid, as I spoke about trends a minute ago, we are seeing some ongoing pockets of elevated trend. They're most notable in the behavioral health area. Overall that we do expect margins to continue to remain pressured through the rest of the year. And certainly, for those two businesses will remain below our long-term average in 2025. Thank you very much for the question. The ballpark is about right for 2024. And as I think about the Medicaid business, it is expected to be profitable this year albeit below our target margin range for the year itself. It's important to note that you really can't look at the Medicaid marginal business in any particular single quarter. There are normal quarter-to-quarter dynamics of the business. But importantly, over the long term and we do expect the Medicaid managed care business to be a profitable and an attractive one for us and it's integral and it is complementary to either Health Benefits and Carelon businesses. Yes. Justin, just to add additional color here as you heard from Gail, we definitely planned for an elevated level of trend in 2024 relative to the historic average Medicaid trend, which has run in the low single-digit percent range. And to the point we made earlier, that trend is now running around 3x to 5x historic average levels, of course, depending on the states and meaningfully above our expectations. And that's really driven by this unprecedented redetermination related activity which has resulted in several downstream changes in membership mix, membership count, acuity program adjustments, et cetera. I'd also like just to reiterate sort of that long-term target for Medicaid is in that 2% to 4% range. Josh, thanks very much for the question. Two key points I'd like you to keep in mind here. First, we've modeled a prudent view of costs for the fourth quarter. And you could think about that as us holding Medicaid trend approximately flat relative to where we were in September. And the second key point to keep in mind here is that we had unfavorable development related to the current year in the quarter. And maybe one comment just to add on to Felicia's remarks. Just to reaffirm, Medicaid trend is not expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter. It's primarily seasonality that's resulting in these numbers. It's Mark here. Thank you very much for the follow-up here. There are a number of trend factors that are remaining to various degrees. And certainly, some have improved over the past quarters, think about like the pull forward effect to think about member mischaracterization and certainly some that are ongoing. What's really important here is that the state actuarial rate process and our ongoing discussions with them really aim to capture the overall cost of the members in ensuring the adequacy operates over time. On your question specifically, you could think about a portion of trained is being attributed primarily to the acuity mix shift versus -- I think we spoke about last quarter, so that same-store type trade utilization. And you could think about approximately 60% of the trend as being related to acuity mix. And the key point, as I'm going to sort of end here is that our embedded Medicaid outlook really does include prudent assumptions for cost trend in the fourth quarter, inclusive of all the underlying factors. Sarah, thank you very much for the question here. I'm not going to talk about states specifically. But simply just to note, Medicaid margins on the whole are expected to compress significantly this year. And we started out this extensively. This is the industry-wide timing disconnect between rates and acuity. Our long-term expectations are unchanged. And that's because we are continuing to proactively collaborate with our state partners on integrating acuity into the rates that we're seeing. We know that's going to take time based on the state processes, the collection of data et cetera. And so, we're very confident that over time, rates will certainly appropriately on an actuarial and otherwise basis reflect the underlying acuity that we're experiencing. And so, I would certainly say that we are confident in our long-term targets that we have set out and we're committed to achieving them. Overall, we expect for 2025 margins to continue to remain strong in commercial. Let me start there. On the Medicaid side, here, margins will remain below our long-term margin range and that's really predominantly related to the timing match that we've spoken about. You could think about them as effectively being stable year-over-year. And then on Medicare, because of the sustainability around our 2025 product positioning, we actually expect margins to improve in 2025 compared to 2024. Thanks for the question. Let me actually step back for a second and think about MLR guidance for 2025, and we're not looking to provide that necessarily today, but let me share a few modeling considerations that might help you. First, again, with respect to the third quarter, we had some out-of-period items, including unfavorable into your development for the Medicaid business, and we do not expect that to repeat. As we progress towards and through 2025, you could think about that as a first half, second half story, where we expect the rate versus acuity mismatching Medicaid to narrow as the year progresses and as rates continue to improve. It's also important when you think about the modeling for the business to remember that January 1 is a major renewal base in our commercial business, right? And that marks the beginning of an end, we also marked the beginning of a new plan year for Medicare. So, we're remaining intensely focused on the appropriate medical management, and that's going to continue through 2025. I would say otherwise, it's too early to provide specific individual line of business guidance as we head into next year."

            "name": "Pete Haytaian",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. As you said, we're very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our CarelonRx strategy and growth. We continue down our path of in-sourcing the strategic levers that matter down our path of specialty pharmacy and infusion. We're making really good progress there. And as it relates to growth, our story is resonating in the marketplace. We're beginning to see a lot of pull-through in that regard. And we've had some nice wins going into 2025 upmarket as well. So that is all proceeding as planned. In terms of our overall performance from an operating margin perspective, though, as Gail said, we did expect what we saw in the specialty pharmacy trends. We did see that increase, but it was really as expected. When you look at our overall margins, the outperformance in the quarter was largely due to a onetime favorable revenue adjustment that was in for year. And when you even that out or spread that out through the year, the full year still remains on track in terms of our initial guidance around the 6%, 6.5% margin profile. So, we feel overall very good about where we are and where we are where we expected to be. Yes, Scott. No, I think it's a great question. I appreciate it. First, just stepping back and thinking about Carelon overall. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, overall, very pleased with the growth trajectory of Carelon Services, exceeding 30% growth in the quarter. Quarter year-over-year, not on a path to exceed initial guidance of the high teens to low 20s. So, we feel very good about that. And as it relates to growing internally and externally, I'll say that we're continuing down the path that we've been in with regard to proving out our solutions internally and then growing externally. I did want to point out that -- and as Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, seeing really nice traction externally. I'd say 4x improvement in terms of growth in 2024 and good visibility on 2025. As it relates to your question specifically, yes, we do have products oriented to Medicaid, Medicare, we are taking full risk. And as it relates to our performance overall, we are seeing some of those behavioral health trends play through. So, when you look at the margin profile in the short term, we are being impacted by the behavioral health trends. We are also being impacted by the acceleration in some of the risk arrangements that we're deploying. And as you recall, I think I've said it in the past, early on when we launched these risk arrangements, the margin profile is a bit more compressed and then as it evolves, it improves. So, the combination of those two factors is what's been affecting us in the short term. We feel very good about the long term and continuing to grow within the government program business as well as in the commercial business. We are pursuing a diversified approach just like the rest of Elevance Health."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Elevance Health Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's second quarter 2024 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; Mark Kaye, our CFO; Pete Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial Health Benefits business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter and recent progress against our strategic initiatives. Mark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's earnings call. This morning, we reported second quarter results, including adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.12, reflecting 12% growth year-on-year. These results reflect thoughtful execution in a dynamic operating environment as well as the unique strengths of our enterprise, including the power of our diverse set of businesses. We have reaffirmed our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of at least $37.20, which represents 12% growth year-over-year. We have prudently maintained our full year outlook, given industry-wide dynamics we are navigating in our Medicaid business and the investments we are making to support business transformation and deepen capabilities within CarelonRx. Our Health Benefits segment demonstrated balance and resilience in the quarter. In Commercial, we continue to make progress on our margin recovery initiative and are delivering solid membership growth, notably in our individual ACA business which has grown substantially year-over-year. We've also extended our momentum in national accounts where the business is tracking to historically high retention levels and new customer acquisition remains strong. Year-to-date, we've consolidated business with additional existing employer group clients who previously only worked with us on a slice of their business, a testament to the unique value we deliver to the market. In Medicaid, we are pleased with our recent new business wins and re-procurement success, positioning us for future growth. We launched the Indiana Pathways for Aging program just weeks ago and are proud to be the largest payer in this important program in our home state, serving nearly 40% of all eligible Hoosiers. Indiana Pathways plays directly to our strengths, serving populations with chronic and complex needs. We were also privileged to be awarded the KanCare Kansas Medicaid RFP this quarter, working in partnership alongside two Blue partners as Healthy Blue. Turning to Medicaid redeterminations. While nearly all of our members have had their eligibility redetermined since the process resumed last year, our work is not done. With approximately 70% of coverage losses attributable to administrative challenges, we continue our proactive outreach to members to maximize access to care and minimize barriers to whole health. We expect disenrolled members to re-enroll throughout the year, albeit on a longer lag than expected when redeterminations resumed last year, We are seeing the percentage of returners steadily increase, especially in our Blue states where we offer both Commercial and Medicaid health plans. As a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity and we are working actively with our state partners to ensure rates remain actuarily sound. In Medicare, we were pleased with the recent ruling regarding our challenge of the initial 2024 Star ratings. As a result, our enterprise weighted-average rating has increased to 4.0 Star and we now expect approximately 56% of our members will be in plans rated at least 4.0 Star or in contracts too new to be rated that will be reimbursed similarly in payment year 2025. This outcome will help offset funding cuts to the Medicare Advantage program for the second consecutive year, which we believe will result in increased premiums and/or reduced benefits for seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Medicare Advantage for their health and wellbeing. For our part, we maintained our disciplined approach to 2025 bids. We will be offering highly valued and competitive benefits as we seek to balance growth and margins and remain focused on building an attractive and sustainable Medicare Advantage business for the long term. In our Health Services businesses, we are making progress on our key strategic priority to scale our enterprise flywheel for growth. Carelon Services delivered robust growth in operating revenue and earnings in the quarter as we gained traction with external clients both through new business wins and the expansion of risk-based services to existing customers. For example, we recently secured a significant win with an existing Blue Cross Blue Shield partner and deployed new behavioral and medical benefit management services to state and third-party payer clients. These awards are a testament to the value we deliver and an affirmation of our strategy of proving value internally before driving growth externally. Turning to CarelonRx. We are integrating recent acquisitions and scaling key value drivers as we invest to control the levers that matter to deliver greater value and enhance consumer experiences for our members. Our margin performance in the second quarter reflects elevated investment, specifically around infrastructure and service levels as we remain committed to providing best-in-class home delivery and SpecialtyRx services. We see significant opportunity to grow and scale these assets and remain excited about the growth potential of CarelonRx. We are making progress on our enterprise strategy in 2024 to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our Health Benefits business and have robust long-term growth potential embedded in each of these imperatives. We are delivering strong and accelerating growth in Carelon Services with a long runway ahead. Meanwhile, our guidance for 2024 embeds significant investment in growth, notably in CarelonRx and government health plan operating margins below their long-term average with meaningful upside to our targets. Our focused execution reflects our confidence in Carelon as our flywheel for enterprise growth and the embedded earnings power of our businesses, which together will enable us to deliver strong growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the long-term. In closing, I want to thank our community partners who share our purpose and dedication as well as our associates who work hard every day to make Elevance Health a lifetime trusted health partner for the members we are privileged to serve. Their collective passion is reflecting a recent external recognition, including as one of America's Greatest Workplaces in 2024 by Newsweek where Elevance Health earned five out of five stars as well as our inclusion among the Best Companies to Work For for 2024 by US News and World Report. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Kaye, to discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. Mark?\nMark Kaye: Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail shared, we reported second quarter results, including GAAP diluted earnings per share of $9.85 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.12, representing growth of 12% year-over-year. We ended the second quarter with 45.8 million members, principally reflecting attrition in our Medicaid membership. Our commercial fee-based business grew by 354,000 lives year-over-year, reflecting the distinct value we provide to self-insured employers and the strength of the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand. Additionally, the thoughtful positioning of our individual ACA products has proven effective in ensuring robust and profitable growth. Total operating revenue for the quarter was $43.2 billion, approximately flat year-over-year. As we approach the tail-end of Medicaid redeterminations, we anticipate growing operating revenue in the second half of the year, driven by growth in premiums and CarelonRx product revenue related to higher external membership and the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare. Carelon Services' momentum accelerated in the quarter. Operating revenue grew by over 26% and operating earnings increased by more than 30% due to growth in risk-based services provided to internal and external clients, prudent pricing and strong execution. The consolidated benefit expense ratio was 86.3% for the second quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was driven by several factors including premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trends, disciplined medical management and a shift in our mix of business towards commercial. This was partially offset by our Medicaid business where acuity has increased due to attrition of healthier members. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2023. We absorbed elevated investment costs notably in CarelonRx and this along with other strategic initiatives will position our company for long-term sustainable growth. We anticipate significant improvement in our operating expense ratio in the second half of this year. Adjusted operating gain for the enterprise grew approximately 6% year-over-year, led by Carelon Services. We have maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable at the end of the second quarter stood at 45.3 days, above our long-term target range in the low 40s. As a reminder, days in claims payable in the first quarter included approximately 1.7 days related to the industry-wide delays in claims receipts. With respect to our outlook, we are closely monitoring acuity and cost trends, notably in Medicaid, and are working collaboratively with states to ensure rates remain actuarily sound. We are, however, expecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid and as a result, anticipate our full year benefit expense ratio will end the year in the upper half of our initial guidance range. Nonetheless, we expect to achieve our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of at least $37.20. Before I close, I'd like to briefly talk through our enterprise growth algorithm which we have included in the supplemental earnings presentation provided this morning. Our commitment to growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by at least 12% annually on average incorporates upper single-digit growth in operating revenue, underpinned by membership growth, geographic expansion and momentum in Carelon as we scale our enterprise flywheel. Our commitment to disciplined underwriting and operating expense management across all lines of business will drive the improvement inherent in our enterprise operating margin target of 6.5% to 7% by 2027. Taken together, we are targeting growing operating earnings in the upper single-digit to low double-digit percent range annually on average over time. Finally, we expect capital deployment to consistently deliver one-third of our targeted adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate. Overall, our results in the first half of the year are consistent with our initial guidance, and we will maintain a steadfast focus on execution and operating efficiency over the balance of the year. And with that, operator, please open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of A.J. Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\nA.J. Rice: Hi, everybody. Maybe just to kick it off here. I know you've laid out your long-term growth objectives and all. I wonder if at this early date, you're prepared to comment a little more on any plans you have to accelerate growth in '25. I know the topline has had redeterminations and other things this year. What's your thought about ability to get back to that growth trajectory that you're seeking long-term in '25?\nGail Boudreaux: Great. Thanks, A.J., and thanks very much for the question this morning. I think let me start with what Mark outlined as our enterprise growth algorithm because I think that really frames for everyone how we are thinking about our business. And also as you think about 2024 and our results, the balance and resilience of our complementary businesses that has allowed us to grow in multiple ways in many type of different macroeconomic environments. While it is early for '25, I'd like to at least frame sort of how we're thinking about 2025. We do expect to accelerate revenue growth across all of our businesses. Specifically in our health business, we see a lot of really strong momentum in commercial and that's been ongoing. Part of that's through the targeted expansion of our individual ACA footprint and in some cases, adding new geographies that help support what's happening in the Medicaid redeterminations. In Medicare Advantage, as we said in our opening comments, we feel that we've positioned ourselves for sustainable growth in margins and look at that as a very good long-term business. And then in Medicaid, we're nearing the end of the redetermination cycle and we do anticipate a return to growth. And you've heard about some of our early wins this year which we are very pleased with. We also do believe that some of those that were redetermined based on administrative reasons will be coming back, albeit it's taken a little bit longer than we originally thought. And then I'd like to kind of close these comments about our excitement around Carelon and the growth that we're seeing and how we progressed. You saw some of that come through in the second quarter. In Carelon Services, we are seeing some very strong external growth in the quarter and we see expanded opportunities as we continue to build our capabilities, particularly in the risk market. And what we're seeing here is our ability to prove it on our own businesses first and then take it to the market commercially has been a really strong selling point for us and we're very excited about that. And then finally, CarelonRx is our ability to scale, especially on the specialty side, including the integration of some of our recent capabilities such as Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy. And we're looking forward to adding the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business as well as we continue to diversify. So overall, as we think about acceleration of revenue growth in '25, we do expect it across all of our business and are extremely positive about what we're seeing inside of our business. So, thank you for the question. And next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask on Medicaid. I think about a quarter of your book is due to set rates in the back half of the year. Could you maybe just talk about what your guidance assumes for these rate updates? And maybe anything you've seen kind of so far as you think about the updates for July or October to the extent you have visibility? And I guess, Mark, on your comment on Medicaid utilization, have you seen the level of care on a same member basis increase or is the issue really just the timing dynamic between where state rates are and the level of acuity that you're seeing in your population?\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks for the questions, Nathan. A lot in there. So let me ask Felicia Norwood, who leads Government first and then have Mark respond to the second part of your question. Felicia?\nFelicia Norwood: So, good morning, Nathan. You are absolutely right. The way our rate timing works, we have about half of our states where we have rates in the first half of the year and the other half in the back half of the year with a -- our core group certainly in fourth quarter. At this point, we have visibility into nearly all of our Medicaid Premium for 2024 and the rate conversations with our states are very constructive. With that said, not all of our rates are final. We are in constant conversations with our states and providing them with information, updated information that we see in terms of the experience almost weekly to make sure that they are seeing what we are seeing from an overall change perspective as we wind down redeterminations which certainly has been one of the largest transformative things that have happened in Medicaid for some period of time. I will say that the conversations are ongoing. We fully expect our rates to remain actuarily sound, but we acknowledge the potential for a short-term disconnect between the timing of our rates and the emerging acuity in our populations and that's certainly been reflected in our updates for the year. I will say that we continue to make sure that states and their actuaries have the most recent data that we have and we will continue to have that engagement as we go through the fourth quarter rate process with a few very large states that remain in negotiations with us. And with that, I will turn it over to Mark to talk about the rest of the issues around utilization.\nMark Kaye: Thanks very much, Felicia, and good morning. Medicaid utilization in the quarter, as you heard from Felicia, reflected higher acuity as expected. We are also seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures. I just wanted to add here, just as we noted in our prepared remarks, the full year outlook does allow for both this shift in acuity and increased utilization in the second half of the year, including the rate timing mismatch that Felicia spoke to.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Yeah. Could you talk a little bit about CarelonRx, and in particular, interested in the contracting approach and scope for the CVS contract that underlies parts of that as you're insourcing things? And then just if you could give a quick update on the status of the integration rollout to the Anthem members and other members of BioPlus and Paragon and the status of Kroger? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Great. Well, thanks, Lance. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to address your question.\nPete Haytaian: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks a lot for the question, Lance. We feel very good about the overall strategy as it relates to pharmacy. I'll start with how we're performing on the core and growth in the core. Our strategy is resonating in the marketplace. There continues to be a lot of interest in what we're doing as it relates to the strategic levers that matter and how we're insourcing and diversifying our business. And I think our value story is really resonating -- the integrated value story and that's really playing through with highly competitive pricing. And again, we continue to perform very well on the core PBM down-market and middle-market. So we feel very good about that. As it relates to our diversification and your question on our assets, things are going very well. As we talked about with regard to specialty, we spent the last year building out our infrastructure to be able to handle the capacity -- to have the capacity to handle the Elevance scripts and we feel very good about that. We began to migrate scripts at the beginning of this year as it relates to specialty and we continue to move forward in that regard. And importantly, we are preparing right now and continue to make investments around the Kroger close and assuming those scripts as well. Right now, we're projecting that to close Q3, Q4 of this year and again, a lot of preparation and investment to make sure that we do that really well. And then finally, as it relates to Paragon, again, just to reiterate the opportunity there because we feel very, very good about that. We're talking about $16 billion of infusion spend as it relates to Elevance Health with about 50% of that being in the hospital setting. So again, a great opportunity for us to have care be provided in a more appropriate setting, be it in an ambulatory site or in the home and we feel very good about our positioning and the density that we have in our markets as it relates to that. And importantly, as part of that strategy, we are targeting at a zip code level, the stand-up of ambulatory sites to be able to provide that care. We're launching one imminently and then we are preparing and building out strategies to launch others into 2025. So, overall, we feel very good about our strategy of insourcing the strategic levers that matter and the growth opportunity that exists.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Pete, and thanks again, Lance, for the question. And just I think this is a great example of our flywheel for growth and our ability to scale these assets which we're very excited about. And again, thinking about this as the opportunity to drive a differentiated cost of care for our health plans within Elevance Health, but also better experience for members and support our partners across the ecosystem. So again, a really important part of our flywheel. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Okay, great. Thanks. I guess in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the results here were somewhat burdened by, I guess, three things. One, your investments in Carelon for growth and then you had below average margins in Medicaid and below average margins in Medicare Advantage. Can you help size those things? How should we think about where those margins are today relative to kind of where they should be from a target perspective? Thanks.\nMark Kaye: Thanks very much for the question. We're not going to comment on in detail where single lines business operating margin may land, given our combined Health Benefits reporting segment. But however, to your question, let me give you a little bit of color. We do expect the Medicaid margins to compress year-over-year. There are key factors driving this, including or beyond the industry-wide dynamics that we're navigating. And those include what we spoke to a moment ago around the timing mismatch of rates relative to acuity and the higher acuity itself associated with the Medicaid membership mix. Importantly, as you heard us talk to you just a moment ago, we are holding very constructive conversations with the states to ensure those rates remain actuarily sound. In Medicare, we do continue to expect margins are going to improve in 2024 compared to 2023. They will still remain below our long-term target margin range. And then finally, we are very pleased with the progress of our 2024 commercial repricing initiatives and our disciplined pricing practices. And we've spoken about this before, but it's worth emphasizing 2023 really marked that first -- or the end of that first full year of our efforts to recover margins and you're seeing some of that benefit together with the action that we're taking in 2024 come through our numbers.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. What are your expectations for market-level growth in MA for 2025? And I know it's early, but maybe any headwinds, tailwinds and how we should expect Elevance to grow market-share relative to the overall market in MA for 2025?\nGail Boudreaux: I'll ask Felicia to comment on that, Josh. Thank you.\nFelicia Norwood: So, good morning, Josh, and thank you. It's an incredibly dynamic time in Medicare Advantage. And now more than ever, we think it's important to be very thoughtful and rational as we plan for 2025. Despite this environment, Medicare Advantage enrollment is at an all-time high and over 50% of individuals are still choosing MA. And that means there's still a clear value for what MA offers and we're committed in the long-term to having and operating a profitable and sustainable MA business. It's a little early to talk about 2025 in terms of growth expectations. Our bids were recently submitted to CMS and frankly, we are still getting feedback on that. In addition to that, the industry-wide submissions aren't known yet. We feel encouraged by commentary from peers that everybody is going to kind of price rationally and have benefit rationalization as we head into 2025, but we still have to wait and see what emerges once we have greater information from our competitors. So at this point, there's a lot of unknowns. I will tell you we maintained a very disciplined approach, offering competitive benefits while we are balancing growth and margins. I think we were very thoughtful in the plan designs that we put out there to make sure that we were focusing on profitable growth and the sustainability of this program for the long term. We are very focused on our DSNP business, which is where we believe that we have a strong advantage when we think about our Medicaid and Medicare positioning. And we also did prioritization around our products in terms of our local market dynamics. So it's still early to determine what growth is going to look like for 2025. We feel very good about how we position our business on the heels of our strategy in 2024 to make sure that we have a sustainable long-term business in Medicare Advantage. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Thanks very much and good morning. I really want to stick with Medicare Advantage for a minute. Can you talk about what you saw specifically in the quarter around trend? And then, Felicia, maybe you can comment on what you included around trend assumption in your MA bids as we think about 2025?\nGail Boudreaux: Great. I'll ask Mark to comment on your question.\nMark Kaye: Thanks very much for the additional questions here on Medicaid. First, we are seeing a larger than typical pull-forward effect and that's really driven by the increased numbers of Medicaid members who are losing coverage. You can think about this as beneficiaries who are facing an imminent loss of coverage, in the month or so preceding that coverage loss, picking up additional benefits. Second, member mischaracterization among the core expansion in specialized population has caused some localized revenue pressure as some members expect to regain coverage after previously being determined as ineligible. And third, on this topic of Medicaid, elevated outpatient trends in elective procedures. Steve just flagged me, he said to talk about Medicare. So I apologize for that. On Medicare, the answer is very short. Trends developed in line with expectations.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Mark. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Appreciate the question. First, can you size the Medicaid trend increase that you're seeing here? And then second, I just wanted to follow up on Kevin's question on government margins. Understand you don't want to give us specific absolute margin levels, but I was wondering if you could share your expectation of the trajectory of margins in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid for 2025 versus 2024? Thanks.\nMark Kaye: Thanks very much for the question. Segment margins in the quarter improved by 20 basis points year-over-year. And I'd argue that the first half results here are consistent with our initial guidance range. And we expect full year margins to end within our initial outlook, up 25 basis points to 50 basis points, primarily driven by the ongoing recovery of our Commercial business. From a seasonality perspective, there are two key comments I wanted to draw out here. For modeling purposes, second quarter revenue growth is going to mark the low point for the year and we expect third and fourth quarter operating revenue and premium revenue growth rates to improve. And then secondly, just on the MLR that ties directly to your question, we now expect the third quarter MLR to be near the high end of our full year guidance range. And I note this specifically, Justin, as the current third quarter consensus estimate does not appear to capture the calendar day shift associated with the Leap year and that's going to have approximately a 70 basis point impact on the third quarter MLR.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a little bit about the investments you're making around CarelonRx and how you're thinking about the timeline in terms of scaling specialty? And are there ample opportunities out there for you like Kroger and Paragon out there? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thanks. Thanks, Erin, and welcome to our call. I think this is the first time you've been on our call. So it's great to hear from you. I'll ask Pete to comment.\nPete Haytaian: Yeah, no, thank you. We feel very good about our specialty strategy, and I appreciate the question. I'll try not to repeat what I said before and give you a little bit more context. But as I noted, as it related to our specialty strategy, we acquired BioPlus last year in 2023. And again, we spent a lot of time last year in building out the infrastructure and the capacity to be able to assume Elevance scripts. And our focus as it relates to the near term is being able to migrate Elevance scripts, which will occur through this year and into 2025. As you noted, we're going to be opportunistic and we have been as it relates to things like Kroger, that provides additional scale for us. To give you a little bit of color on Kroger, it's about 500,000 incremental scripts. They also give us access to additional LDDs as well as having a presence in places like Puerto Rico, which could help us as well. And so we'll continue to be opportunistic as it relates to our specialty strategy and really on our focus to deliver whole health. We are anticipating, as I noted earlier, that Kroger would close Q3, Q4 of this year, and we're preparing for that and continuing to make investments around that. And then I'd say as we move forward more broadly and Gail touched upon this as it relates to our specialty strategy, there's a real focus on patient differentiation in Whole Health. We have a wonderful opportunity as we move forward to really drive Whole Health and capture all the value of Carelon, including things like integrating behavioral health and other services. And so that's going to be our goals and focus moving forward. We feel very bullish about it. We feel very bullish about our growth. We feel very bullish about delivering on the Carelon strategy and Whole Health as we move forward.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please. Thank you, Pete.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Ha from Baird. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ha: Thank you. Just wanted to ask about your long-term growth targets. In your deck, you now had a slight decline in health benefits long term growth CAGR. And apologies if I missed this in your comments, but could you provide some color on what's driving that? Is that MA, Medicaid, presumably not Commercial? And then I also think you reaffirmed long term targets on Carelon. But over the past year since your Investor Day, CD&R partnership, BioPlus, acquisition of Paragon, pending Kroger, the business seemingly has taken very positive steps forward in its evolution. So would it be fair to say your prior targets at Investor Day, most of those assumptions within your guide or long-term targets did not contemplate all these new developments. And specifically, Carelon Services revenue per consumer serve the 50% growth target by '27 now appears like there's much, much higher runway. So just overall taking a step back, even though you're reaffirming your targets. Is it true that now today, there's significantly greater potential embedded earnings power within Carelon versus last year that could be unlocked in future years? Thank you.\nMark Kaye: This quarter, we are pleased to introduce our growth algorithm which underpins our adjusted diluted earnings per share target of average annual growth of at least 12% over time. You asked a little bit about the revision, and we have revised our enterprise revenue growth target from the high single to low double-digits to high single-digits percent range and that's primarily to reflect Medicaid-related attrition that has occurred to date and the impact of the prudent actions that we're taking in our 2024 and 2025 Medicare Advantage bids in response to the risk model revisions. Accordingly, our health benefits segment revenue CAGR should now be in the -- will now be in the mid-to-upper single-digit percent range. But the key point here is our path is much the same. And that really means that we're expecting high-single-digit to low double-digit percent growth in operating earnings. And the key point here to the second half of your question, with approximately one-third contribution from capital deployment and that capital deployment can come through in the form of inorganic activity to support our Carelon businesses. Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Mok: Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow-up on some of the Medicaid comments. It sounds like you're optimistic that rates get better in the back half, but also acknowledge a temporary disconnect that persists and expect higher Medicaid utilization in the back half. So if we translate that into MLR expectations, does guidance assume that Medicaid MLR peaks in 2Q and gets better from here with potentially better rates or do you expect it to peak at some point in the back half of the year? Thanks.\nMark Kaye: Great question. And the opening comments there are completely consistent with the way that we're thinking about it. You should really think about this as we now expect our full year benefit expense ratio to be in the upper half of that initial guidance range, i.e., 87% to 87.5%, principally because of the Medicaid dynamics that we're navigating. We're not looking to provide specific quarter-by-quarter guidance.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ryan Langston from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nRyan Langston: Hi, good morning. Just a quick one for me. Prior year development was a bit more favorable than we expected. Can you maybe give us a sense on if that's just mostly from the fourth quarter, and if so, any kind of particular pockets of utilization you'd call out is maybe coming in better than expected? Thanks.\nMark Kaye: Thanks very much for the question. Let me put the prior development in the context of the medical claims payment change this quarter. I think that's more instructive to understand the dynamics here. And you saw medical claims payable in the quarter go down by approximately $1.3 billion versus the first quarter. And there are really several factors that drove this and then ultimately drove PYD development. And they include the reserve runoff due to Medicaid membership decline, the catch-up in claims paid associated with elevated reserves for industry-wide claim receipt delays in the first quarter, and then the improved operational environment that's reflected through our shorter cycle times. And the key point here is that MCP, which is why it's more instructive, remains at historically high levels, both in aggregate and on a fully insured PMPM basis. And that indicates the continuity of our historical prudent reserving practices and our strong balance sheet.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Mark. And, Ryan, welcome to our call for the first time. It's great to have you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to come back to the Medicaid utilization comments, I think you were making in response to an earlier question. I'd love to expand a little bit on that. Could you comment perhaps on how much of the pressure is geographically isolated in some of your markets versus maybe more broad-based? I think you're speaking to also some utilization of care from people that were expecting to lose coverage. Would you be expecting that dynamic to slow a little bit as redeterminations end, or is that potentially offset by rejoiner dynamics or factors like that? Thank you.\nMark Kaye: Thanks for the question and appreciate the opportunity to provide additional clarification here. Certainly, we expect the larger than typical pull-forward effect that we've seen in the second quarter to abate as the year goes on, principally because we're through the tail end of redeterminations at this point. We are obviously working with the states to ensure that the timing and rate mismatch is appropriately adjusted. On the member miscategorization, this is really ensuring that those members who are initially categorized, for example as TANF are put in the more appropriate and -- cohort for purposes of rates to think about ABD, for example. And then what we are really seeing elevate as the year goes on is the outpatient trains and elective procedures, and that's something that we fully accounted for in our MLR guide for the full year.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could drill a bit more into the $4.3 billion of timing items that impacted operating cash flow. And then just wanted to see whether you expect all those to reverse in the back half of the year and whether you're comfortable reaffirming your full year CFFO target of at least $8.1 billion and if not, where you expect operating cash flow to land for the year. Thanks.\nMark Kaye: Appreciate the question this morning. Year to date, operating cash flow is $2.4 billion and to your point, that is a decrease of approximately $6 billion year-over-year. The key point here is that this includes $4.3 billion of timing-related items and approximately $1.3 billion of net cash outflows that are primarily associated with the runoff of our Medicaid reserves and the improvement in the operational environment, which is reflected by a short -- shorter cycle times. The timing-related item reflects a $3.6 billion impact from an additional month of premiums that we received from CMS in the year ago period, and so not a concern from our perspective. On a full year basis, we do expect operating cash flow outlook to be slightly north of $7 billion, and that really reflects the year-to-date reductions in working capital and specifically, as I mentioned a moment ago, that decrease in MCP driven by Medicaid membership attrition.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. So in the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned a significant win with a Blue Cross Blue Shield partner. I was wondering if you can help us size your pipeline there and give us any clarity on how penetrated you are into that market. So how many of your Blues brethren do you currently have contracts with and what's the opportunity look like to expand this?\nGail Boudreaux: Great. Thanks, Sarah. Pete?\nPete Haytaian: Yes, Sarah, thanks a lot for the question. Appreciate it. And yeah, we're really pleased with how services growth is going. We mentioned 26% growth in the quarter and a clear path of achieving our long term objectives. So we feel very good about that. As it relates to your question, again, our focus is, as Gail said earlier, building capabilities internally and importing them externally, and we're seeing that play through. And your reference to Blues, I would say that we are currently engaged with most of the Blues, and our strategy with regard to that is really landing and expanding, to be quite frank. And this is a great example of that where we had an existing relationship with a client, we continue to grow those services with that particular Blue. They see the value in that. We were able to convert some of those capabilities to risk. And I'll remind you that, that is a very big part of our strategy, assumption of risk, both on a category of service basis as well as a full risk basis. And so, you'll see that continue to move forward. As it relates to the pipeline, this year, we're doing very well. '24 growth year-over-year is very, very strong. So you'll see really nice improvement from that perspective. And as you would expect, we're already selling into 2025. A real focus in 2025 on our behavioral health capabilities, our post-acute capabilities and then some of our Carelon Health businesses. So I appreciate the question, Sarah.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah. Thanks, Pete. Thanks for the question, Sarah. As you heard from Pete, it's an -- we have exciting opportunities to deepen our penetration because we do work with most of the Blues -- other Blues today and also other payers, quite frankly, and state partners has been a great opportunity for Carelon more broadly and you're seeing that come through. So thanks for the question. We're excited about the opportunity there. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys. And I appreciate you taking the question. I guess, Mark, I was just going to ask if you could bridge a little bit when we think about the 2027 OP margin targets in the MCO segments. Kind of like how you think about the sources of the margin expansion there. And I'd be interested in particular if you would talk about what your expectations are around the exchange subsidies and the growth of the exchange business.\nMark Kaye: Thank you very much for the question, George, and certainly happy to talk through the algorithm at a little bit of a high level. So you can think about this as being driven by upper single-digit growth in revenue, enterprise operating margin expansion to 6.5% to 7%, and then the balanced approach to capital deployment, inclusive of share repurchases and strategic M&A. On the revenue side, revenue growth is going to be driven by increased membership in the health benefits business, geographic expansion efforts, and then prudent pricing to cover cost trend. And then similarly in Carelon, key drivers are going to include the expansion of risk-based revenue in Carelon Services and the continued growth in CarelonRx membership. On the margin side, expansion is going to reflect the disciplined operating expense management and the transformation of some of our business processes, leveraging new technologies, including AI. And that coupled together with -- or at least the way I think about it, effective medical management and underwriting disciplines really going to enable us to achieve the enterprise operating margin target. And then finally, consistent with our 2023 Investor Day guidance, we do expect to achieve approximately a third of our adjusted diluted EPS growth rate through capital deployments.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Mark. And to your second part of the question around our exchange business, as you have heard us talk about, we have been, I think, very disciplined in our approach to expanding that business. We have had very strong results individually, up 30% -- 35% year-over-year with the ACA growing almost 40%. So as you think about that, our goal is to serve our members throughout their coverage transitions. We see a significant opportunity to continue that expansion, including geographic expansion, particularly for members that were historically in Medicaid and now need other coverage. So, again, a really nice opportunity. But you'll see that same sort of disciplined approach that we've shown throughout in the ACA. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: All right. Hey, thanks. Just quickly, on midyear renewals, just remind us how much of the commercial risk book renews in the second half of this year and just how you're thinking about retention, membership, ability to take the required price action that you need. And just as a clarification, is it fair that Commercial is performing better than expectations on margin with government, worse, at least in the first half? I just wanted to make sure I properly got this. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: All right. Thank you. I'm going to have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our Commercial Business, address your questions.\nMorgan Kendrick: Yeah. Thanks for the question. As we think about it, that cohort of business that we renew in July is about 25% of the risk-based large group business. And to camp onto that, it performed as expected. In fact, we're seeing persistency up a bit. We talked about attrition in the large group risk business with our January cohort on the first quarter call, That's abated and we're seeing persistency improve, and we're seeing the margins coming through. So we feel really good about how we're positioned for continued growth and expansion in that business moving forward.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Thanks for taking my question. I believe you have a cost savings plan targeting around $750 million. That's maybe a relatively nearer term initiative. I'm wondering if you could describe your progress against that. And then also, should we think about the benefits of those savings dropping through? Or are you mostly reinvesting those savings in some of your growth initiatives? Thank you.\nMark Kaye: Dave, good morning. Thanks very much for the question. In terms of the 2023 business optimization activity, we are on track to realize the gross run rate expense efficiency improvement of approximately $750 million that we committed to do. And that's going to benefit both our operating performance this year and it's going to help to establish the strong foundation for growth in 2025 and beyond. If I step back just for a moment, and we covered this a bit in our prepared remarks, we do anticipate significant improvement in our operating expense ratio in the second half of the year as we continue to take additional steps to enhance operational efficiency, and we'll begin to see and realize those incremental run rate improvements over time.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Mark. And Dave, I might maybe just spend a moment because I think it's a great opportunity to share a little bit about how we're going about this. We, first of all, have been very disciplined about our expense management. More importantly, we believe the opportunity around Generative AI for our business is expansive and it's going to materially impact all parts of our organization. We've been focusing on a couple of things, and I know I've spoken about this before, enhancing experiences while driving costs down, but also fueling future expansion. And I would say over the last few months we've really accelerated those internal efforts. And again, this has been a journey. So it's not new, but we are going to start seeing the absolute impact of the AI technology and digitization around our significant operational areas. And just a couple of things maybe to make this real as we transform. And there's kind of three areas around the engagement model that we think about members, providers and our own associates who are critical to this journey with us. On the member side, we look at each interactions of our members and we're using AI to make those much more unique and personalized and integrating it across our member touchpoints. Oftentimes there's disconnects in those touch points and that's a huge opportunity for us to take really personalized digital service and enrich that experience. And what does that do? I mean, the real impact you see it is improved access to care, better times processing, less error rates, reduction of our calls, use of chat. So those are some very tangible ways that we're deploying that and have been over the last year. And you're going to start seeing that come through based on what Mark just shared. The provider side is an area that I'm particularly excited about because we're looking at reimagining and streamlining all of our admin tax -- tasks rather on an end-to-end basis with the provider lifecycle. And that's a lot. But as you think about the impacts there, we touch not just providers but also members and some very specific things like automating the onboarding process of how they come into our plans, refining roster management specifically around data and how that drives downstream to claims, also enhancing contract administration. And we think those interactions are going to improve our member experiences, but also improve our relationship and our ability to work in value-based care with our care providers and more seamlessly. And then I'll end with associates because we know that they need to be part of this journey. It's also a cultural journey on AI that's going to drive, I think, greater efficiency. And we rolled out our spark, which is our internal ChatGPT tool to over 50,000 of our associates so that they can harness the capability, use it and improve their own productivity. And we're seeing really nice results from that. So again, I wanted to just share that because I think our expense, focus and efficiency is driven a lot by the impact we're going to see from that. And while we have a lot of opportunities, we're trying to look at the end-to-end impact of where we can take friction out of the system and fundamentally improve what we're doing. So hopefully that gives you a sense of how we're going about achieving the goals that we set, and we see huge opportunities going forward and embedded into our growth algorithm for the future. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nAnn Hynes: Hi, good morning. I just want to focus on Specialty. I know that Elevance is -- with your acquisitions, you're insourcing more specialty, not only on the dispensary side but also the distribution side. So I'm just curious about your strategy longer term. Do you think there's more opportunity for specialty on the distribution side? And if you think there is, is there any therapeutic area you're focused on? Thanks.\nPete Haytaian: Thanks for the question, Ann. We think there's a tremendous opportunity as it relates to specialties. I said, earlier, our priority in the near term is the Elevance scripts, and absorbing the Elevance scripts effectively. And then also, as we talked about what we're doing with Kroger. We continue to see opportunities to cover more LDDs. And then in addition to that, as it relates to Whole Health, we are very focused on the patient experience. We are very focused on centers of excellence and how we can care for the members in a differentiated way by wrapping around additional assets. Longer term, again, we will be opportunistic, but right now, we have a lot in front of us and we want to execute against that effectively as it relates to specialty.\nGail Boudreaux: Yes. Thanks, Pete. And Ann, I just want to highlight one point that Pete said, it's really an integration strategy. Specialty has a long runway for us, but the integration to our Carelon Services and what we do to deliver better value for our health plan members is really critical to our strategy. And I think that is unique, our ability to take both the Specialty pharmacy, but all the Specialty services around these disease categories we think is differentiating. So, thank you. Last question we're going to take now, please.\nOperator: For our final question, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted a quick follow-up on Felicia's comments on MA bids for next year. I realize it's too early to talk about growth, but I think earlier in the year, you had talked about long term MA growth focused toward Carelon markets. And I just wanted to see if you could provide any color on how your bids contemplate your geographic footprint evolving and also your density towards Carelon markets in 2025. Thanks.\nFelicia Norwood: So, Ben, thank you for the question. We've always been very strategic around where we want to see our MA growth as we go forward. If you recall this past year, we made very deliberate decisions around markets that we wanted to exit because we wanted to make sure that we positioned ourselves to long term growth and performance. When we think about our strategy today, it's certainly in those areas where we have Medicare and Medicaid business, because the DSNP business is incredibly important for us. And if you think about where things are going long term, having alignment around Medicare and Medicaid is critical for us. But ultimately, it's absolutely about being able to deliver for the Carelon flywheel as well. The members that we are focused on, particularly in D-SNP and other SNP products, are very complex populations. And as we think about Whole Health, we've been working very collaboratively with Pete and the team to make sure that we are able to deliver Whole Health for those that we are very privileged to serve. So the footprint really is focused on density, certainly in our Blue markets, but being able to be focused on our Medicaid markets as well, in places where we see opportunities to grow strategically with Carelon in the future. And that's the pathway and framework that we've established when we think about the long term growth for our Medicare Advantage business which we continue to be incredibly excited about as we think about being a lifetime trusted partner for those we serve. So thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: So, thank you for your questions, everyone, and thank you for all of you for joining us today, for your interest and your support. We look forward to sharing more about our progress that we're making on our enterprise strategy with you in the coming quarters and are confident that the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through August 17th, 2024.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's earnings call. This morning, we reported second quarter results, including adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.12, reflecting 12% growth year-on-year. These results reflect thoughtful execution in a dynamic operating environment as well as the unique strengths of our enterprise, including the power of our diverse set of businesses. We have reaffirmed our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of at least $37.20, which represents 12% growth year-over-year. We have prudently maintained our full year outlook, given industry-wide dynamics we are navigating in our Medicaid business and the investments we are making to support business transformation and deepen capabilities within CarelonRx. Our Health Benefits segment demonstrated balance and resilience in the quarter. In Commercial, we continue to make progress on our margin recovery initiative and are delivering solid membership growth, notably in our individual ACA business which has grown substantially year-over-year. We've also extended our momentum in national accounts where the business is tracking to historically high retention levels and new customer acquisition remains strong. Year-to-date, we've consolidated business with additional existing employer group clients who previously only worked with us on a slice of their business, a testament to the unique value we deliver to the market. In Medicaid, we are pleased with our recent new business wins and re-procurement success, positioning us for future growth. We launched the Indiana Pathways for Aging program just weeks ago and are proud to be the largest payer in this important program in our home state, serving nearly 40% of all eligible Hoosiers. Indiana Pathways plays directly to our strengths, serving populations with chronic and complex needs. We were also privileged to be awarded the KanCare Kansas Medicaid RFP this quarter, working in partnership alongside two Blue partners as Healthy Blue. Turning to Medicaid redeterminations. While nearly all of our members have had their eligibility redetermined since the process resumed last year, our work is not done. With approximately 70% of coverage losses attributable to administrative challenges, we continue our proactive outreach to members to maximize access to care and minimize barriers to whole health. We expect disenrolled members to re-enroll throughout the year, albeit on a longer lag than expected when redeterminations resumed last year, We are seeing the percentage of returners steadily increase, especially in our Blue states where we offer both Commercial and Medicaid health plans. As a result of redeterminations, our Medicaid membership mix has shifted, resulting in increased acuity and we are working actively with our state partners to ensure rates remain actuarily sound. In Medicare, we were pleased with the recent ruling regarding our challenge of the initial 2024 Star ratings. As a result, our enterprise weighted-average rating has increased to 4.0 Star and we now expect approximately 56% of our members will be in plans rated at least 4.0 Star or in contracts too new to be rated that will be reimbursed similarly in payment year 2025. This outcome will help offset funding cuts to the Medicare Advantage program for the second consecutive year, which we believe will result in increased premiums and/or reduced benefits for seniors and people with disabilities who rely on Medicare Advantage for their health and wellbeing. For our part, we maintained our disciplined approach to 2025 bids. We will be offering highly valued and competitive benefits as we seek to balance growth and margins and remain focused on building an attractive and sustainable Medicare Advantage business for the long term. In our Health Services businesses, we are making progress on our key strategic priority to scale our enterprise flywheel for growth. Carelon Services delivered robust growth in operating revenue and earnings in the quarter as we gained traction with external clients both through new business wins and the expansion of risk-based services to existing customers. For example, we recently secured a significant win with an existing Blue Cross Blue Shield partner and deployed new behavioral and medical benefit management services to state and third-party payer clients. These awards are a testament to the value we deliver and an affirmation of our strategy of proving value internally before driving growth externally. Turning to CarelonRx. We are integrating recent acquisitions and scaling key value drivers as we invest to control the levers that matter to deliver greater value and enhance consumer experiences for our members. Our margin performance in the second quarter reflects elevated investment, specifically around infrastructure and service levels as we remain committed to providing best-in-class home delivery and SpecialtyRx services. We see significant opportunity to grow and scale these assets and remain excited about the growth potential of CarelonRx. We are making progress on our enterprise strategy in 2024 to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high-growth opportunities and optimize our Health Benefits business and have robust long-term growth potential embedded in each of these imperatives. We are delivering strong and accelerating growth in Carelon Services with a long runway ahead. Meanwhile, our guidance for 2024 embeds significant investment in growth, notably in CarelonRx and government health plan operating margins below their long-term average with meaningful upside to our targets. Our focused execution reflects our confidence in Carelon as our flywheel for enterprise growth and the embedded earnings power of our businesses, which together will enable us to deliver strong growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over the long-term. In closing, I want to thank our community partners who share our purpose and dedication as well as our associates who work hard every day to make Elevance Health a lifetime trusted health partner for the members we are privileged to serve. Their collective passion is reflecting a recent external recognition, including as one of America's Greatest Workplaces in 2024 by Newsweek where Elevance Health earned five out of five stars as well as our inclusion among the Best Companies to Work For for 2024 by US News and World Report. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Kaye, to discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. Mark? Great. Thanks, A.J., and thanks very much for the question this morning. I think let me start with what Mark outlined as our enterprise growth algorithm because I think that really frames for everyone how we are thinking about our business. And also as you think about 2024 and our results, the balance and resilience of our complementary businesses that has allowed us to grow in multiple ways in many type of different macroeconomic environments. While it is early for '25, I'd like to at least frame sort of how we're thinking about 2025. We do expect to accelerate revenue growth across all of our businesses. Specifically in our health business, we see a lot of really strong momentum in commercial and that's been ongoing. Part of that's through the targeted expansion of our individual ACA footprint and in some cases, adding new geographies that help support what's happening in the Medicaid redeterminations. In Medicare Advantage, as we said in our opening comments, we feel that we've positioned ourselves for sustainable growth in margins and look at that as a very good long-term business. And then in Medicaid, we're nearing the end of the redetermination cycle and we do anticipate a return to growth. And you've heard about some of our early wins this year which we are very pleased with. We also do believe that some of those that were redetermined based on administrative reasons will be coming back, albeit it's taken a little bit longer than we originally thought. And then I'd like to kind of close these comments about our excitement around Carelon and the growth that we're seeing and how we progressed. You saw some of that come through in the second quarter. In Carelon Services, we are seeing some very strong external growth in the quarter and we see expanded opportunities as we continue to build our capabilities, particularly in the risk market. And what we're seeing here is our ability to prove it on our own businesses first and then take it to the market commercially has been a really strong selling point for us and we're very excited about that. And then finally, CarelonRx is our ability to scale, especially on the specialty side, including the integration of some of our recent capabilities such as Paragon Healthcare, BioPlus Specialty Pharmacy. And we're looking forward to adding the Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business as well as we continue to diversify. So overall, as we think about acceleration of revenue growth in '25, we do expect it across all of our business and are extremely positive about what we're seeing inside of our business. So, thank you for the question. And next question, please. Well, thanks for the questions, Nathan. A lot in there. So let me ask Felicia Norwood, who leads Government first and then have Mark respond to the second part of your question. Felicia? Thank you. Next question, please. Great. Well, thanks, Lance. I'm going to ask Pete Haytaian, who leads Carelon to address your question. Thanks, Pete, and thanks again, Lance, for the question. And just I think this is a great example of our flywheel for growth and our ability to scale these assets which we're very excited about. And again, thinking about this as the opportunity to drive a differentiated cost of care for our health plans within Elevance Health, but also better experience for members and support our partners across the ecosystem. So again, a really important part of our flywheel. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question, please. I'll ask Felicia to comment on that, Josh. Thank you. Next question, please. Great. I'll ask Mark to comment on your question. Thank you, Mark. Next question, please. Thank you. Next question, please. Well, thanks. Thanks, Erin, and welcome to our call. I think this is the first time you've been on our call. So it's great to hear from you. I'll ask Pete to comment. Next question, please. Thank you, Pete. Next question, please. Next question, please. Thank you, Mark. And, Ryan, welcome to our call for the first time. It's great to have you. Next question, please. Next question, please. Next question, please. Great. Thanks, Sarah. Pete? Yeah. Thanks, Pete. Thanks for the question, Sarah. As you heard from Pete, it's an -- we have exciting opportunities to deepen our penetration because we do work with most of the Blues -- other Blues today and also other payers, quite frankly, and state partners has been a great opportunity for Carelon more broadly and you're seeing that come through. So thanks for the question. We're excited about the opportunity there. Next question, please. Thank you, Mark. And to your second part of the question around our exchange business, as you have heard us talk about, we have been, I think, very disciplined in our approach to expanding that business. We have had very strong results individually, up 30% -- 35% year-over-year with the ACA growing almost 40%. So as you think about that, our goal is to serve our members throughout their coverage transitions. We see a significant opportunity to continue that expansion, including geographic expansion, particularly for members that were historically in Medicaid and now need other coverage. So, again, a really nice opportunity. But you'll see that same sort of disciplined approach that we've shown throughout in the ACA. Next question, please. All right. Thank you. I'm going to have Morgan Kendrick, who leads our Commercial Business, address your questions. Next question, please. Thank you, Mark. And Dave, I might maybe just spend a moment because I think it's a great opportunity to share a little bit about how we're going about this. We, first of all, have been very disciplined about our expense management. More importantly, we believe the opportunity around Generative AI for our business is expansive and it's going to materially impact all parts of our organization. We've been focusing on a couple of things, and I know I've spoken about this before, enhancing experiences while driving costs down, but also fueling future expansion. And I would say over the last few months we've really accelerated those internal efforts. And again, this has been a journey. So it's not new, but we are going to start seeing the absolute impact of the AI technology and digitization around our significant operational areas. And just a couple of things maybe to make this real as we transform. And there's kind of three areas around the engagement model that we think about members, providers and our own associates who are critical to this journey with us. On the member side, we look at each interactions of our members and we're using AI to make those much more unique and personalized and integrating it across our member touchpoints. Oftentimes there's disconnects in those touch points and that's a huge opportunity for us to take really personalized digital service and enrich that experience. And what does that do? I mean, the real impact you see it is improved access to care, better times processing, less error rates, reduction of our calls, use of chat. So those are some very tangible ways that we're deploying that and have been over the last year. And you're going to start seeing that come through based on what Mark just shared. The provider side is an area that I'm particularly excited about because we're looking at reimagining and streamlining all of our admin tax -- tasks rather on an end-to-end basis with the provider lifecycle. And that's a lot. But as you think about the impacts there, we touch not just providers but also members and some very specific things like automating the onboarding process of how they come into our plans, refining roster management specifically around data and how that drives downstream to claims, also enhancing contract administration. And we think those interactions are going to improve our member experiences, but also improve our relationship and our ability to work in value-based care with our care providers and more seamlessly. And then I'll end with associates because we know that they need to be part of this journey. It's also a cultural journey on AI that's going to drive, I think, greater efficiency. And we rolled out our spark, which is our internal ChatGPT tool to over 50,000 of our associates so that they can harness the capability, use it and improve their own productivity. And we're seeing really nice results from that. So again, I wanted to just share that because I think our expense, focus and efficiency is driven a lot by the impact we're going to see from that. And while we have a lot of opportunities, we're trying to look at the end-to-end impact of where we can take friction out of the system and fundamentally improve what we're doing. So hopefully that gives you a sense of how we're going about achieving the goals that we set, and we see huge opportunities going forward and embedded into our growth algorithm for the future. Next question, please. Yes. Thanks, Pete. And Ann, I just want to highlight one point that Pete said, it's really an integration strategy. Specialty has a long runway for us, but the integration to our Carelon Services and what we do to deliver better value for our health plan members is really critical to our strategy. And I think that is unique, our ability to take both the Specialty pharmacy, but all the Specialty services around these disease categories we think is differentiating. So, thank you. Last question we're going to take now, please. So, thank you for your questions, everyone, and thank you for all of you for joining us today, for your interest and your support. We look forward to sharing more about our progress that we're making on our enterprise strategy with you in the coming quarters and are confident that the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health, and have a great rest of your week."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "So, good morning, Nathan. You are absolutely right. The way our rate timing works, we have about half of our states where we have rates in the first half of the year and the other half in the back half of the year with a -- our core group certainly in fourth quarter. At this point, we have visibility into nearly all of our Medicaid Premium for 2024 and the rate conversations with our states are very constructive. With that said, not all of our rates are final. We are in constant conversations with our states and providing them with information, updated information that we see in terms of the experience almost weekly to make sure that they are seeing what we are seeing from an overall change perspective as we wind down redeterminations which certainly has been one of the largest transformative things that have happened in Medicaid for some period of time. I will say that the conversations are ongoing. We fully expect our rates to remain actuarily sound, but we acknowledge the potential for a short-term disconnect between the timing of our rates and the emerging acuity in our populations and that's certainly been reflected in our updates for the year. I will say that we continue to make sure that states and their actuaries have the most recent data that we have and we will continue to have that engagement as we go through the fourth quarter rate process with a few very large states that remain in negotiations with us. And with that, I will turn it over to Mark to talk about the rest of the issues around utilization. So, good morning, Josh, and thank you. It's an incredibly dynamic time in Medicare Advantage. And now more than ever, we think it's important to be very thoughtful and rational as we plan for 2025. Despite this environment, Medicare Advantage enrollment is at an all-time high and over 50% of individuals are still choosing MA. And that means there's still a clear value for what MA offers and we're committed in the long-term to having and operating a profitable and sustainable MA business. It's a little early to talk about 2025 in terms of growth expectations. Our bids were recently submitted to CMS and frankly, we are still getting feedback on that. In addition to that, the industry-wide submissions aren't known yet. We feel encouraged by commentary from peers that everybody is going to kind of price rationally and have benefit rationalization as we head into 2025, but we still have to wait and see what emerges once we have greater information from our competitors. So at this point, there's a lot of unknowns. I will tell you we maintained a very disciplined approach, offering competitive benefits while we are balancing growth and margins. I think we were very thoughtful in the plan designs that we put out there to make sure that we were focusing on profitable growth and the sustainability of this program for the long term. We are very focused on our DSNP business, which is where we believe that we have a strong advantage when we think about our Medicaid and Medicare positioning. And we also did prioritization around our products in terms of our local market dynamics. So it's still early to determine what growth is going to look like for 2025. We feel very good about how we position our business on the heels of our strategy in 2024 to make sure that we have a sustainable long-term business in Medicare Advantage. Thank you. So, Ben, thank you for the question. We've always been very strategic around where we want to see our MA growth as we go forward. If you recall this past year, we made very deliberate decisions around markets that we wanted to exit because we wanted to make sure that we positioned ourselves to long term growth and performance. When we think about our strategy today, it's certainly in those areas where we have Medicare and Medicaid business, because the DSNP business is incredibly important for us. And if you think about where things are going long term, having alignment around Medicare and Medicaid is critical for us. But ultimately, it's absolutely about being able to deliver for the Carelon flywheel as well. The members that we are focused on, particularly in D-SNP and other SNP products, are very complex populations. And as we think about Whole Health, we've been working very collaboratively with Pete and the team to make sure that we are able to deliver Whole Health for those that we are very privileged to serve. So the footprint really is focused on density, certainly in our Blue markets, but being able to be focused on our Medicaid markets as well, in places where we see opportunities to grow strategically with Carelon in the future. And that's the pathway and framework that we've established when we think about the long term growth for our Medicare Advantage business which we continue to be incredibly excited about as we think about being a lifetime trusted partner for those we serve. So thank you for the question."

            "name": "Morgan Kendrick",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks for the question. As we think about it, that cohort of business that we renew in July is about 25% of the risk-based large group business. And to camp onto that, it performed as expected. In fact, we're seeing persistency up a bit. We talked about attrition in the large group risk business with our January cohort on the first quarter call, That's abated and we're seeing persistency improve, and we're seeing the margins coming through. So we feel really good about how we're positioned for continued growth and expansion in that business moving forward."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mark Kaye",
            "content": "Thank you, Gail, and good morning to everyone on the line. As Gail shared, we reported second quarter results, including GAAP diluted earnings per share of $9.85 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.12, representing growth of 12% year-over-year. We ended the second quarter with 45.8 million members, principally reflecting attrition in our Medicaid membership. Our commercial fee-based business grew by 354,000 lives year-over-year, reflecting the distinct value we provide to self-insured employers and the strength of the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand. Additionally, the thoughtful positioning of our individual ACA products has proven effective in ensuring robust and profitable growth. Total operating revenue for the quarter was $43.2 billion, approximately flat year-over-year. As we approach the tail-end of Medicaid redeterminations, we anticipate growing operating revenue in the second half of the year, driven by growth in premiums and CarelonRx product revenue related to higher external membership and the acquisition of Paragon Healthcare. Carelon Services' momentum accelerated in the quarter. Operating revenue grew by over 26% and operating earnings increased by more than 30% due to growth in risk-based services provided to internal and external clients, prudent pricing and strong execution. The consolidated benefit expense ratio was 86.3% for the second quarter, an improvement of 10 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was driven by several factors including premium rate adjustments in recognition of medical cost trends, disciplined medical management and a shift in our mix of business towards commercial. This was partially offset by our Medicaid business where acuity has increased due to attrition of healthier members. Elevance Health's adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.5% in the second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2023. We absorbed elevated investment costs notably in CarelonRx and this along with other strategic initiatives will position our company for long-term sustainable growth. We anticipate significant improvement in our operating expense ratio in the second half of this year. Adjusted operating gain for the enterprise grew approximately 6% year-over-year, led by Carelon Services. We have maintained a prudent posture with respect to reserves. Days and claims payable at the end of the second quarter stood at 45.3 days, above our long-term target range in the low 40s. As a reminder, days in claims payable in the first quarter included approximately 1.7 days related to the industry-wide delays in claims receipts. With respect to our outlook, we are closely monitoring acuity and cost trends, notably in Medicaid, and are working collaboratively with states to ensure rates remain actuarily sound. We are, however, expecting second half utilization to increase in Medicaid and as a result, anticipate our full year benefit expense ratio will end the year in the upper half of our initial guidance range. Nonetheless, we expect to achieve our full year adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance of at least $37.20. Before I close, I'd like to briefly talk through our enterprise growth algorithm which we have included in the supplemental earnings presentation provided this morning. Our commitment to growing adjusted diluted earnings per share by at least 12% annually on average incorporates upper single-digit growth in operating revenue, underpinned by membership growth, geographic expansion and momentum in Carelon as we scale our enterprise flywheel. Our commitment to disciplined underwriting and operating expense management across all lines of business will drive the improvement inherent in our enterprise operating margin target of 6.5% to 7% by 2027. Taken together, we are targeting growing operating earnings in the upper single-digit to low double-digit percent range annually on average over time. Finally, we expect capital deployment to consistently deliver one-third of our targeted adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate. Overall, our results in the first half of the year are consistent with our initial guidance, and we will maintain a steadfast focus on execution and operating efficiency over the balance of the year. And with that, operator, please open the call to questions. Thanks very much, Felicia, and good morning. Medicaid utilization in the quarter, as you heard from Felicia, reflected higher acuity as expected. We are also seeing signs of increased utilization across the broader Medicaid population, including in outpatient home health, radiology, durable medical equipment, as well as some elective procedures. I just wanted to add here, just as we noted in our prepared remarks, the full year outlook does allow for both this shift in acuity and increased utilization in the second half of the year, including the rate timing mismatch that Felicia spoke to. Thanks very much for the question. We're not going to comment on in detail where single lines business operating margin may land, given our combined Health Benefits reporting segment. But however, to your question, let me give you a little bit of color. We do expect the Medicaid margins to compress year-over-year. There are key factors driving this, including or beyond the industry-wide dynamics that we're navigating. And those include what we spoke to a moment ago around the timing mismatch of rates relative to acuity and the higher acuity itself associated with the Medicaid membership mix. Importantly, as you heard us talk to you just a moment ago, we are holding very constructive conversations with the states to ensure those rates remain actuarily sound. In Medicare, we do continue to expect margins are going to improve in 2024 compared to 2023. They will still remain below our long-term target margin range. And then finally, we are very pleased with the progress of our 2024 commercial repricing initiatives and our disciplined pricing practices. And we've spoken about this before, but it's worth emphasizing 2023 really marked that first -- or the end of that first full year of our efforts to recover margins and you're seeing some of that benefit together with the action that we're taking in 2024 come through our numbers. Thanks very much for the additional questions here on Medicaid. First, we are seeing a larger than typical pull-forward effect and that's really driven by the increased numbers of Medicaid members who are losing coverage. You can think about this as beneficiaries who are facing an imminent loss of coverage, in the month or so preceding that coverage loss, picking up additional benefits. Second, member mischaracterization among the core expansion in specialized population has caused some localized revenue pressure as some members expect to regain coverage after previously being determined as ineligible. And third, on this topic of Medicaid, elevated outpatient trends in elective procedures. Steve just flagged me, he said to talk about Medicare. So I apologize for that. On Medicare, the answer is very short. Trends developed in line with expectations. Thanks very much for the question. Segment margins in the quarter improved by 20 basis points year-over-year. And I'd argue that the first half results here are consistent with our initial guidance range. And we expect full year margins to end within our initial outlook, up 25 basis points to 50 basis points, primarily driven by the ongoing recovery of our Commercial business. From a seasonality perspective, there are two key comments I wanted to draw out here. For modeling purposes, second quarter revenue growth is going to mark the low point for the year and we expect third and fourth quarter operating revenue and premium revenue growth rates to improve. And then secondly, just on the MLR that ties directly to your question, we now expect the third quarter MLR to be near the high end of our full year guidance range. And I note this specifically, Justin, as the current third quarter consensus estimate does not appear to capture the calendar day shift associated with the Leap year and that's going to have approximately a 70 basis point impact on the third quarter MLR. This quarter, we are pleased to introduce our growth algorithm which underpins our adjusted diluted earnings per share target of average annual growth of at least 12% over time. You asked a little bit about the revision, and we have revised our enterprise revenue growth target from the high single to low double-digits to high single-digits percent range and that's primarily to reflect Medicaid-related attrition that has occurred to date and the impact of the prudent actions that we're taking in our 2024 and 2025 Medicare Advantage bids in response to the risk model revisions. Accordingly, our health benefits segment revenue CAGR should now be in the -- will now be in the mid-to-upper single-digit percent range. But the key point here is our path is much the same. And that really means that we're expecting high-single-digit to low double-digit percent growth in operating earnings. And the key point here to the second half of your question, with approximately one-third contribution from capital deployment and that capital deployment can come through in the form of inorganic activity to support our Carelon businesses. Thank you. Great question. And the opening comments there are completely consistent with the way that we're thinking about it. You should really think about this as we now expect our full year benefit expense ratio to be in the upper half of that initial guidance range, i.e., 87% to 87.5%, principally because of the Medicaid dynamics that we're navigating. We're not looking to provide specific quarter-by-quarter guidance. Thanks very much for the question. Let me put the prior development in the context of the medical claims payment change this quarter. I think that's more instructive to understand the dynamics here. And you saw medical claims payable in the quarter go down by approximately $1.3 billion versus the first quarter. And there are really several factors that drove this and then ultimately drove PYD development. And they include the reserve runoff due to Medicaid membership decline, the catch-up in claims paid associated with elevated reserves for industry-wide claim receipt delays in the first quarter, and then the improved operational environment that's reflected through our shorter cycle times. And the key point here is that MCP, which is why it's more instructive, remains at historically high levels, both in aggregate and on a fully insured PMPM basis. And that indicates the continuity of our historical prudent reserving practices and our strong balance sheet. Thanks for the question and appreciate the opportunity to provide additional clarification here. Certainly, we expect the larger than typical pull-forward effect that we've seen in the second quarter to abate as the year goes on, principally because we're through the tail end of redeterminations at this point. We are obviously working with the states to ensure that the timing and rate mismatch is appropriately adjusted. On the member miscategorization, this is really ensuring that those members who are initially categorized, for example as TANF are put in the more appropriate and -- cohort for purposes of rates to think about ABD, for example. And then what we are really seeing elevate as the year goes on is the outpatient trains and elective procedures, and that's something that we fully accounted for in our MLR guide for the full year. Appreciate the question this morning. Year to date, operating cash flow is $2.4 billion and to your point, that is a decrease of approximately $6 billion year-over-year. The key point here is that this includes $4.3 billion of timing-related items and approximately $1.3 billion of net cash outflows that are primarily associated with the runoff of our Medicaid reserves and the improvement in the operational environment, which is reflected by a short -- shorter cycle times. The timing-related item reflects a $3.6 billion impact from an additional month of premiums that we received from CMS in the year ago period, and so not a concern from our perspective. On a full year basis, we do expect operating cash flow outlook to be slightly north of $7 billion, and that really reflects the year-to-date reductions in working capital and specifically, as I mentioned a moment ago, that decrease in MCP driven by Medicaid membership attrition. Thank you very much for the question, George, and certainly happy to talk through the algorithm at a little bit of a high level. So you can think about this as being driven by upper single-digit growth in revenue, enterprise operating margin expansion to 6.5% to 7%, and then the balanced approach to capital deployment, inclusive of share repurchases and strategic M&A. On the revenue side, revenue growth is going to be driven by increased membership in the health benefits business, geographic expansion efforts, and then prudent pricing to cover cost trend. And then similarly in Carelon, key drivers are going to include the expansion of risk-based revenue in Carelon Services and the continued growth in CarelonRx membership. On the margin side, expansion is going to reflect the disciplined operating expense management and the transformation of some of our business processes, leveraging new technologies, including AI. And that coupled together with -- or at least the way I think about it, effective medical management and underwriting disciplines really going to enable us to achieve the enterprise operating margin target. And then finally, consistent with our 2023 Investor Day guidance, we do expect to achieve approximately a third of our adjusted diluted EPS growth rate through capital deployments. Dave, good morning. Thanks very much for the question. In terms of the 2023 business optimization activity, we are on track to realize the gross run rate expense efficiency improvement of approximately $750 million that we committed to do. And that's going to benefit both our operating performance this year and it's going to help to establish the strong foundation for growth in 2025 and beyond. If I step back just for a moment, and we covered this a bit in our prepared remarks, we do anticipate significant improvement in our operating expense ratio in the second half of the year as we continue to take additional steps to enhance operational efficiency, and we'll begin to see and realize those incremental run rate improvements over time."

            "name": "Pete Haytaian",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks. Thanks a lot for the question, Lance. We feel very good about the overall strategy as it relates to pharmacy. I'll start with how we're performing on the core and growth in the core. Our strategy is resonating in the marketplace. There continues to be a lot of interest in what we're doing as it relates to the strategic levers that matter and how we're insourcing and diversifying our business. And I think our value story is really resonating -- the integrated value story and that's really playing through with highly competitive pricing. And again, we continue to perform very well on the core PBM down-market and middle-market. So we feel very good about that. As it relates to our diversification and your question on our assets, things are going very well. As we talked about with regard to specialty, we spent the last year building out our infrastructure to be able to handle the capacity -- to have the capacity to handle the Elevance scripts and we feel very good about that. We began to migrate scripts at the beginning of this year as it relates to specialty and we continue to move forward in that regard. And importantly, we are preparing right now and continue to make investments around the Kroger close and assuming those scripts as well. Right now, we're projecting that to close Q3, Q4 of this year and again, a lot of preparation and investment to make sure that we do that really well. And then finally, as it relates to Paragon, again, just to reiterate the opportunity there because we feel very, very good about that. We're talking about $16 billion of infusion spend as it relates to Elevance Health with about 50% of that being in the hospital setting. So again, a great opportunity for us to have care be provided in a more appropriate setting, be it in an ambulatory site or in the home and we feel very good about our positioning and the density that we have in our markets as it relates to that. And importantly, as part of that strategy, we are targeting at a zip code level, the stand-up of ambulatory sites to be able to provide that care. We're launching one imminently and then we are preparing and building out strategies to launch others into 2025. So, overall, we feel very good about our strategy of insourcing the strategic levers that matter and the growth opportunity that exists. Yeah, no, thank you. We feel very good about our specialty strategy, and I appreciate the question. I'll try not to repeat what I said before and give you a little bit more context. But as I noted, as it related to our specialty strategy, we acquired BioPlus last year in 2023. And again, we spent a lot of time last year in building out the infrastructure and the capacity to be able to assume Elevance scripts. And our focus as it relates to the near term is being able to migrate Elevance scripts, which will occur through this year and into 2025. As you noted, we're going to be opportunistic and we have been as it relates to things like Kroger, that provides additional scale for us. To give you a little bit of color on Kroger, it's about 500,000 incremental scripts. They also give us access to additional LDDs as well as having a presence in places like Puerto Rico, which could help us as well. And so we'll continue to be opportunistic as it relates to our specialty strategy and really on our focus to deliver whole health. We are anticipating, as I noted earlier, that Kroger would close Q3, Q4 of this year, and we're preparing for that and continuing to make investments around that. And then I'd say as we move forward more broadly and Gail touched upon this as it relates to our specialty strategy, there's a real focus on patient differentiation in Whole Health. We have a wonderful opportunity as we move forward to really drive Whole Health and capture all the value of Carelon, including things like integrating behavioral health and other services. And so that's going to be our goals and focus moving forward. We feel very bullish about it. We feel very bullish about our growth. We feel very bullish about delivering on the Carelon strategy and Whole Health as we move forward. Yes, Sarah, thanks a lot for the question. Appreciate it. And yeah, we're really pleased with how services growth is going. We mentioned 26% growth in the quarter and a clear path of achieving our long term objectives. So we feel very good about that. As it relates to your question, again, our focus is, as Gail said earlier, building capabilities internally and importing them externally, and we're seeing that play through. And your reference to Blues, I would say that we are currently engaged with most of the Blues, and our strategy with regard to that is really landing and expanding, to be quite frank. And this is a great example of that where we had an existing relationship with a client, we continue to grow those services with that particular Blue. They see the value in that. We were able to convert some of those capabilities to risk. And I'll remind you that, that is a very big part of our strategy, assumption of risk, both on a category of service basis as well as a full risk basis. And so, you'll see that continue to move forward. As it relates to the pipeline, this year, we're doing very well. '24 growth year-over-year is very, very strong. So you'll see really nice improvement from that perspective. And as you would expect, we're already selling into 2025. A real focus in 2025 on our behavioral health capabilities, our post-acute capabilities and then some of our Carelon Health businesses. So I appreciate the question, Sarah. Thanks for the question, Ann. We think there's a tremendous opportunity as it relates to specialties. I said, earlier, our priority in the near term is the Elevance scripts, and absorbing the Elevance scripts effectively. And then also, as we talked about what we're doing with Kroger. We continue to see opportunities to cover more LDDs. And then in addition to that, as it relates to Whole Health, we are very focused on the patient experience. We are very focused on centers of excellence and how we can care for the members in a differentiated way by wrapping around additional assets. Longer term, again, we will be opportunistic, but right now, we have a lot in front of us and we want to execute against that effectively as it relates to specialty."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where participants are encouraged to present a single question. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the company's management. Please go ahead.\nSteve Tanal: Good morning, and welcome to Elevance Health's first quarter 2024 earnings call. This is Steve Tanal, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with us this morning on the earnings call are Gail Boudreaux, President and CEO; Mark Kaye, our CFO; Peter Haytaian, President of Carelon; Morgan Kendrick, President of our Commercial Health Benefits Business; and Felicia Norwood, President of our Government Health Benefits Business. Gail will begin the call with a brief discussion of the quarter, recent progress against our strategic initiatives, and our updated outlook for the year. Mark will then discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail. After our prepared remarks, the team will be available for Q&A. During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website, elevancehealth.com. We will also be making some forward-looking statements on this call. Listeners are cautioned that these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Elevance Health. These risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to carefully review the risk factors discussed in today's press release and in our quarterly filings with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Gail.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Elevance Health delivered first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $9.59 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.64, reflecting growth of 12.5%. These results reflect disciplined execution of our strategic initiatives during a dynamic time for our industry. Given the solid start to the year, we have increased our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.10 to be greater than $37.20. We are making significant progress on our enterprise strategy in 2024 to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high growth opportunities, and optimize our Health Benefits business. On Monday, we announced the next step in our journey to expand access to high-quality patient-centered value-based care in our local markets. After years of experience working closely with care providers to advance value-based care, we are confident that our hyper-local approach, which aligns the right incentives, real-time patient information and clinical decision support tools, delivers better health outcomes, improved consumer and provider experience, and greater affordability. Accordingly, we entered into an agreement to form a strategic partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to build a payer-agnostic advanced primary care and physician-enablement business, serving consumers across commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid health plans, consistent with the diversity of our own medical membership. Upon formation, the combined company will serve nearly 1 million consumers. The new venture will bring together the strengths of three innovative care provider entities, including certain care delivery and enablement assets of Carelon Health. Importantly, we have worked closely with these companies and their management teams and are confident in the value they deliver for our Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plan members and employers. We're excited to collaborate with CD&R and a broad range of care provider partners to accelerate innovation, enhance healthcare experiences, and improve health outcomes for consumers. The collaborative development of the business will advance our enterprise strategy by accelerating the provision of value-based care for our members and consumers more broadly, with our Carelon businesses providing capabilities to integrate and personalize the care delivered. In time, Elevance Health will have full ownership of what we expect will be a leading platform for value-based care delivery and physician enablement at scale across commercial group, ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid health plans, advancing our role as a lifetime trusted health partner for the consumers we are privileged to serve. In the first quarter, we made tangible progress on our strategic initiatives, notably in Carelon, where we continue to scale our flywheel for enterprise growth. Carelon Rx closed its acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a leading provider of infusion services. We are looking forward to expanding its geographic reach and therapeutic coverage to serve more consumers and Elevance Health members for years to come. As Carelon Rx furthers our enterprise commitment to address the whole health needs of our members, notably those with chronic and complex conditions, we are accelerating the buildout of our own specialty pharmacy. For example, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire Kroger's Specialty Pharmacy business, the sixth largest specialty pharmacy in the country. The acquisition will bolster the growth of our existing pharmacy and infusion businesses while increasing Carelon Rx's access to limited distribution drugs. Carelon Services is also off to a strong start this year as we implemented and were awarded multiple new contracts, a testament to the value Carelon services provides. For instance, Carelon Behavioral Health was selected by the Maryland Department of Health to provide behavioral health management services to more than 1.7 million Medicaid members starting in 2025. And in California, our team will partner with the public school system to expand behavioral health management services for students later this year. This initiative represents a major step forward in addressing the critical need for mental health support in educational settings and demonstrates our commitment to improving the health and well-being of our communities. Momentum with external clients is building and underscores the value Carelon Services is creating for health plan customers through better consumer experiences and improved affordability. Our health benefits business is similarly off to a solid start. Commercial margin continues to recover from pandemic era lows, and we are enjoying momentum in membership growth, notably in our individual ACA plans and among large self-insured employers. Existing clients are demonstrating their confidence in our offerings by consolidating their business with us after years of offering our solutions side by side with those of our competitors. In our Medicaid business, we were pleased to be selected in Florida and Virginia to serve beneficiaries across traditional and complex populations statewide, including those with serious mental illness in Florida and sole source foster care in Virginia. These awards and their pull-through opportunities for Carelon services underscore the distinct value Elevance Health delivers. In the first quarter, our Medicaid business performed in line with our expectations. We estimate that nearly 90% of our members have had their eligibility redetermined. Further, our team continues to work tirelessly to maximize access to care for Medicaid members subject to eligibility redetermination, helping them to understand their options in the face of ongoing logistical and operational challenges. Holistically, we are proud of the work we have done in contacting more than 4.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries through our omni-channel approach. Nonetheless, a majority of members who have lost coverage for administrative reasons have not yet returned. We're seeing a gradual increase in Medicaid re-enrollment and anticipate continued upticks in rejoiner rates as more Medicaid beneficiaries recognize their need to re-enroll, aligned with the trends that we have observed in recent months. Turning to Medicare. We were pleased to announce last month that CMS updated the Star scores for four of our contracts, which increased the percentage of our members in four star or higher-rated contracts to nearly 50%, up from 34%. While this will improve our star quality bonus revenue in 2025, our goal is to have our star quality ratings at the high end of all plans in our local markets, which will be a multi-year journey. Funding for Medicare in 2025 will be challenging for the entire industry. We are disappointed that CMS has decided to cut Medicare Advantage rates for the second consecutive year, which will negatively impact seniors, notably those at the lower end of the income spectrum who rely on the program for their health and wellbeing. While we remain committed to serving seniors through plan offerings that focus on their unique needs, we will also continue to demonstrate discipline in our Medicare Advantage bids seeking to balance growth and margin while continuing to deliver exceptional value for seniors. Across the enterprise, our focus on delivering whole health for the consumers we are privileged to serve remains steadfast. We recently released our 2023 Advancing Health Together progress report, which underscores the strides we are making through value-based care. The report showcases examples of our success, facilitated by the unique partnerships that we've created with care providers across the healthcare ecosystem. I'd like to highlight a particular achievement that underscores our innovative approach to improving quality and value in healthcare. Recently, Elevance Health was honored by the NCQA with its Innovation Award, featuring quality accelerators in healthcare for leading-edge strategies that improve quality and value, specifically for our obstetrics specialty provider enablement program. The impact of these value-based partnerships and clinical interventions has led to consistent improvements in health outcomes and costs, including reducing preterm birth rates by 12% and low birth weight babies by 20%, all while improving access to timely prenatal care and postpartum follow-up. For those interested in learning more about these transformative initiatives and other examples of our progress, I encourage you to visit our Advancing Health Together website. In closing, I want to extend my deep gratitude to our 100,000 associates who embody our purpose of improving the health of humanity through their tireless commitment. It's also heartening to see their efforts recognized externally. We were honored to be named to Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work for list for the fourth year in a row. We were also included in their World's Most Admired Companies and America's Most Innovative Companies list. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Kaye to provide more on our operating results and outlook. Mark?\nMark Kaye: Thank you, Gail. As you heard earlier, our first quarter results reflect solid performance under a dynamic operating environment. We ended March with 46.2 million members reflecting Medicaid attrition, partially offset by ongoing momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter, we added nearly 400,000 commercial fee-based members, driven by strong retention and a successful national account selling season, and over 200,000 individual ACA members, given our attractive product positioning and coverage transitions away from Medicaid. Medicare Advantage membership declined slightly, as expected, given select market exits and the collective actions we continue to take to establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long term. Operating revenue for the quarter was $42.3 billion, in line with our expectations. The consolidated benefit expense ratio of 85.6% improved 20 basis points year-over-year due to disciplined premium rate adjustments to reflect medical cost trends and the ongoing recovery of commercial margins from pandemic era lows. The adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.4%, consistent with the first quarter of 2023, indicative of our commitment to disciplined expense management and investment prioritization. Solid performance and growth in operating gain for both our health benefits and Carelon segments of $138 million and $72 million respectively, led to growth in consolidated adjusted operating gains of over 7%. Carelon Services had a particularly strong start to the year with revenue and operating earnings growth driven by risk based service line expansions and effective cost management, especially in our Carelon Insights and Carelon Behavioral Health businesses, further accelerating our enterprise flywheel or growth. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $2 billion, or approximately 0.9 times net income. With respect to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 39.4%, in line with our target range, preserving ongoing capital allocation flexibility. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $566 million during the quarter, underscoring our confidence in the intrinsic value of our shares and the long-term value proposition. We maintained our prudent and consistent approach to reserving. Days in claims payable stood at 49 days as of March 31st, up three days from the prior year quarter. This increase was largely driven by higher reserves associated with slower claims receipts due to an industry-wide disruption that impacted a major claims clearinghouse. As a reminder, we expect our days in claims payable to be in the low 40s range long term. I'd also like to take a moment to provide additional color on our strategic partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. We are excited to partner with CD&R to scale what will be a best-in-class, payor agnostic advanced care delivery and enablement platform catering to the unique needs of consumers, regardless of their form of coverage. This collaboration will allow us to advance our local-oriented approach to care delivery based on the unique needs of the communities, consumers, and employers we are privileged to serve. At the onset, Elevance Health will hold a significant minority position in the combined business with a clear path to first majority and then full ownership in approximately five years. The formation of the strategic partnership includes our capital contribution in the form of cash and our equity interest in certain care delivery and enablement assets of Carelon Health as well as the conveyance from CD&R of our pre-health in Millennium Physician Group, and is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the solid start to the year. Momentum in our health benefits and Carelon businesses and the balance and resilience of our enterprise underscores our confidence in delivering another year of growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share consistent with our long-term compound annual growth rate of at least 12%. As we look forward to the rest of 2024, our focus will remain on successfully executing our strategy as we accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high growth opportunities, and optimize our health benefits business. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] For our first question, we'll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nLance Wilkes: Great. Thanks so much. Let me ask a little bit about the value-based care strategy and the execution that's obviously a really big step forward. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the vision and scope of this? Is this going to be more focused on enablement or in particular markets, is practice ownership going to be important? Then maybe if you can kind of color in the picture a little bit as far as leadership, names, which Carelon assets are going to be contributed. And near term, do you see which areas of leverage across the membership base of Elevance, do you see this being able to penetrate most effectively? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, great. Thanks so much for the question, Lance. First, as I shared on in my opening comments, we're very excited about this partnership with CD&R, because it is very much the next step in our journey to bring value-based care to more consumers, specifically about partnering closely with care providers. And we see it as absolutely consistent to driving greater risk adoption and advancing our specialty enablement strategy as well. So it's very much a first step there. And as you said in your question, this aligns very closely with our strategy and our broad partnership focus to work directly with care providers in our local markets. And our goal again remains to increase more downside risk sharing in our value-based arrangements. I think, to take a step back, what makes this approach unique is that we're enabling value-based care across all lines of business. So, as I shared, the combined company is going to be payor-agnostic, and it's focused on enabling advanced primary care locally. And from the get-go, it's going to serve nearly 1 million consumers, and that's going to be across our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health plans upon formation. Another thing I think is important is that it provides the opportunity to pull through Carelon services to support those patients and accelerate that specialty enablement for complex and chronic patients. We have been working with these management teams and these assets for some time and feel very confident about the alignment of our goals to serve as a lifetime trusted health partner. The goal gets back again to focusing on whole health, the needs of consumers, driving greater affordability, and fundamentally differentiate a consumer experience. A few things about the partnership too, and again, what makes it different for patients. They're going to have access to integrated teams. We're looking at personalized navigation, expanded digital assets, and specialized services. The primary care model is going to be built to be very distinctive, including community practices, purpose-built clinics, high-risk clinics, and digitally-enabled care models. So, as you can see, it's a fairly comprehensive approach. And the last thing I'd say is that employers in the market have not historically had access to a lot of these capabilities. And we have seen through the work that we're already doing, that this dedicated primary care capacity that integrates the clinical and benefits navigation with their specific health and wellness strategies is truly differentiating. So again, this is being purpose-built to work across all of the aspects of [Medicare, Medicare] (ph), commercial, not just a single business. So very much excited. We see this as an opportunity to accelerate innovation in the space and improve healthcare outcomes and consumer experiences. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of AJ Rice from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAJ Rice: Hi, everybody. Thanks for the question. I appreciate Mark's comments about the buildup, a little bit in days in claims payable, but just maybe to flesh out a little bit more the impact of the Change cyber-attack on results. Do you have a census of what percentage of your claims that you normally see in the first quarter may still be out there? Do you feel like you've got a good handle on that? And anything when you address that in terms of your normal IV&R, maybe you've got a significantly higher level of IV&R because you're allowing for the Change and if you can break out what you're actually seeing a little bit on cost trends versus needing to sort of provision for the unknowns of the Change cyber-attack.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, AJ. Let me maybe provide some broad-based comments and then I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more specificity on your questions. Now, I want to say first and foremost, I'm really proud of our teams and how they responded to this issue that occurred with Change quickly and effectively, first to protect our members and their data, and also help our care providers maintain their operations and cash flow. Importantly, I think it's important to note that from a perspective, we were not as significantly impacted by this and we are back to normal operations in terms of claims flow. Importantly, another thing that's really important to understand is our prior authorization provider payments and pharmacy claims were not materially impacted as well because they don't go through Change. We don't use Change significantly for those. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more comments. But I think framing it overall, we feel that our teams acted quite quickly and really proud of our ability to work in the ecosystem to help support them.\nMark Kaye: AJ, as you just heard from Gail, we acted quite responsibly to sever our network connections to Change Healthcare and to protect the data of both our members and providers. While we initially observed a 15% to 20% reduction in the daily volume of electronic data receipts from providers, most of which were claims related, in recent weeks our extensive efforts have led to a significant catch-up in outstanding claim volumes. And for the quarter, we are effectively caught up on claims receipts and are now working to complete all necessary claims adjudication and processing activities. As such, as part of the normal reserving practices, we've reflected the appropriate impact of the industry-wide disruption related to Change Healthcare in the reserves we've reported for our first quarter financials, and that ensures both consistency with historical practice and prudence. And then to your specific question, the impact here was to increase our sequential days in claims payable quarterly result by approximately 1.7 days.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Please, go ahead.\nJosh Raskin: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to get back to the partnership with CD&R and specifically what alternatives did you evaluate and consider before coming to this arrangement? And I think in the past, you were stressing more and I've heard it today as well that focus on specialty care. So how does that fit in and sort of get bolted on, on top of this? And maybe where does this fit into your longer term national approach? And then how important was it that you could serve multiple memberships inside not just Medicare Advantage? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh, because I think it very much aligns to the strategy that we've laid out. I guess first and foremost, it's payor-agnostic, and it was really important. We've always said that our goal, given the diversity of our business mix, serve all members across all business lines, given the depth and density of our membership on our local markets, that is very important. We had a partnership already working with many of these assets. So as I said, we know the membership -- we know the leadership teams, we know the value that can be created. And so, we have been working with them and feel quite good about what we can create. This is payor-agnostic, which we also think is very important. And again, this will help us continue through having a focus on advanced primary care, it's still very much focused on our chronic patients and complex patients. And we are still building specialty care enablement, which is, again, another very important component of what we're trying to probe through. So I think from that value-based care across all lines of business, a critical part of our strategy, very consistent, driving value-based care, continuing to drive much more downside risk, which means that we needed strong enabling capabilities to help practices work their way through that. We know that it takes time. It is also a technology-driven model. So one of the nice things about this partnership is that there are embedded technology assets to digitally-enabled care as well. And then we have a focus on patient access and experience in the adoption of next generation models. So again, consistent with the strategy that we've had over the last several years, not really a diversion, I think, from that. And I think the timing for us was right because we have been experimenting with multiple models and have a lot of experience in the space right now. So thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBen Hendrix: Hey, thank you very much. Just another question on the CD&R partnership. To what extent are these primary care platforms taking risk currently? Is that something that we will need to see develop as we kind of get more of these digital enablement abilities from Carelon? Just wanted to see if over the five-year horizon to full ownership, if we can expect to kind of get the full capitation on those platforms over that time period? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Ben. I'm going to have Pete probably provide a lot more context. But just quickly, about a third of the membership is under risk arrangement now. So with that, Pete, why don't you give a little more color into the relationship and how we see it evolve.\nPeter Haytaian: That's great. Thanks for the question, Ben. And I'll give you a little bit more color on the assets and the capabilities. They really all have their distinct strengths. We see great opportunities, quite frankly, to cross-pollinate. When you think about MPG to your question on risk, they really are a leader in managing Medicare and commercial risk. And they've also got a very strong chassis I think, for future growth and a proven model in that regard in terms of acquiring and providing practices. So very strong at managing risk and a lot of capabilities in that regard. What's really interesting about apree and Gail referenced this is they've got a differentiating technology and navigation capabilities with a real strong focus on the commercial business. So a really nice entry point for us. We've been working on relationships already in this regard. And I'm really excited about that because we, obviously, as a company, have a really strong commercial footprint, a really nice entry point for us. And then, of course, Carelon Health advanced primary care which is a leader in managing the complex and the chronic and largely takes risk today. We see a tremendous opportunity in a variety of ways for that. One, from a technology perspective, state-of-the-art EMR that we can upgrade as well as from a growth perspective in terms of partnering with MPG and apree. And then finally, and Gail mentioned this, but I'll reiterate it, a tremendous opportunity to wrap around existing Carelon services to this arrangement that will create value for all three assets. So, appreciate the question.\nMark Kaye: And then 1 quick financial remark just at the end of Pete's comments there. We do expect the consolidated entity once formed to have over $4 billion in annualized debt revenue.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDave Windley: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'll switch topics over to Medicaid. Your redetermination enrollment impacts seem to, maybe pick up some momentum in the quarter. I think you said 90% of members have now been redetermined. I wondered If you could give us some view of kind of how you expect that to gate out over the next several quarters? And then from a risk pool and rate adequacy standpoint, could you update on how that looks now that the membership is whittling down? Thank you.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you. I'm going to have Felicia Norwood address your questions.\nFelicia Norwood: Good morning, Dave, and thank you for the question. Frankly, right now we're at a point where our Medicaid business is actually tracking very much in line with our expectations. As you referenced, we believe that about 90% of our members have had their eligibility redetermined. So as we go through the next few months, you certainly see this tapering down as we really wrap up the unwinding process as we get through June. One of the things I want to make sure you understand, the downward trend in membership in the first quarter resulted not just from re-determinations, but footprint changes as well. So it's really the cumulative impact of those two things in terms of the first quarter. When we think about the work that we will continue to do is we will continue to outreach to Medicaid members. Many members who have lost their membership at this point did that as a result of really procedural reasons. So the team will continue to be very aggressive around continuing the outreach that's been going on. And we're really proud of the work that we continue to do to really reach out to over 4.5 million people, as Gail referenced in the opening comments, to make sure that individuals who are truly eligible for Medicaid have access to Medicaid and, if not, are able to transition to an exchange product and continue coverage. In terms of where we are today with respect to, the acuity and mix of that membership, the acuity is in line with what we expected. And I will also say that at this point we have visibility into 75% of our Medicaid rates and premiums for 2024. The vast majority of those are in line with our expectations and they're actuarially sound. As you know, we have ongoing conversations with our state partners as we go throughout this process and we expect those rates to continue to be actuarially sound. So we're going to continue to work with our state partners. We're going to continue the advocacy with our members in terms of making sure they have access to care and coverage. And we're going to make sure that we go through this process with a lot of discipline and rigor, understand the mix of our membership and the levers versus [payors] (ph) as we go through this process. Thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nLisa Gill: Hi, good morning and thank you. I was wondering if maybe you could talk about utilization trends by line of business and what you saw in the quarter versus your expectation.\nMark Kaye: Lisa, thanks very much for the question. So utilization in the first quarter in our health benefits businesses was in line with our expectation and that was reflected in our reported benefit expense ratio of approximately 85.6%. In the commercial business, specifically inpatient and outpatient authorization levels year to date were aligned with our expectations and our internal year-to-go trend remains unchanged. On Medicare, as expected, we saw utilization related to both the two midnight rule for inpatient stays as well as pockets of outpatient authorizations around, for example, at radiology and cardiovascular procedures. And importantly, these trends were broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost trend assumptions. Medicaid, as you heard Felicia talk about a moment ago, did experience increased but state-specific utilization attributed to the redetermination, mix impacts, and we remain very comfortable with what we're seeing there given those ongoing constructive dialogues with the impacted states. And so overall, we remain confident that both our MA bids for 2024 and our commercial pricing really reflect the appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKevin Fischbeck: Great. Thanks. Just wondering if, it's not a huge increase in guidance, but would love to kind of hear what was driving the increase in guidance. Is it something on the health plan side? Is it on the Carelon side? And I guess just thoughts about how you thought about providing increases in guidance. It sounds like you believe that visibility is relatively high in claims, but obviously there's some concern there. So I don't know if there's any conservatism or thought about pace of raises versus what you're actually seeing in the core business today. Thanks.\nMark Kaye: We were pleased to report our adjusted deleted EPS this quarter, which came in slightly better than our seasonal expectation. And that was led by solid performance in both our health benefits and Carelon divisions, where operating margin increased by 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively, highlighting what we see as disciplined execution of our initiatives during a dynamic time for the industry. Of specific notes, and you referenced this in your question, was the favorable performance in the first quarter benefit expense ratio and that was driven by commercial margins that continue to recover from pandemic era lows. We're very pleased with the Q1 results. It's still early in the year and given our business is subject to some variability around medical cost trends, we're intentionally remaining thoughtful and prudent in our outlook and that led us to increase our guide for adjusted EPS by $0.10 to be greater than $37.20.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Whit Mayo from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nWhit Mayo: Hey, thanks. Just wanted to hear any comments on the external revenue growth with Carelon Services. Did that grow faster than the overall segment? You did, I think, reference some strong external growth. So curious what might be gaining traction in the market. And then just a quick question on guidance. Mark, you've averaged maybe 55% to 56% of earnings in the first half. Any reason that would be different this year? Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Great. Why don't I have Pete address sort of the Carelon questions and then Mark will talk about the earnings percentages. Pete?\nPeter Haytaian: Yeah, thanks for the question. As it relates to Carelon external growth, we continue to see a really nice momentum in our build. I mean, for 2024, from an overall sales perspective, we've already this time of the year, exceeded what we did in all 2023. And you heard Gail mention in her prepared remarks several new wins, which we're really excited about, really growth across the portfolio with some notable wins in behavioral health. She mentioned winning a statewide account in Medicaid for Maryland, which we're really excited about, and then some new innovative solutions with large employers as well as wins in the state of California. And on the behavioral health side, also some select wins in the crisis space, so areas that we've been really focused on. In addition to that, we've had some notable wins with the Blues related to our insights business. We've talked about this before, but it's really critical that we prove some of our risk arrangements and our differentiated capabilities in Elevance and then port those to the Blues. And we've seen that play through with several notable wins. Lastly, I'd say we're excited about the \u201825 pipeline. We're obviously actively in the selling season, our pipeline is very rich. And again, I would say a large focus on our insights businesses, as well as our behavioral health businesses.\nMark Kaye: On your second question, the seasonality of the adjusted diluted EPS in 2024 is expected to be consistent with the past several years with approximately 55% of earnings in the first half of the year. I also want to call out that workday seasonality, given it is a leap year, did result in a smaller than historically normal impact in the first quarter. But we expect the workday seasonality to put slightly more pressure on the third quarter MLR with an offsetting favorability than in the fourth quarter as those workdays normalize.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks, Mark, and thanks for the question, Whit. And I just want to add to Pete's comments about just the momentum that we're seeing inside of Carelon. First, our proof points are within Elevance Health, and then secondarily now seeing some really nice momentum and traction externally. So thanks for the question. And next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. Gail, I wanted to follow up on your comments on the Medicare business and the goal of balancing growth and margins. Could you maybe just elaborate on that, given the tougher rate environment that you highlighted? And I think the companies prioritize margin improvement in Medicare this year. Does that kind of remain on track for 2024? And do you expect to plan for further improvement in 2025?\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks for the question, Nathan. As I shared in my opening comments, first of all, the Medicare rate announcement, as you've heard, represents the second year of consecutive cuts to the program that we know will result in increased premiums and reduced benefits for seniors with disabilities and particularly those that have really needed this program. Our approach is very consistent. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach to the Medicare business. Our focus is to get consistency, high-value competitive benefits, and balanced growth and margins. We're focused on building a sustainable, attractive, long-term business. It's too early to provide specifics for the 2025 bid at this stage, but again, I'm going to repeat, we're looking to really balance growth and margins. As we talked about in our Investor Day, our focus is on keeping our members Blue for life and there we\u2019re focused on particularly our 14 Blue states and continuing to prioritize the very significant business we have in DSNP where our unique competitive advantage is serving the needs of those consumers with complex conditions. So overall, we're in the midst of the process right now, so we'll have more as we get through the bid process, but thank you very much for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nStephen Baxter: Hi, thanks. Just interested. It seems like now you're talking about an at least 12% EPS CAGR as your long-term expectations in both the slides and the prepared remarks. Like obviously in the past, you've talked about a 12% to 15% EPS growth CAGR target. Just wondering what if anything, we should be reading into that? Thank you.\nMark Kaye: Thank you very much for the question. You should see these two targets as synergistic. We remain firmly committed to achieving a long-term adjusted earnings per share CAGR of 12% to 15% through 2027 as we communicated at our Investor Day event last year. And then as we think more broadly around the long-term, we have confidence that through business cycles and over time, the earnings power of our health benefits and Carelon flywheel will generate the momentum and the foundation that's needed to sustain a long-term compound annual growth rate of at least 12%.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cancer Fitzgerald. Please go ahead. And Sarah, your line is open.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Andrew Mok from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Mok: Hi. Good morning. Hoping you can give us an update on your transition of specialty scripts to BioPlus and help us understand the contribution that that's expected to have this year. Thanks.\nGail Boudreaux: Thanks. Let me have Pete address your question.\nPeter Haytaian: Yeah, thanks for the question, Andrew. Listen, the integration of BioPlus is going well. As you know, we remain on an accelerated calendar regarding this. I'll just reiterate, we spent last year building out the infrastructure and the team, and we did begin migrating scripts in January of this year. And we're doing so really on a staged basis. So we'll continue to do the migration throughout \u201824 and into 2025 as it relates to the Elevance Health book of business. I'd say overall things are going well. The infrastructure build is going well in addition to the BioPlus dispensing facilities that are in place. We're live with one additional facility now as we speak and we have two more going live this year. So we feel very good about the capacity, not only with respect to the Elevance Health business, but business beyond that. So we're excited, we're on a path, and again it will be staged throughout \u201824 and \u201825.\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah, in addition, I'll just add to what Pete said, to BioPlus, as you know, we also announced the acquisition of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, and that is also well aligned to Carelon\u2019s effort to control those levers that matter. So thank you for the question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Hill: Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I -- Gail, first I'd like to follow up on Dave's question on Medicaid and I guess can you talk about where you think we are in the kind of where, in -- I guess, in the calendar and the mix of rate determinations versus acuity mix and kind of I guess I'm trying to get a sense for how far behind do you think the kind of the rate repricings are versus the changes in acuity mix from redetermination? And given that you just talked about specialty, I'd love if you could just add a comment on the Kroger deal and if you expect those scripts to transfer over to BioPlus and how you think about the stickiness of those scripts?\nGail Boudreaux: Yeah, George, I think Felicia pretty much covered your question, which is, we think things are quite aligned at this point. So in terms of the acuity and the mix, everything, we have visibility into 75% of our Medicaid premiums. We've had very constructive discussions with our states. So, overall, we feel things are lining up. They're actuarially sound, and our conversations are ongoing. So, I feel very good about our Medicaid business, just to sort of put a finer point on that. In terms of Kroger, I'm going to ask Pete to comment on Kroger and how that's going to align with our broader pharmacy business.\nPeter Haytaian: Yeah, George, thanks for the question on Kroger. And as Gail alluded to it, we're excited about this deal. It furthers the Carelon and the pharmacy strategy. It certainly is a natural extension of our recent arrangement with BioPlus. And just to give you some background, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy is the largest non-payer-owned specialty pharmacy. They do about 500,000 scripts a year, And it really is a natural complement to what we're doing with both BioPlus and Paragon, quite frankly. To give you a sense of what this is going to do for us, it's going to add meaningful scale. It increases our access to more LDDs, limited distribution drugs, which is very important. Certainly strengthens our relationship with manufacturers, enabling us to really provide greater affordability and quality. And in fact, it has a nice presence in Puerto Rico, which could be very helpful to our MMM business. As it relates to your question on transition of scripts, we feel very good about that. I mean, obviously, in this case with specialty pharmacy, providers and members have choice, but we feel very good about the execution model. We feel very good about the stickiness of the scripts, and we believe the integration and the transition will be straightforward. We expect the arrangement to likely close in Q3 and Q4 this year.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line up Scott Fidel from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nScott Fidel: Hi, thanks. Just interested if we could double-click on the Carelon Services margins in the first quarter with the 90 basis points of expansion. Anything specifically that you would call out there, and then that pacing does seem to be quite a bit stronger than the full-year guidance where you had sort of called for a flattish to down 30 basis points. So, curious whether you have any updates for us just on how you expect Carelon Services margins to trend for the full year. Thanks.\nMark Kaye: Thank you very much for the question. Margins were better than expected in the first quarter, and that aligned very well to very strong revenue growth in the quarter, given the launch of several new internal risk deals, which we expect to accelerate as the year goes on. We're not seeking to update our full year guidance at this time, given that both the seasonality of the business continues to evolve as we expand our risk-based revenue and the timing of new product launches is anticipated to result in some transitory quarterly volatility. But let me turn it over to Pete for a couple of minutes to talk about what we're doing.\nPeter Haytaian: Yeah, no, it's appreciated. And Mark's really covered it. But think about it this way. We are launching some pretty significant risk arrangements this year. We've talked about it, but a full risk arrangement in oncology, a full risk arrangement with the seriously mentally ill. And you should think about this as a natural cadence to launching this throughout the year, and that's what's going to impact the margins. So, for example, with the seriously mentally ill, we're doing this largely with the Medicaid business. It's not a big bang across all the Medicaid states immediately, as you'd expect. It's more methodical state by state in \u201824 and \u201825.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lake: Thanks. Good morning. There are some significant changes coming in the Part D space for 2025. I was curious as to your view on what that could mean for premiums. Just maybe you could tell us where you think kind of industry premiums are this year and where how significant that increase could be for 2025.\nGail Boudreaux: I'm going to ask Felicia to address that.\nFelicia Norwood: So, good morning, Justin, and thank you for the question. There are significant changes coming for 2025, and I'll say this, it's early to provide specifics around what our 2025 strategy is going to be. But as Gail mentioned before, we are going to make sure that we have a very balanced approach as we think about the margins around our Medicare business and focus on those things that we believe bring the highest value to our members as we really work to make sure we have a competitive product in-market that meets the needs of those members that we're trying to serve with a lot of dynamic changes that are going on in the Medicare environment for 2025. So thank you for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Ann Hynes from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnn Hynes: Yeah, thank you. Congrats on retaining the Florida contract, but it looks like you're actually gaining market share. Can you let us know the membership growth? And also looking ahead over the next couple of years, is there any big state renewal risks for Elevance and alternatively, is there any big RFP opportunities for you? Thanks.\nFelicia Norwood: So, good morning, Ann, and thank you. We are certainly very pleased with the results in Florida. It's a state that we have been partnering in for a long period of time, but certainly the win here allows us to expand our footprint and additionally serve some complex populations, particularly SMI, which will be very much kind of a collaboration with our Carelon Services business, so very excited about that. We are also very focused on our Virginia go-live, which is coming up in July as well. So a lot of work happening there. Outstanding at this point is certainly Georgia, where we will be defending our procurement with respect to our core business, as well as our foster care business in the state of Georgia, and feel very good about the work that we continue to do there in partnership with the state. In addition, we are very much focused on a couple of new geographies where we are bidding this year and look forward to hearing those results. But on top of that, the states are very much focused on specialty populations, and we see that as the opportunity for growth as we go forward. Medicaid is a very important business for us. Our recent RFP wins, I think, demonstrate the value that we bring to our state partners, but more importantly, the improvement in quality of outcomes that we are providing to Medicaid beneficiaries. So thank you very much for the question.\nGail Boudreaux: Next question, please.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Gary Taylor from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGary Taylor: Hi. Good morning. Two quick ones for me. I just wanted to come back to Medicaid for a second. I mean, it's obvious your commercial book is doing very well, but you had expected Medicaid margins to come down this year, but you're saying the rate adjustments you're getting are actuarially sound for the acuity changes. So should we think about the lower Medicaid margins this year primarily just the deleveraging the OpEx impact of losing the revenue and enrollment and that MLR is going to be fairly stable? And then just my second question was, Mark made this comment, John made this comment for years about how days claims payable would eventually come down into the low 40s. That's a lot of inherent or embedded earnings power that could come through the P&L at some point over time. Can you give us any sort of sense of what long-term means in terms of seeing the reserves move lower?\nMark Kaye: Gary, good morning and thank you for the questions. Let me start maybe with the margins and let me bring it up to the health benefits business segment to talk about first. So in terms of health benefits, the margins this quarter were very much in line with our expectations. It puts us squarely on track to achieve our guidance for the full year of an increase between 25 basis points and 50 basis points. I'm not looking necessarily to comment on a single business' margin, but you could expect Medicaid margins to normalize, given we already have line of sight, and you heard Felicia talk about this, into approximately 75% of the Medicaid premiums for 2024, and that we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the rates that we are seeing. Over the long term, Medicaid continues to normalize as we spoke about last quarter, and it is performing as expected. On the DCP, for 2024, if we look out through the end of the year, we're anticipating remaining in the mid to upper 40s range given Medicaid membership is expected to decline to within our guidance range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members. And as you know, Medicaid has a slightly lower relative DCP compared to commercial, for example. And then over time, to reiterate the guidance, we do expect over the long term, DCPs to return to that more normalized range in the low 40s.\nGail Boudreaux: Thank you, Mark. One more question, please.\nOperator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Sarah James from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nSarah James: Thank you. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things. One, on the reserve boost, are you saying the 1.7 days is fully related to conservatism via Change? Because that seems like about a $600 reserve boost to us, so I wanted to see if there was any other factors in that 1.7 days. And second, could you give us a sense of your Medicaid rate seasonality? Like, what percent of your book renews in 1Q versus 2Q versus 3Q?\nMark Kaye: On your first question, the sequential increase in days in claims payable at quarter result of 1.7 days is primarily related to the Change Healthcare. I just want to -- -maybe one clarification around this. It's worth noting that neither the decrease in claims receipts that we saw during the quarter or the reserve accrual that we took related to Change Healthcare had any discernible impact on our benefit expense ratio or P&L. And that's because we believe the reserve represents an amount we would otherwise have paid had there been no disruption. So you should think about this as overall for the quarter, incurred claims are completely consistent with our expectations. Given some of the notes that came out this morning, I also would like to just reiterate that we do expect operating cash flow to be at least $8.1 billion for the full year, reiterating our earlier guidance.\nFelicia Norwood: And, Sarah, just on your question with respect to our Medicaid states and when our rates are up for renewal, we have roughly 10 states that renew in January, another state that renews in April, another nine that renew in July, and then the last two renew in the back half of the year in September and October.\nGail Boudreaux: Well, thank you very much for your questions. Just in some closing thoughts, we're very pleased to be off to a solid start this year, and we're confident, as you heard in the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about the future and look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health and have a great rest of your week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, a recording of this conference will be available for replay after 11:00 a.m. today through May 17, 2024.

            "name": "Gail Boudreaux",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining today's earnings call. I'm pleased to report that Elevance Health delivered first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $9.59 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $10.64, reflecting growth of 12.5%. These results reflect disciplined execution of our strategic initiatives during a dynamic time for our industry. Given the solid start to the year, we have increased our guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.10 to be greater than $37.20. We are making significant progress on our enterprise strategy in 2024 to accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high growth opportunities, and optimize our Health Benefits business. On Monday, we announced the next step in our journey to expand access to high-quality patient-centered value-based care in our local markets. After years of experience working closely with care providers to advance value-based care, we are confident that our hyper-local approach, which aligns the right incentives, real-time patient information and clinical decision support tools, delivers better health outcomes, improved consumer and provider experience, and greater affordability. Accordingly, we entered into an agreement to form a strategic partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to build a payer-agnostic advanced primary care and physician-enablement business, serving consumers across commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid health plans, consistent with the diversity of our own medical membership. Upon formation, the combined company will serve nearly 1 million consumers. The new venture will bring together the strengths of three innovative care provider entities, including certain care delivery and enablement assets of Carelon Health. Importantly, we have worked closely with these companies and their management teams and are confident in the value they deliver for our Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plan members and employers. We're excited to collaborate with CD&R and a broad range of care provider partners to accelerate innovation, enhance healthcare experiences, and improve health outcomes for consumers. The collaborative development of the business will advance our enterprise strategy by accelerating the provision of value-based care for our members and consumers more broadly, with our Carelon businesses providing capabilities to integrate and personalize the care delivered. In time, Elevance Health will have full ownership of what we expect will be a leading platform for value-based care delivery and physician enablement at scale across commercial group, ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid health plans, advancing our role as a lifetime trusted health partner for the consumers we are privileged to serve. In the first quarter, we made tangible progress on our strategic initiatives, notably in Carelon, where we continue to scale our flywheel for enterprise growth. Carelon Rx closed its acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, a leading provider of infusion services. We are looking forward to expanding its geographic reach and therapeutic coverage to serve more consumers and Elevance Health members for years to come. As Carelon Rx furthers our enterprise commitment to address the whole health needs of our members, notably those with chronic and complex conditions, we are accelerating the buildout of our own specialty pharmacy. For example, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire Kroger's Specialty Pharmacy business, the sixth largest specialty pharmacy in the country. The acquisition will bolster the growth of our existing pharmacy and infusion businesses while increasing Carelon Rx's access to limited distribution drugs. Carelon Services is also off to a strong start this year as we implemented and were awarded multiple new contracts, a testament to the value Carelon services provides. For instance, Carelon Behavioral Health was selected by the Maryland Department of Health to provide behavioral health management services to more than 1.7 million Medicaid members starting in 2025. And in California, our team will partner with the public school system to expand behavioral health management services for students later this year. This initiative represents a major step forward in addressing the critical need for mental health support in educational settings and demonstrates our commitment to improving the health and well-being of our communities. Momentum with external clients is building and underscores the value Carelon Services is creating for health plan customers through better consumer experiences and improved affordability. Our health benefits business is similarly off to a solid start. Commercial margin continues to recover from pandemic era lows, and we are enjoying momentum in membership growth, notably in our individual ACA plans and among large self-insured employers. Existing clients are demonstrating their confidence in our offerings by consolidating their business with us after years of offering our solutions side by side with those of our competitors. In our Medicaid business, we were pleased to be selected in Florida and Virginia to serve beneficiaries across traditional and complex populations statewide, including those with serious mental illness in Florida and sole source foster care in Virginia. These awards and their pull-through opportunities for Carelon services underscore the distinct value Elevance Health delivers. In the first quarter, our Medicaid business performed in line with our expectations. We estimate that nearly 90% of our members have had their eligibility redetermined. Further, our team continues to work tirelessly to maximize access to care for Medicaid members subject to eligibility redetermination, helping them to understand their options in the face of ongoing logistical and operational challenges. Holistically, we are proud of the work we have done in contacting more than 4.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries through our omni-channel approach. Nonetheless, a majority of members who have lost coverage for administrative reasons have not yet returned. We're seeing a gradual increase in Medicaid re-enrollment and anticipate continued upticks in rejoiner rates as more Medicaid beneficiaries recognize their need to re-enroll, aligned with the trends that we have observed in recent months. Turning to Medicare. We were pleased to announce last month that CMS updated the Star scores for four of our contracts, which increased the percentage of our members in four star or higher-rated contracts to nearly 50%, up from 34%. While this will improve our star quality bonus revenue in 2025, our goal is to have our star quality ratings at the high end of all plans in our local markets, which will be a multi-year journey. Funding for Medicare in 2025 will be challenging for the entire industry. We are disappointed that CMS has decided to cut Medicare Advantage rates for the second consecutive year, which will negatively impact seniors, notably those at the lower end of the income spectrum who rely on the program for their health and wellbeing. While we remain committed to serving seniors through plan offerings that focus on their unique needs, we will also continue to demonstrate discipline in our Medicare Advantage bids seeking to balance growth and margin while continuing to deliver exceptional value for seniors. Across the enterprise, our focus on delivering whole health for the consumers we are privileged to serve remains steadfast. We recently released our 2023 Advancing Health Together progress report, which underscores the strides we are making through value-based care. The report showcases examples of our success, facilitated by the unique partnerships that we've created with care providers across the healthcare ecosystem. I'd like to highlight a particular achievement that underscores our innovative approach to improving quality and value in healthcare. Recently, Elevance Health was honored by the NCQA with its Innovation Award, featuring quality accelerators in healthcare for leading-edge strategies that improve quality and value, specifically for our obstetrics specialty provider enablement program. The impact of these value-based partnerships and clinical interventions has led to consistent improvements in health outcomes and costs, including reducing preterm birth rates by 12% and low birth weight babies by 20%, all while improving access to timely prenatal care and postpartum follow-up. For those interested in learning more about these transformative initiatives and other examples of our progress, I encourage you to visit our Advancing Health Together website. In closing, I want to extend my deep gratitude to our 100,000 associates who embody our purpose of improving the health of humanity through their tireless commitment. It's also heartening to see their efforts recognized externally. We were honored to be named to Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work for list for the fourth year in a row. We were also included in their World's Most Admired Companies and America's Most Innovative Companies list. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mark Kaye to provide more on our operating results and outlook. Mark? Well, great. Thanks so much for the question, Lance. First, as I shared on in my opening comments, we're very excited about this partnership with CD&R, because it is very much the next step in our journey to bring value-based care to more consumers, specifically about partnering closely with care providers. And we see it as absolutely consistent to driving greater risk adoption and advancing our specialty enablement strategy as well. So it's very much a first step there. And as you said in your question, this aligns very closely with our strategy and our broad partnership focus to work directly with care providers in our local markets. And our goal again remains to increase more downside risk sharing in our value-based arrangements. I think, to take a step back, what makes this approach unique is that we're enabling value-based care across all lines of business. So, as I shared, the combined company is going to be payor-agnostic, and it's focused on enabling advanced primary care locally. And from the get-go, it's going to serve nearly 1 million consumers, and that's going to be across our commercial, Medicare and Medicaid health plans upon formation. Another thing I think is important is that it provides the opportunity to pull through Carelon services to support those patients and accelerate that specialty enablement for complex and chronic patients. We have been working with these management teams and these assets for some time and feel very confident about the alignment of our goals to serve as a lifetime trusted health partner. The goal gets back again to focusing on whole health, the needs of consumers, driving greater affordability, and fundamentally differentiate a consumer experience. A few things about the partnership too, and again, what makes it different for patients. They're going to have access to integrated teams. We're looking at personalized navigation, expanded digital assets, and specialized services. The primary care model is going to be built to be very distinctive, including community practices, purpose-built clinics, high-risk clinics, and digitally-enabled care models. So, as you can see, it's a fairly comprehensive approach. And the last thing I'd say is that employers in the market have not historically had access to a lot of these capabilities. And we have seen through the work that we're already doing, that this dedicated primary care capacity that integrates the clinical and benefits navigation with their specific health and wellness strategies is truly differentiating. So again, this is being purpose-built to work across all of the aspects of [Medicare, Medicare] (ph), commercial, not just a single business. So very much excited. We see this as an opportunity to accelerate innovation in the space and improve healthcare outcomes and consumer experiences. So thanks very much for the question. Next question, please. Thanks for the question, AJ. Let me maybe provide some broad-based comments and then I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more specificity on your questions. Now, I want to say first and foremost, I'm really proud of our teams and how they responded to this issue that occurred with Change quickly and effectively, first to protect our members and their data, and also help our care providers maintain their operations and cash flow. Importantly, I think it's important to note that from a perspective, we were not as significantly impacted by this and we are back to normal operations in terms of claims flow. Importantly, another thing that's really important to understand is our prior authorization provider payments and pharmacy claims were not materially impacted as well because they don't go through Change. We don't use Change significantly for those. So with that, I'll turn it over to Mark to provide a little more comments. But I think framing it overall, we feel that our teams acted quite quickly and really proud of our ability to work in the ecosystem to help support them. Thank you. Next question, please. Yeah, thanks for the question, Josh, because I think it very much aligns to the strategy that we've laid out. I guess first and foremost, it's payor-agnostic, and it was really important. We've always said that our goal, given the diversity of our business mix, serve all members across all business lines, given the depth and density of our membership on our local markets, that is very important. We had a partnership already working with many of these assets. So as I said, we know the membership -- we know the leadership teams, we know the value that can be created. And so, we have been working with them and feel quite good about what we can create. This is payor-agnostic, which we also think is very important. And again, this will help us continue through having a focus on advanced primary care, it's still very much focused on our chronic patients and complex patients. And we are still building specialty care enablement, which is, again, another very important component of what we're trying to probe through. So I think from that value-based care across all lines of business, a critical part of our strategy, very consistent, driving value-based care, continuing to drive much more downside risk, which means that we needed strong enabling capabilities to help practices work their way through that. We know that it takes time. It is also a technology-driven model. So one of the nice things about this partnership is that there are embedded technology assets to digitally-enabled care as well. And then we have a focus on patient access and experience in the adoption of next generation models. So again, consistent with the strategy that we've had over the last several years, not really a diversion, I think, from that. And I think the timing for us was right because we have been experimenting with multiple models and have a lot of experience in the space right now. So thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. Thanks, Ben. I'm going to have Pete probably provide a lot more context. But just quickly, about a third of the membership is under risk arrangement now. So with that, Pete, why don't you give a little more color into the relationship and how we see it evolve. Thank you. Next question, please. Thank you. I'm going to have Felicia Norwood address your questions. Next question, please. Next question, please. Next question, please. Great. Why don't I have Pete address sort of the Carelon questions and then Mark will talk about the earnings percentages. Pete? Thanks, Mark, and thanks for the question, Whit. And I just want to add to Pete's comments about just the momentum that we're seeing inside of Carelon. First, our proof points are within Elevance Health, and then secondarily now seeing some really nice momentum and traction externally. So thanks for the question. And next question, please. Thanks for the question, Nathan. As I shared in my opening comments, first of all, the Medicare rate announcement, as you've heard, represents the second year of consecutive cuts to the program that we know will result in increased premiums and reduced benefits for seniors with disabilities and particularly those that have really needed this program. Our approach is very consistent. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach to the Medicare business. Our focus is to get consistency, high-value competitive benefits, and balanced growth and margins. We're focused on building a sustainable, attractive, long-term business. It's too early to provide specifics for the 2025 bid at this stage, but again, I'm going to repeat, we're looking to really balance growth and margins. As we talked about in our Investor Day, our focus is on keeping our members Blue for life and there we're focused on particularly our 14 Blue states and continuing to prioritize the very significant business we have in DSNP where our unique competitive advantage is serving the needs of those consumers with complex conditions. So overall, we're in the midst of the process right now, so we'll have more as we get through the bid process, but thank you very much for the question. Next question, please. Next question, please. Thanks. Let me have Pete address your question. Yeah, in addition, I'll just add to what Pete said, to BioPlus, as you know, we also announced the acquisition of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, and that is also well aligned to Carelon's effort to control those levers that matter. So thank you for the question. Next question, please. Yeah, George, I think Felicia pretty much covered your question, which is, we think things are quite aligned at this point. So in terms of the acuity and the mix, everything, we have visibility into 75% of our Medicaid premiums. We've had very constructive discussions with our states. So, overall, we feel things are lining up. They're actuarially sound, and our conversations are ongoing. So, I feel very good about our Medicaid business, just to sort of put a finer point on that. In terms of Kroger, I'm going to ask Pete to comment on Kroger and how that's going to align with our broader pharmacy business. Next question, please. Next question, please. I'm going to ask Felicia to address that. Next question, please. Next question, please. Thank you, Mark. One more question, please. Well, thank you very much for your questions. Just in some closing thoughts, we're very pleased to be off to a solid start this year, and we're confident, as you heard in the ongoing execution of our strategy and the balance and resilience of our diverse set of businesses positions us well for 2024 and beyond. We're very excited about the future and look forward to sharing more on our progress with you in the coming year. Thank you for your interest in Elevance Health and have a great rest of your week."

            "content": "Thank you, Gail. As you heard earlier, our first quarter results reflect solid performance under a dynamic operating environment. We ended March with 46.2 million members reflecting Medicaid attrition, partially offset by ongoing momentum in our commercial business. During the quarter, we added nearly 400,000 commercial fee-based members, driven by strong retention and a successful national account selling season, and over 200,000 individual ACA members, given our attractive product positioning and coverage transitions away from Medicaid. Medicare Advantage membership declined slightly, as expected, given select market exits and the collective actions we continue to take to establish a strong foundation for profitable and sustainable growth over the long term. Operating revenue for the quarter was $42.3 billion, in line with our expectations. The consolidated benefit expense ratio of 85.6% improved 20 basis points year-over-year due to disciplined premium rate adjustments to reflect medical cost trends and the ongoing recovery of commercial margins from pandemic era lows. The adjusted operating expense ratio was 11.4%, consistent with the first quarter of 2023, indicative of our commitment to disciplined expense management and investment prioritization. Solid performance and growth in operating gain for both our health benefits and Carelon segments of $138 million and $72 million respectively, led to growth in consolidated adjusted operating gains of over 7%. Carelon Services had a particularly strong start to the year with revenue and operating earnings growth driven by risk based service line expansions and effective cost management, especially in our Carelon Insights and Carelon Behavioral Health businesses, further accelerating our enterprise flywheel or growth. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $2 billion, or approximately 0.9 times net income. With respect to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a debt to capital ratio of 39.4%, in line with our target range, preserving ongoing capital allocation flexibility. We repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $566 million during the quarter, underscoring our confidence in the intrinsic value of our shares and the long-term value proposition. We maintained our prudent and consistent approach to reserving. Days in claims payable stood at 49 days as of March 31st, up three days from the prior year quarter. This increase was largely driven by higher reserves associated with slower claims receipts due to an industry-wide disruption that impacted a major claims clearinghouse. As a reminder, we expect our days in claims payable to be in the low 40s range long term. I'd also like to take a moment to provide additional color on our strategic partnership with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. We are excited to partner with CD&R to scale what will be a best-in-class, payor agnostic advanced care delivery and enablement platform catering to the unique needs of consumers, regardless of their form of coverage. This collaboration will allow us to advance our local-oriented approach to care delivery based on the unique needs of the communities, consumers, and employers we are privileged to serve. At the onset, Elevance Health will hold a significant minority position in the combined business with a clear path to first majority and then full ownership in approximately five years. The formation of the strategic partnership includes our capital contribution in the form of cash and our equity interest in certain care delivery and enablement assets of Carelon Health as well as the conveyance from CD&R of our pre-health in Millennium Physician Group, and is subject to customary regulatory approvals. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and the solid start to the year. Momentum in our health benefits and Carelon businesses and the balance and resilience of our enterprise underscores our confidence in delivering another year of growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share consistent with our long-term compound annual growth rate of at least 12%. As we look forward to the rest of 2024, our focus will remain on successfully executing our strategy as we accelerate capabilities and services, invest in high growth opportunities, and optimize our health benefits business. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions. AJ, as you just heard from Gail, we acted quite responsibly to sever our network connections to Change Healthcare and to protect the data of both our members and providers. While we initially observed a 15% to 20% reduction in the daily volume of electronic data receipts from providers, most of which were claims related, in recent weeks our extensive efforts have led to a significant catch-up in outstanding claim volumes. And for the quarter, we are effectively caught up on claims receipts and are now working to complete all necessary claims adjudication and processing activities. As such, as part of the normal reserving practices, we've reflected the appropriate impact of the industry-wide disruption related to Change Healthcare in the reserves we've reported for our first quarter financials, and that ensures both consistency with historical practice and prudence. And then to your specific question, the impact here was to increase our sequential days in claims payable quarterly result by approximately 1.7 days. And then 1 quick financial remark just at the end of Pete's comments there. We do expect the consolidated entity once formed to have over $4 billion in annualized debt revenue. Lisa, thanks very much for the question. So utilization in the first quarter in our health benefits businesses was in line with our expectation and that was reflected in our reported benefit expense ratio of approximately 85.6%. In the commercial business, specifically inpatient and outpatient authorization levels year to date were aligned with our expectations and our internal year-to-go trend remains unchanged. On Medicare, as expected, we saw utilization related to both the two midnight rule for inpatient stays as well as pockets of outpatient authorizations around, for example, at radiology and cardiovascular procedures. And importantly, these trends were broadly planned for as part of our underlying cost trend assumptions. Medicaid, as you heard Felicia talk about a moment ago, did experience increased but state-specific utilization attributed to the redetermination, mix impacts, and we remain very comfortable with what we're seeing there given those ongoing constructive dialogues with the impacted states. And so overall, we remain confident that both our MA bids for 2024 and our commercial pricing really reflect the appropriate projections for utilization and medical cost trends. We were pleased to report our adjusted deleted EPS this quarter, which came in slightly better than our seasonal expectation. And that was led by solid performance in both our health benefits and Carelon divisions, where operating margin increased by 30 basis points and 20 basis points respectively, highlighting what we see as disciplined execution of our initiatives during a dynamic time for the industry. Of specific notes, and you referenced this in your question, was the favorable performance in the first quarter benefit expense ratio and that was driven by commercial margins that continue to recover from pandemic era lows. We're very pleased with the Q1 results. It's still early in the year and given our business is subject to some variability around medical cost trends, we're intentionally remaining thoughtful and prudent in our outlook and that led us to increase our guide for adjusted EPS by $0.10 to be greater than $37.20. On your second question, the seasonality of the adjusted diluted EPS in 2024 is expected to be consistent with the past several years with approximately 55% of earnings in the first half of the year. I also want to call out that workday seasonality, given it is a leap year, did result in a smaller than historically normal impact in the first quarter. But we expect the workday seasonality to put slightly more pressure on the third quarter MLR with an offsetting favorability than in the fourth quarter as those workdays normalize. Thank you very much for the question. You should see these two targets as synergistic. We remain firmly committed to achieving a long-term adjusted earnings per share CAGR of 12% to 15% through 2027 as we communicated at our Investor Day event last year. And then as we think more broadly around the long-term, we have confidence that through business cycles and over time, the earnings power of our health benefits and Carelon flywheel will generate the momentum and the foundation that's needed to sustain a long-term compound annual growth rate of at least 12%. Thank you very much for the question. Margins were better than expected in the first quarter, and that aligned very well to very strong revenue growth in the quarter, given the launch of several new internal risk deals, which we expect to accelerate as the year goes on. We're not seeking to update our full year guidance at this time, given that both the seasonality of the business continues to evolve as we expand our risk-based revenue and the timing of new product launches is anticipated to result in some transitory quarterly volatility. But let me turn it over to Pete for a couple of minutes to talk about what we're doing. Gary, good morning and thank you for the questions. Let me start maybe with the margins and let me bring it up to the health benefits business segment to talk about first. So in terms of health benefits, the margins this quarter were very much in line with our expectations. It puts us squarely on track to achieve our guidance for the full year of an increase between 25 basis points and 50 basis points. I'm not looking necessarily to comment on a single business' margin, but you could expect Medicaid margins to normalize, given we already have line of sight, and you heard Felicia talk about this, into approximately 75% of the Medicaid premiums for 2024, and that we are comfortable with the actuarial soundness of the rates that we are seeing. Over the long term, Medicaid continues to normalize as we spoke about last quarter, and it is performing as expected. On the DCP, for 2024, if we look out through the end of the year, we're anticipating remaining in the mid to upper 40s range given Medicaid membership is expected to decline to within our guidance range of 8.8 million to 9.2 million members. And as you know, Medicaid has a slightly lower relative DCP compared to commercial, for example. And then over time, to reiterate the guidance, we do expect over the long term, DCPs to return to that more normalized range in the low 40s. On your first question, the sequential increase in days in claims payable at quarter result of 1.7 days is primarily related to the Change Healthcare. I just want to -- -maybe one clarification around this. It's worth noting that neither the decrease in claims receipts that we saw during the quarter or the reserve accrual that we took related to Change Healthcare had any discernible impact on our benefit expense ratio or P&L. And that's because we believe the reserve represents an amount we would otherwise have paid had there been no disruption. So you should think about this as overall for the quarter, incurred claims are completely consistent with our expectations. Given some of the notes that came out this morning, I also would like to just reiterate that we do expect operating cash flow to be at least $8.1 billion for the full year, reiterating our earlier guidance."

            "name": "Felicia Norwood",
            "content": "Good morning, Dave, and thank you for the question. Frankly, right now we're at a point where our Medicaid business is actually tracking very much in line with our expectations. As you referenced, we believe that about 90% of our members have had their eligibility redetermined. So as we go through the next few months, you certainly see this tapering down as we really wrap up the unwinding process as we get through June. One of the things I want to make sure you understand, the downward trend in membership in the first quarter resulted not just from re-determinations, but footprint changes as well. So it's really the cumulative impact of those two things in terms of the first quarter. When we think about the work that we will continue to do is we will continue to outreach to Medicaid members. Many members who have lost their membership at this point did that as a result of really procedural reasons. So the team will continue to be very aggressive around continuing the outreach that's been going on. And we're really proud of the work that we continue to do to really reach out to over 4.5 million people, as Gail referenced in the opening comments, to make sure that individuals who are truly eligible for Medicaid have access to Medicaid and, if not, are able to transition to an exchange product and continue coverage. In terms of where we are today with respect to, the acuity and mix of that membership, the acuity is in line with what we expected. And I will also say that at this point we have visibility into 75% of our Medicaid rates and premiums for 2024. The vast majority of those are in line with our expectations and they're actuarially sound. As you know, we have ongoing conversations with our state partners as we go throughout this process and we expect those rates to continue to be actuarially sound. So we're going to continue to work with our state partners. We're going to continue the advocacy with our members in terms of making sure they have access to care and coverage. And we're going to make sure that we go through this process with a lot of discipline and rigor, understand the mix of our membership and the levers versus [payors] (ph) as we go through this process. Thank you for the question. So, good morning, Justin, and thank you for the question. There are significant changes coming for 2025, and I'll say this, it's early to provide specifics around what our 2025 strategy is going to be. But as Gail mentioned before, we are going to make sure that we have a very balanced approach as we think about the margins around our Medicare business and focus on those things that we believe bring the highest value to our members as we really work to make sure we have a competitive product in-market that meets the needs of those members that we're trying to serve with a lot of dynamic changes that are going on in the Medicare environment for 2025. So thank you for the question. So, good morning, Ann, and thank you. We are certainly very pleased with the results in Florida. It's a state that we have been partnering in for a long period of time, but certainly the win here allows us to expand our footprint and additionally serve some complex populations, particularly SMI, which will be very much kind of a collaboration with our Carelon Services business, so very excited about that. We are also very focused on our Virginia go-live, which is coming up in July as well. So a lot of work happening there. Outstanding at this point is certainly Georgia, where we will be defending our procurement with respect to our core business, as well as our foster care business in the state of Georgia, and feel very good about the work that we continue to do there in partnership with the state. In addition, we are very much focused on a couple of new geographies where we are bidding this year and look forward to hearing those results. But on top of that, the states are very much focused on specialty populations, and we see that as the opportunity for growth as we go forward. Medicaid is a very important business for us. Our recent RFP wins, I think, demonstrate the value that we bring to our state partners, but more importantly, the improvement in quality of outcomes that we are providing to Medicaid beneficiaries. So thank you very much for the question. And, Sarah, just on your question with respect to our Medicaid states and when our rates are up for renewal, we have roughly 10 states that renew in January, another state that renews in April, another nine that renew in July, and then the last two renew in the back half of the year in September and October."

            "name": "Peter Haytaian",
            "content": "That's great. Thanks for the question, Ben. And I'll give you a little bit more color on the assets and the capabilities. They really all have their distinct strengths. We see great opportunities, quite frankly, to cross-pollinate. When you think about MPG to your question on risk, they really are a leader in managing Medicare and commercial risk. And they've also got a very strong chassis I think, for future growth and a proven model in that regard in terms of acquiring and providing practices. So very strong at managing risk and a lot of capabilities in that regard. What's really interesting about apree and Gail referenced this is they've got a differentiating technology and navigation capabilities with a real strong focus on the commercial business. So a really nice entry point for us. We've been working on relationships already in this regard. And I'm really excited about that because we, obviously, as a company, have a really strong commercial footprint, a really nice entry point for us. And then, of course, Carelon Health advanced primary care which is a leader in managing the complex and the chronic and largely takes risk today. We see a tremendous opportunity in a variety of ways for that. One, from a technology perspective, state-of-the-art EMR that we can upgrade as well as from a growth perspective in terms of partnering with MPG and apree. And then finally, and Gail mentioned this, but I'll reiterate it, a tremendous opportunity to wrap around existing Carelon services to this arrangement that will create value for all three assets. So, appreciate the question. Yeah, thanks for the question. As it relates to Carelon external growth, we continue to see a really nice momentum in our build. I mean, for 2024, from an overall sales perspective, we've already this time of the year, exceeded what we did in all 2023. And you heard Gail mention in her prepared remarks several new wins, which we're really excited about, really growth across the portfolio with some notable wins in behavioral health. She mentioned winning a statewide account in Medicaid for Maryland, which we're really excited about, and then some new innovative solutions with large employers as well as wins in the state of California. And on the behavioral health side, also some select wins in the crisis space, so areas that we've been really focused on. In addition to that, we've had some notable wins with the Blues related to our insights business. We've talked about this before, but it's really critical that we prove some of our risk arrangements and our differentiated capabilities in Elevance and then port those to the Blues. And we've seen that play through with several notable wins. Lastly, I'd say we're excited about the \u201825 pipeline. We're obviously actively in the selling season, our pipeline is very rich. And again, I would say a large focus on our insights businesses, as well as our behavioral health businesses. Yeah, thanks for the question, Andrew. Listen, the integration of BioPlus is going well. As you know, we remain on an accelerated calendar regarding this. I'll just reiterate, we spent last year building out the infrastructure and the team, and we did begin migrating scripts in January of this year. And we're doing so really on a staged basis. So we'll continue to do the migration throughout \u201824 and into 2025 as it relates to the Elevance Health book of business. I'd say overall things are going well. The infrastructure build is going well in addition to the BioPlus dispensing facilities that are in place. We're live with one additional facility now as we speak and we have two more going live this year. So we feel very good about the capacity, not only with respect to the Elevance Health business, but business beyond that. So we're excited, we're on a path, and again it will be staged throughout \u201824 and \u201825. Yeah, George, thanks for the question on Kroger. And as Gail alluded to it, we're excited about this deal. It furthers the Carelon and the pharmacy strategy. It certainly is a natural extension of our recent arrangement with BioPlus. And just to give you some background, Kroger Specialty Pharmacy is the largest non-payer-owned specialty pharmacy. They do about 500,000 scripts a year, And it really is a natural complement to what we're doing with both BioPlus and Paragon, quite frankly. To give you a sense of what this is going to do for us, it's going to add meaningful scale. It increases our access to more LDDs, limited distribution drugs, which is very important. Certainly strengthens our relationship with manufacturers, enabling us to really provide greater affordability and quality. And in fact, it has a nice presence in Puerto Rico, which could be very helpful to our MMM business. As it relates to your question on transition of scripts, we feel very good about that. I mean, obviously, in this case with specialty pharmacy, providers and members have choice, but we feel very good about the execution model. We feel very good about the stickiness of the scripts, and we believe the integration and the transition will be straightforward. We expect the arrangement to likely close in Q3 and Q4 this year. Yeah, no, it's appreciated. And Mark's really covered it. But think about it this way. We are launching some pretty significant risk arrangements this year. We've talked about it, but a full risk arrangement in oncology, a full risk arrangement with the seriously mentally ill. And you should think about this as a natural cadence to launching this throughout the year, and that's what's going to impact the margins. So, for example, with the seriously mentally ill, we're doing this largely with the Medicaid business. It's not a big bang across all the Medicaid states immediately, as you'd expect. It's more methodical state by state in \u201824 and \u201825."
